              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Episodic boundary cells in human medial temporal lobe during the free recall task</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A necessary condition for forming episodic memories is the construction of specific episodes demarcated from other episodes in space and time. Evidence from studies of episodic memory formation using rodent models suggest that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) supports the representation of boundary information. Building on recent work using human microelectrode recordings as well, we hypothesized of human MTL neurons with firing rates sensitive to episodic boundary information. We identified 27 episodic boundary neurons out of 736 single neurons recorded across 27 subjects. Firing of these neurons increased at the beginning and end of mnemonically relevant episodes in the free recall task. We distinguish episodic boundary neurons from a population of ramping neurons (<i>n</i> = 58), which are time-sensitive neurons whose activity provides complementary information during episodic representation. Episodic boundary neurons exhibited a U-shaped activity pattern demonstrating increased activity after both beginning and end boundaries of encoding and retrieval epochs. We also describe evidence that the firing of boundary neurons within episodic boundaries is organized by hippocampal theta oscillations, using spike-field coherence metrics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Dominant role of adult neurogenesis‐induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and synapses manifest pronounced variability in the amount of plasticity induced by identical activity patterns. The mechanisms underlying such plasticity heterogeneity, which have been implicated in context-specific resource allocation during encoding, have remained unexplored. Here, we employed a systematic physiologically constrained parametric search to identify the cellular mechanisms behind plasticity heterogeneity in dentate gyrus granule cells. We used heterogeneous model populations to ensure that our conclusions were not biased by parametric choices in a single hand-tuned model. We found that each of intrinsic, synaptic, and structural heterogeneities independently yielded heterogeneities in synaptic plasticity profiles obtained with two different induction protocols. However, among the disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities, our analyses demonstrated the dominance of neurogenesis-induced structural heterogeneities in driving plasticity heterogeneity in granule cells. We found that strong relationships between neuronal intrinsic excitability and plasticity emerged only when adult neurogenesis-induced heterogeneities in neural structure were accounted for. Importantly, our analyses showed that it was not imperative that the manifestation of neural-circuit heterogeneities must translate to heterogeneities in plasticity profiles. Specifically, despite the expression of heterogeneities in structural, synaptic, and intrinsic neuronal properties, similar plasticity profiles were attainable across all models through synergistic interactions among these heterogeneities. We assessed the parametric combinations required for the manifestation of such degeneracy in the expression of plasticity profiles. We found that immature cells showed physiological plasticity profiles despite receiving afferent inputs with weak synaptic strengths. Thus, the high intrinsic excitability of immature granule cells was sufficient to counterbalance their low excitatory drive in the expression of plasticity profile degeneracy. Together, our analyses demonstrate that disparate forms of neural-circuit heterogeneities could mechanistically drive plasticity heterogeneity, but also caution against treating neural-circuit heterogeneities as proxies for plasticity heterogeneity. Our study emphasizes the need for quantitatively characterizing the relationship between neural-circuit and plasticity heterogeneities across brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Granule cell dispersion in two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy and reeler mice is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by hippocampal neuronal death in CA1 and hilus. Dentate gyrus granule cells survive but show dispersion of the compact granule cell layer. This is associated with decrease of the glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates neuron migration and dendrite outgrow. Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice show no layering, their granule cells are dispersed throughout the dentate gyrus. We studied granule cell dendritic orientation and distribution of postsynaptic spines in reeler mice and two mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy, namely the p35 knockout mice, which show Reelin-independent neuronal migration defects, and mice with unilateral intrahippocampal kainate injection. Granule cells were Golgi-stained and analyzed, using a computerized camera lucida system. Granule cells in naive controls exhibited a vertically oriented dendritic arbor with a small bifurcation angle if positioned proximal to the hilus and a wider dendritic bifurcation angle, if positioned distally. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed a dispersed granule cell layer, granule cells showed basal dendrites with wider bifurcation angles, which lost position-specific differences. Reeler mice lacked dendritic orientation. P35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice showed increased dendritic spine density in the granule cell layer. Molecular layer dendrites showed a reduced spine density in kainate-injected mice only, whereas in p35 knockouts no reduced spine density was seen. Reeler mice showed a homogenous high spine density. We hypothesize that granule cells migrate in temporal lobe epilepsy, develop new dendrites which show a spread of the dendritic tree, create new spines in areas proximal to mossy fiber sprouting, which is present in p35 knockout- and kainate-injected mice and loose spines on distal dendrites if mossy cell death is present, as it was in kainate-injected mice only. These results are in accordance with findings in epilepsy patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Pregnane neurosteroids exert opposite effects on GABA and glycine‐induced chloride current in isolated rat neurons</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of endogenous neurosteroids (NSs) with pregnane skeleton modified at positions C-3 and C-5 to modulate the functional activity of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyR) and ionotropic ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) was estimated. The glycine and GABA-induced chloride current (<i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>) were measured in isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus and in isolated rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, respectively. Our experiments demonstrated that pregnane NSs affected <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> in a different manner. At low concentrations (up to 5 μM), tested pregnane NSs increased or did not change the peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>, but reduced the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> by decreasing the peak amplitude and/or accelerating desensitization. Namely, allopregnanolone (ALLO), epipregnanolone (EPI), pregnanolone (PA), pregnanolone sulfate (PAS) and 5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP) enhanced the <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub> in Purkinje cells. Dose–response curves plotted in the concentration range from 1 nM to 100 μM were smooth for EPI and 5β-DHP, but bell-shaped for ALLO, PA and PAS. The peak amplitude of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> was reduced by PA, PAS, and 5α- and 5β-DHP. In contrast, ALLO, ISO and EPI did not modulate it. Dose–response curves for the inhibition of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> peak amplitude were smooth for all active compounds. All NSs accelerated desensitization of the <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub>. The dose–response relationship for this effect was smooth for ALLO, PA, PAS and 5β-DHP, but it was U-shaped for EPI, 5α-DHP and ISO. These results, together with our previous results on NSs with androstane skeleton, offer comprehensive overview for understanding the mechanisms of effects of NSs on <i>I</i>
<sub>Gly</sub> and <i>I</i>
<sub>GABA</sub>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Neuroplastic changes in c‐Fos, ΔFosB, BDNF, trkB, and Arc expression in the hippocampus of male Roman rats: differential effects of sexual activity</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sexual activity causes differential changes in the expression of markers of neural activation (c-Fos and ΔFosB) and neural plasticity (Arc and BDNF/trkB), as determined either by Western Blot (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and ΔFosB) or immunohistochemistry (BDNF, trkB, Arc, and c-Fos), in the hippocampus of male Roman high (RHA) and low avoidance (RLA) rats, two psychogenetically selected rat lines that display marked differences in sexual behavior (RHA rats exhibit higher sexual motivation and better copulatory performance than RLA rats). Both methods showed (with some differences) that sexual activity modifies the expression levels of these markers in the hippocampus of Roman rats depending on: (i) the level of sexual experience, that is, changes were usually more evident in sexually naïve than in experienced rats; (ii) the hippocampal partition, that is, BDNF and Arc increased in the dorsal but tended to decrease in the ventral hippocampus; (iii) the marker considered, that is, in sexually experienced animals BDNF, c-Fos, and Arc levels were similar to those of controls, while ΔFosB levels increased; and (iv) the rat line, that is, changes were usually larger in RHA than RLA rats. These findings resemble those of early studies in RHA and RLA rats showing that sexual activity influences the expression of these markers in the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area, and show for the first time that also in the hippocampus sexual activity induces neural activation and plasticity, events that occur mainly during the first phase of the acquisition of sexual experience and depend on the genotypic/phenotypic characteristics of the animals.</p>

	<p>Diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of neurological diseases are limited by the poor specificity and limited resolution of currently available techniques. Analysis of circulating cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has emerged as a promising strategy for the diagnosis, molecular characterization, and monitoring of neurological disease. In comparison to bulk sequencing analysis, single-cell sequencing studies can provide novel insights into rare cell populations and uncover heterogeneity in gene expression at a single-cell resolution, which has several implications for understanding disease pathology and treatment. Parallel development of standardized biofluid collection protocols, pre-processing strategies, reliable single-cell isolation strategies, downstream genomic analysis, and robust computational analysis is paramount for comprehensive single-cell sequencing analysis. Here we perform a comprehensive review of studies focusing on single-cell sequencing of cells in the CSF of patients with oncological or non-oncological diseases of the central nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Single blind, randomized study comparing clinical equivalence of Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures for mucosal closure following surgical removal of mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar is a common dental anomaly, for which surgical extraction is required. Post-surgery closure of mucosa reduces the prevalence of pain and other surgery-associated complications. We compared tissue reaction/inflammation after 3 and 7 days of mucosal closure with Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures, following impacted mandibular third molar removal. Methods: This multicenter, prospective, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized (1:1), single-blind study (July 2020-November 2021) included subjects (Trusilk®, n=65 and Mersilk®, n=64), requiring mucosal suturing following impacted mandibular third molar removal. The primary endpoint, incidence of pain, swelling and trismus at the extraction area on post-surgery day 3 and 7 was evaluated. The secondary endpoints, incidence of tissue reaction, wound infection, suture loosening, other complications, operative time, amount of anesthesia, intraoperative suture handling, time needed for complete wound healing and suture removal, and adverse events were also recorded. Results: Socio-demographic and intra-oral characteristics were comparable between the groups. In Trusilk® and Mersilk® groups, a gradually decreasing pain score, starting from day 0 post-surgery (42.17±22.38 vs. 45.97±22.20) to day 7 (8.40±11.93 vs. 8.28±12.13) to day 30 (1.98±0.89 vs. 1.75±0.76) was witnessed. After the surgery, 21.54% and 17.19% subjects in Trusilk® and Mersilk® groups, respectively, had no post-operative swelling, while at the last two visits none of the subjects had swelling. Non-significant difference in wound infection, suture loosening, wound healing, bleeding, taste changes, operative time, amount of anesthesia, intraoperative suture handling, and time needed for complete wound healing and suture removal was noted among the groups. No suture-related adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: The results indicated that the Trusilk® and Mersilk® silk sutures are clinically equivalent and can be used for mucosal closure after removal of an impacted mandibular third molar with a minimal rate of pain, swelling and trismus.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The Mauthner cells are a pair of large reticulospinal neurons that organize sensory-evoked tail flip responses in fishes. An identifiable group of auditory "mixed" (electrical and chemical) synaptic contacts known as "Large Myelinated Club endings" on these cells have provided a valuable model for the study of synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain. While most of studies were performed in adult fish, we describe here methods that make possible recording synaptic transmission from these contacts in developing zebrafish, a genetically tractable vertebrate species which is uniquely amenable for combining synaptic physiology with live imaging and behavioral analysis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Universal Guide for Skull Extraction and Custom-Fitting of Implants to Continuous and Discontinuous Skulls</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide transcranial access to the brain. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naive animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails, if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs with constant material thickness along the skull curvature, e.g., to allow fixed screw lengths. We present a universal step-by-step guide for custom-fitting implants which overcomes these limitations. It is suited for unusual skull conditions, like surface discontinuities or irregularities and includes virtual bending as a process to match skull surfaces while maintaining implant thickness. We demonstrate its applicability for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multicomponent implant systems built on even or discontinuous skull. The guide uses only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. A detailed description of this process is available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions suitable for users without any prior knowledge in CAD programming. We report the experience with these implants over several years in 11 rhesus monkeys.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Biomarker of Photosensitive Epilepsy from Interictal EEG</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>People with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) are prone to seizures elicited by visual stimuli. The possibility of inducing epileptiform activity in a reliable way makes PSE a useful model to understand epilepsy, with potential applications for the development of new diagnostic methods and new treatments for epilepsy. A relationship has been demonstrated between PSE and both occipital and more widespread cortical hyperexcitability using various types of stimulation. Here we aimed to test whether hyperexcitability could be inferred from resting interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) data without stimulation. We considered a cohort of 46 individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy who underwent EEG during intermittent photic stimulation: 26 had a photoparoxysmal response (PPR), the PPR group, and 20 did not, the non-PPR group. For each individual, we computed functional networks from the resting EEG data before stimulation. We then placed a computer model of ictogenicity into the networks and simulated the propensity of the network to generate seizures <I>in silico</I> [the brain network ictogenicity (BNI)]. Furthermore, we computed the node ictogenicity (NI), a measure of how much each brain region contributes to the overall ictogenic propensity. We used the BNI and NI as proxies for testing widespread and occipital hyperexcitability, respectively. We found that the BNI was not higher in the PPR group relative to the non-PPR group. However, we observed that the (right) occipital NI was significantly higher in the PPR group relative to the non-PPR group. Other regions did not have significant differences in NI values between groups.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with the presence of cataracts in the Peruvian population older than 50 years: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cataracts are a public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where the greatest limitations of health care systems are observed, making access to treatment difficult. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with the presence of cataracts in adults over 50 years of age in Peru. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical observational study was performed of data from the 2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES – acronym in Spanish). The dependent variable was the self-reported diagnosis of cataracts (yes or no). Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated using a generalized linear model of the Poisson family with a log link function to estimate factors associated with self-reported cataract diagnosis. Results: We analyzed the data of 8775 Peruvian adults older than 50 years; 1322 (16.68%) self-reported a diagnosis of cataract. A higher prevalence of having cataracts was associated with being aged 60-69 years (aPR: 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.61) and 70 years and older (aPR: 2.78; 95% CI: 2.44-3.18), identifying as being of native ethnicity (aPR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16-1.47), having undergone ophthalmologic evaluation in the last 12 months (aPR: 2.29; 95% CI: 2.07-2.53) and having diabetes mellitus (aPR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.13-1.51). The prevalence of cataracts was lower in subjects belonging to the poorest wealth quintile (aPR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.43-0.70) and those with a higher level of education (aPR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.88). Conclusions: In Peru, one out of six adults older than 50 years self-reported a diagnosis of cataracts. People older than 60 years, being of native ethnicity, having had a visual acuity evaluation in the last 12 months and having diabetes were associated with a higher prevalence of cataracts. These factors should be considered when implementing strategies for health education, promotion and prevention to ensure access to early ophthalmologic care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">E-Wallet: A Study on Cashless Transactions Among University Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                E-wallet is an application that enable users to download payment cards using a mobile device. It is a new trend for consumers to use an e-wallet application to replace the traditional payment method. With E-wallet, a user does not need to bring cash or a credit card along with them. It enables users to make purchases in a more convenient way. Hence, this research analyses the factors that affect university students’ intention to use e-wallet. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) serves as the theory underpinning this research A total of 140 respondents from a Malaysian private institution participated in this study. Convenience sampling was used to select samples, and respondents completed the questionnaire using a Google form and a paper and pencil approach. The questionnaire was created using a nominal scale and a five-point Likert scale. Descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, and multiple regression analyses were utilised to analyse the data in this study. Students, supervisors, academics, researchers, learning institutions, commercial organisations, and the government will all benefit immensely from the data and information gathered from this study as we will be able to examine and understand the factors that influence students' decision to use an e-Wallet for their daily financial operations. This study, however, has certain limitations as it does not reflect the complete student population in Malaysian tertiary education and only examines four variables: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, and trust. Future studies could focus on other impacting elements such as risk, complexity, pervasive technology use and tech-savvy future generations.

                Background: Respiratory insufficiency is the most common cause of mortality among patients with a neuromuscular disease. Methods: We followed the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews. We explored the effects of high frequency wall compression and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, compared to a control intervention, on the lung volume and capacity, and quality of life in patients with neuromuscular disease. We further assessed the effects of these two interventions on clinical value, complications, and survival. The literature search was performed on 30/06/2020 in Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro and CINAHL on 6/07/2020. Inclusion criteria: patients with neuromuscular disease; interventions of interest mentioned above; randomised controlled trials comparing these interventions with a control intervention. Results: Five studies were included, and results were presented narratively. High frequency wall compression was not shown to be superior to standard care in terms of lung volume and capacity, quality of life, complications, and survival rate. Compared with standard care, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation showed non-significant differences in terms of lung volume and capacity, and the risk of respiratory infection. Standard care was nevertheless associated with a significantly higher risk of days of hospitalisation (Incidence Rate Ratio 8.5 [1.1-67]) and of antibiotic use than intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (Incidence Rate Ratio 43 [6-333]). The assessment with the risk of bias tool 2.0 showed a high risk of bias for all outcomes. Moreover, the evidence is of very low-quality for all outcomes. Conclusions: Due to large variety of reported outcomes, missing data and limited number of studies, no meta-analysis could be conducted. The results should be interpreted with caution as the results have a very low certainty of evidence and reported outcomes have a high risk of bias. The evidence for high frequency wall compression and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation is still insufficient to draw final conclusions. Registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42017064703.

                Background: Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is underdiagnosed and is difficult to detect. The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross‐sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: “Off” and “On” state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40–86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10-3). Conclusions: EncephalApp Stroop test was an efficient screening tool for CHE in Tunisian cirrhotic patients.

                Long QT syndrome is a genetically inherited heart disease caused by mutations in genes coding for the ion channels expressed in the heart cells. Like any other hereditary pathology Long QT Syndrome manifestations often start at a young age. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented a syncope after taking antidepressants, revealing a congenital long QT syndrome. The onset of cardiovascular symptoms in elderly subjects with such an unrecognized entity is very rare and is most often due to transient biological disturbances or to the use of certain drugs, which prolong the QT interval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus in East Java, Indonesia: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Diabetes mellitus has been perceived as the worsening factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where diabetes mellitus patients with pre-existing inflammatory condition could develop acute respiratory disease syndrome as well as multi-organ dysfunction. Managing diabetes mellitus amidst severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is also a matter of concern as several antidiabetic therapies could affect the progression of COVID-19. This study aimed to provide the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus receiving blood glucose lowering therapies and COVID-19 symptomatic treatments. Methods: This retrospective study was performed on 260 medical records of patients hospitalized between May 2020 to February 2021 in East Java, Indonesia. Patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive based on the results from real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasal swab samples collected on hospital admission. Data included were demographic characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms, severity of COVID-19, comorbidities (other than diabetes mellitus), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and 2-hours post-prandial blood glucose (2hPBG), and outcomes. Results: Most of the patients had age range of 41–60 years old (76.1%) with more than a half of the subjects (60%) were obese. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes were distributed evenly among the COVID-19 severities (74.3% in asymptomatic group, 73.6% in mild group, and 74.1% in moderate group). There were reductions in FBG and 2hPBG levels measured before (210.75±81.38 and 271.19±100.7 mg/dL, respectively) and after the treatment (181.03±68.9 and 222.01±86.96 mg/dL, respectively). All patients received multivitamin and symptomatic treatment for COVID-19. Oral antidiabetic drug (57.6%) and insulin (28.8%) were administered to lower the blood glucose level of the patients. As many as 96.9% patients survived, while 3.1% died. Conclusion: COVID-19 could affect the blood glucose level, suggesting the importance of antihyperglycemic therapies among patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional study of Malaysian low-income drug addict wives: Relationship between family impact, coping and mental wellbeing [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The involvement of the husbands in the issue of drug addiction has impacted the wives’ livelihoods. Due to drug addiction amongst husbands, the wives experience stress and strain. The Stress Strain Coping Support Model (SSCS) was established to better comprehend how coping influences stress and strain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the stress which refers to family impact experienced by the wives of drug addicts, in terms of economic difficulties and marital conflict, and mental wellbeing. Furthermore, this study examines the role of coping as a mediating factor between family impact and mental wellbeing. Methods: This study involved 132 wives of low-income drug addicts in Malaysia, who were selected using a purposive sampling method. Economic Strain Scale (ESS) and Braiker-Kelly Marital Conflict Scale (BKMCS) were used to measure family impact. Coping and Adaptation Processing Scale Short Form (CAPS-SF) and Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) were used to measure coping and mental wellbeing of the respective respondents. Results: Path analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.3.7 showed that there is a direct association between family impact and coping, and between coping and mental wellbeing. The results also showed that family impact was associated indirectly with mental wellbeing through coping.  Conclusions: The findings benefited drug addict wives and practitioners related to this field in terms of enhancing the use of coping mechanisms in managing family impact and improving mental wellbeing, specifically amongst low-income drug addict wives.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Remote sensing and machine learning for yield prediction of lowland paddy crops [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Paddy is one of the crops with the largest production worldwide, after corn and wheat. In Indonesia, paddy crops play a role as one of the main boosters of national economic growth based on their contribution to Indonesia's gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, it is imperative to do research aimed at predicting the yield of paddy crops. Methods: This research exploits the technology of remote sensing and machine learning methods (i.e. Gradient Boosting Regressor) to predict the yield of lowland paddy crops. Remote sensing with a Landsat 8 satellite was used to obtain the input data in the form of the vegetation index (i.e. NDVI) value, surface temperature, and total pixels of the observed area. Afterward, the input data was arranged into training data by combining paddy yield data and the paddy harvest period. Results: The obtained training data was modelled to predict the yield of paddy crops using a Gradient Boosting Regressor. The results obtained from experiments conducted in Bandung, Indonesia, showed the scenario with the best parameter combination is an estimator of 2000, a learning rate of 0.001, minimum samples split of 2, and a maximum depth of 4, which has RMSE of 9766.72. Conclusions: This research succeeded in designing a computational model to predict the yield of lowland paddy crops by involving remote sensing and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sequence learning, prediction, and replay in networks of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Younes Bouhadjar, Markus Diesmann, Dirk J. Wouters, Tom Tetzlaff</p>

Sequence learning, prediction and replay have been proposed to constitute the universal computations performed by the neocortex. The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm realizes these forms of computation. It learns sequences in an unsupervised and continuous manner using local learning rules, permits a context specific prediction of future sequence elements, and generates mismatch signals in case the predictions are not met. While the HTM algorithm accounts for a number of biological features such as topographic receptive fields, nonlinear dendritic processing, and sparse connectivity, it is based on abstract discrete-time neuron and synapse dynamics, as well as on plasticity mechanisms that can only partly be related to known biological mechanisms. Here, we devise a continuous-time implementation of the temporal-memory (TM) component of the HTM algorithm, which is based on a recurrent network of spiking neurons with biophysically interpretable variables and parameters. The model learns high-order sequences by means of a structural Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanism supplemented with a rate-based homeostatic control. In combination with nonlinear dendritic input integration and local inhibitory feedback, this type of plasticity leads to the dynamic self-organization of narrow sequence-specific subnetworks. These subnetworks provide the substrate for a faithful propagation of sparse, synchronous activity, and, thereby, for a robust, context specific prediction of future sequence elements as well as for the autonomous replay of previously learned sequences. By strengthening the link to biology, our implementation facilitates the evaluation of the TM hypothesis based on experimentally accessible quantities. The continuous-time implementation of the TM algorithm permits, in particular, an investigation of the role of sequence timing for sequence learning, prediction and replay. We demonstrate this aspect by studying the effect of the sequence speed on the sequence learning performance and on the speed of autonomous sequence replay.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Towards a more general understanding of the algorithmic utility of recurrent connections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brett W. Larsen, Shaul Druckmann</p>

Lateral and recurrent connections are ubiquitous in biological neural circuits. Yet while the strong computational abilities of feedforward networks have been extensively studied, our understanding of the role and advantages of recurrent computations that might explain their prevalence remains an important open challenge. Foundational studies by Minsky and Roelfsema argued that computations that require propagation of global information for local computation to take place would particularly benefit from the sequential, parallel nature of processing in recurrent networks. Such “tag propagation” algorithms perform repeated, local propagation of information and were originally introduced in the context of detecting connectedness, a task that is challenging for feedforward networks. Here, we advance the understanding of the utility of lateral and recurrent computation by first performing a large-scale empirical study of neural architectures for the computation of connectedness to explore feedforward solutions more fully and establish robustly the importance of recurrent architectures. In addition, we highlight a tradeoff between computation time and performance and construct hybrid feedforward/recurrent models that perform well even in the presence of varying computational time limitations. We then generalize tag propagation architectures to propagating multiple interacting tags and demonstrate that these are efficient computational substrates for more general computations of connectedness by introducing and solving an abstracted biologically inspired decision-making task. Our work thus clarifies and expands the set of computational tasks that can be solved efficiently by recurrent computation, yielding hypotheses for structure in population activity that may be present in such tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Error-based or target-based? A unified framework for learning in recurrent spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cristiano Capone, Paolo Muratore, Pier Stanislao Paolucci</p>

The field of recurrent neural networks is over-populated by a variety of proposed learning rules and protocols. The scope of this work is to define a generalized framework, to move a step forward towards the unification of this fragmented scenario. In the field of supervised learning, two opposite approaches stand out, error-based and target-based. This duality gave rise to a scientific debate on which learning framework is the most likely to be implemented in biological networks of neurons. Moreover, the existence of spikes raises the question of whether the coding of information is rate-based or spike-based. To face these questions, we proposed a learning model with two main parameters, the rank of the feedback learning matrix R and the tolerance to spike timing <i>τ</i><sub>⋆</sub>. We demonstrate that a low (high) rank R accounts for an error-based (target-based) learning rule, while high (low) tolerance to spike timing promotes rate-based (spike-based) coding. We show that in a store and recall task, high-ranks allow for lower MSE values, while low-ranks enable a faster convergence. Our framework naturally lends itself to Behavioral Cloning and allows for efficiently solving relevant closed-loop tasks, investigating what parameters ( R , τ ⋆ ) are optimal to solve a specific task. We found that a high R is essential for tasks that require retaining memory for a long time (Button and Food). On the other hand, this is not relevant for a motor task (the 2D Bipedal Walker). In this case, we find that precise spike-based coding enables optimal performances. Finally, we show that our theoretical formulation allows for defining protocols to estimate the rank of the feedback error in biological networks. We release a PyTorch implementation of our model supporting GPU parallelization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Neural circuit mechanisms of hierarchical sequence learning tested on large-scale recording data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Toshitake Asabuki, Prajakta Kokate, Tomoki Fukai</p>

The brain performs various cognitive functions by learning the spatiotemporal salient features of the environment. This learning requires unsupervised segmentation of hierarchically organized spike sequences, but the underlying neural mechanism is only poorly understood. Here, we show that a recurrent gated network of neurons with dendrites can efficiently solve difficult segmentation tasks. In this model, multiplicative recurrent connections learn a context-dependent gating of dendro-somatic information transfers to minimize error in the prediction of somatic responses by the dendrites. Consequently, these connections filter the redundant input features represented by the dendrites but unnecessary in the given context. The model was tested on both synthetic and real neural data. In particular, the model was successful for segmenting multiple cell assemblies repeating in large-scale calcium imaging data containing thousands of cortical neurons. Our results suggest that recurrent gating of dendro-somatic signal transfers is crucial for cortical learning of context-dependent segmentation tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combined computational modeling and experimental analysis integrating chemical and mechanical signals suggests possible mechanism of shoot meristem maintenance</a></h4>

Stem cell maintenance in multilayered shoot apical meristems (SAMs) of plants requires strict regulation of cell growth and division. Exactly how the complex milieu of chemical and mechanical signals interact in the central region of the SAM to regulate cell division plane orientation is not well understood. In this paper, simulations using a newly developed multiscale computational model are combined with experimental studies to suggest and test three hypothesized mechanisms for the regulation of cell division plane orientation and the direction of anisotropic cell expansion in the corpus. Simulations predict that in the Apical corpus, WUSCHEL and cytokinin regulate the direction of anisotropic cell expansion, and cells divide according to tensile stress on the cell wall. In the Basal corpus, model simulations suggest dual roles for WUSCHEL and cytokinin in regulating both the direction of anisotropic cell expansion and cell division plane orientation. Simulation results are followed by a detailed analysis of changes in cell characteristics upon manipulation of WUSCHEL and cytokinin in experiments that support model predictions. Moreover, simulations predict that this layer-specific mechanism maintains both the experimentally observed shape and structure of the SAM as well as the distribution of WUSCHEL in the tissue. This provides an additional link between the roles of WUSCHEL, cytokinin, and mechanical stress in regulating SAM growth and proper stem cell maintenance in the SAM.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient Bayesian inference for mechanistic modelling with high-throughput data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simon Martina Perez, Heba Sailem, Ruth E. Baker</p>

Bayesian methods are routinely used to combine experimental data with detailed mathematical models to obtain insights into physical phenomena. However, the computational cost of Bayesian computation with detailed models has been a notorious problem. Moreover, while high-throughput data presents opportunities to calibrate sophisticated models, comparing large amounts of data with model simulations quickly becomes computationally prohibitive. Inspired by the method of Stochastic Gradient Descent, we propose a <i>minibatch</i> approach to approximate Bayesian computation. Through a case study of a high-throughput imaging scratch assay experiment, we show that reliable inference can be performed at a fraction of the computational cost of a traditional Bayesian inference scheme. By applying a detailed mathematical model of single cell motility, proliferation and death to a data set of 118 gene knockdowns, we characterise functional subgroups of gene knockdowns, each displaying its own typical combination of local cell density-dependent and -independent motility and proliferation patterns. By comparing these patterns to experimental measurements of cell counts and wound closure, we find that density-dependent interactions play a crucial role in the process of wound healing.

Single-cell multi-omics assays offer unprecedented opportunities to explore epigenetic regulation at cellular level. However, high levels of technical noise and data sparsity frequently lead to a lack of statistical power in correlative analyses, identifying very few, if any, significant associations between different molecular layers. Here we propose SCRaPL, a novel computational tool that increases power by carefully modelling noise in the experimental systems. We show on real and simulated multi-omics single-cell data sets that SCRaPL achieves higher sensitivity and better robustness in identifying correlations, while maintaining a similar level of false positives as standard analyses based on Pearson and Spearman correlation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ROS and cGMP signaling modulate persistent escape from hypoxia in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lina Zhao, Lorenz Fenk, Lars Nilsson, Niko Paresh Amin-Wetzel, Nelson Javier Ramirez-Suarez, Mario de Bono, Changchun Chen</p>

The ability to detect and respond to acute oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) shortages is indispensable to aerobic life. The molecular mechanisms and circuits underlying this capacity are poorly understood. Here, we characterize the behavioral responses of feeding <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to approximately 1% O<sub>2</sub>. Acute hypoxia triggers a bout of turning maneuvers followed by a persistent switch to rapid forward movement as animals seek to avoid and escape hypoxia. While the behavioral responses to 1% O<sub>2</sub> closely resemble those evoked by 21% O<sub>2</sub>, they have distinct molecular and circuit underpinnings. Disrupting phosphodiesterases (PDEs), specific G proteins, or BBSome function inhibits escape from 1% O<sub>2</sub> due to increased cGMP signaling. A primary source of cGMP is GCY-28, the ortholog of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor. cGMP activates the protein kinase G EGL-4 and enhances neuroendocrine secretion to inhibit acute responses to 1% O<sub>2</sub>. Triggering a rise in cGMP optogenetically in multiple neurons, including AIA interneurons, rapidly and reversibly inhibits escape from 1% O<sub>2</sub>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging reveals that a 7% to 1% O<sub>2</sub> stimulus evokes a Ca<sup>2+</sup> decrease in several neurons. Defects in mitochondrial complex I (MCI) and mitochondrial complex I (MCIII), which lead to persistently high reactive oxygen species (ROS), abrogate acute hypoxia responses. In particular, repressing the expression of <i>isp-1</i>, which encodes the iron sulfur protein of MCIII, inhibits escape from 1% O<sub>2</sub> without affecting responses to 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Both genetic and pharmacological up-regulation of mitochondrial ROS increase cGMP levels, which contribute to the reduced hypoxia responses. Our results implicate ROS and precise regulation of intracellular cGMP in the modulation of acute responses to hypoxia by <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematic identification of molecular mediators of interspecies sensing in a community of 2 frequently coinfecting bacterial pathogens</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tiffany M. Zarrella, Anupama Khare</p>

Bacteria typically exist in dynamic, multispecies communities where polymicrobial interactions influence fitness. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions is critical for understanding and modulating bacterial behavior in natural environments. While bacterial responses to foreign species are frequently characterized at the molecular and phenotypic level, the exogenous molecules that elicit these responses are understudied. Here, we outline a systematic strategy based on transcriptomics combined with genetic and biochemical screens of promoter–reporters to identify the molecules from one species that are sensed by another. We utilized this method to study interactions between the pathogens <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> that are frequently found in coinfections. We discovered that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> senses diverse staphylococcal exoproducts including the metallophore staphylopine (StP), intermediate metabolites citrate and acetoin, and multiple molecules that modulate its iron starvation response. We observed that StP inhibits biofilm formation and that <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> can utilize citrate and acetoin for growth, revealing that these interactions have both antagonistic and beneficial effects. Due to the unbiased nature of our approach, we also identified on a genome scale the genes in <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> that affect production of each sensed exoproduct, providing possible targets to modify multispecies community dynamics. Further, a combination of these identified <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> products recapitulated a majority of the transcriptional response of <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> to <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> supernatant, validating our screening strategy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical isolates of both <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> and <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> also showed varying degrees of induction or responses, respectively, which suggests that these interactions are widespread among pathogenic strains. Our screening approach thus identified multiple <i>S</i>. <i>aureus</i> secreted molecules that are sensed by <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> and affect its physiology, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, and yielding new insight into the molecular basis of interactions between these 2 species.

                Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), with an incidence of 2-5 percent, is an uncommon source of unilateral adrenal mass and hyperaldosteronism. In Nepal, there is no literature on this uncommon adrenocortical cancer. A forty-year-old Nepalese army regular with resistant hypertension on various antihypertensive medicines presenting with a background of considerable weight loss decreased appetite, and repeated episodes of vomiting were described. His blood tests revealed hypokalemia and a high aldosterone/renin ratio. A tumor in the left adrenal gland was discovered during an abdominal CECT scan. He was operated on for left adrenal incidentaloma and the procedure was uneventful. We recommend clinicians suspect hyperaldosteronism in an adult with refractory hypertension and hypokalemia.

                Introduction: Faith and systems of beliefs are known to impact not only the emotional, but also the immunological state of believers in ways that we are just starting to understand. Moreover, clinical implications of previous studies are limited.  The aim of the “HEALING” (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) Study was to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting a chaplain coupled with biblical readings. Methods: Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to find those who were the most in need of an intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at the bedside (n= 20) or in the chapel (n= 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n=19). Blood samples were taken 30 minutes prior, and 60 minutes after the meeting to measure white blood cells (WBC), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where they were played an audiotape of readings of the same passage from the Bible (n=21). Results: Lymphocyte counts increased more often after the more successful visits, but the immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe=0.003) correlation was revealed between changes in lymphocytes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions: Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplains’ main message is understood.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Robustness of the aging effect of smiling against vertical facial orientation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous studies have shown that the association between smiling and youth is a misconception; smiling faces have been estimated to be older than neutral faces. Previous studies have indicated that this aging effect of smiling (AES) is due to eye wrinkles caused by the facial action of smiling. However, whether holistic processing for facial expressions is involved in AES has not been investigated. The present study aimed to clarify these issues. Methods: Participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment that had a 3 (facial expression: smiling/neutral/surprised) × 2 (facial orientation: upright/inverted) mixed design. Participants were presented with an upright or inverted face for each expression (neutral, smiling, and surprised) and were asked to estimate the individual’s age. Results: In total, 104 participants were included in the analysis. The results show that smiling faces were estimated to be older than neutral faces, whereas there was no significant difference between upright and inverted faces. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AES is not dependent on holistic processing.

                Rapid technological advances in the past decades have enabled molecular biologists to generate large-scale and complex data with affordable resource investments, or obtain such data from public repositories. Yet, many graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and senior researchers in the biosciences find themselves ill-equipped to analyze large-scale data. Global surveys have revealed that active researchers prefer short training workshops to fill their skill gaps. In this article, we focus on the challenge of delivering a short data analysis workshop to absolute beginners in computer programming. We propose that introducing R or other programming languages for data analysis as smart versions of calculators can help lower the communication barrier with absolute beginners. We describe this comparison with a few analogies and hope that other instructors will find them useful. We utilized these in our four-hour long training workshops involving participatory live coding, which we delivered in person and via videoconferencing. Anecdotal evidence suggests that our exposition made R programming seem easy and enabled beginners to explore it on their own.

                Background: Staff nurses face frequent emotional situations in their work environment. The constant contact with suffering patients, and the busy work environment, pose tremendous stress on nurses' physical and emotional health. The Emotional Intelligence skills of empathy, self-awareness, motivation, self-control, and keeping relationships, can help handle difficult emotions and allow nurses to work in an organized, calm, and professional way. This study aims to implement and assess the effectiveness of a training program developed by the investigator, tailored to the mental and emotional needs of staff nurses who are working in an organization. The study also aims to observe any significant change, correlation, and association in the staff nurses’ level of emotional intelligence, intrinsic motivation, self-compassion, emotional labor, and nurse-in-charges’ and patients’ perception of nursing care after the program. Methods: A quasi-experimental (one-group) study design was used in this study. The study will involve 80 staff nurses working in a selected hospital in India. The staff nurses will be selected from the hospital's general wards using convenience sampling. For the current study, a quasi-experimental design will be used. The investigator will deliver a training program, divided into four sessions of two hours each. Data will be collected from the participants at baseline and 3-months pre-intervention; and post-test data will be collected immediately after the intervention, at 3-month, and 6-month follow-up, to observe any significant change in the study variables before and after the intervention. Results: The current study primarily focuses on the vital aspect of developing emotional needs, for promoting a better work-life balance. Research findings from the study will significantly contribute to the evidence based Emotional Intelligence programs for staff nurses, and if proven effective, could be delivered extensively in the hospitals. Trial registration: The study is registered in June 2019 under the Central Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2019/08/020592).

                Given the socioeconomic and environmental differences between Mexico’s geographical regions, having a multi-campus system is common for private and public universities. Hence, students may choose to migrate from one campus to another. Although such a phenomenon is not properly students’ desertion, students’ migration impacts campus’ main indicators: enrollment growth goals, terminal efficiency, accreditation programs, and revenue. Thus, the campus of origin internalizes migration as students’ desertion. By considering a campus from a private multi-campus university in Baja California, Mexico, this study characterizes and predicts students’ migration and predicts by determining the socioeconomic and academic variables that impact the probability of moving to a different campus. Our database comprises quantitative and qualitative information of 356 dropout students from 2008 to 2018. Hence, we apply the logistic regression technique to build a predictive model; we found that the most significant predictive variables are the GPA results, age, financial support, and academic development. So, our main results characterize migrant students as having top grades, coming from the high school campus, and attending engineering programs. Surprisingly, economic variables are not significant in choosing to migrate from one campus to another.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Thousands of small, novel genes predicted in global phage genomes</a></h4>

              
                Fremin et al. use comparative genomics to predict more than 40,000 small-gene families in phage from diverse environments. Small genes are approximately 3-fold more prevalent in phage than prokaryotic genomes. This resource includes more than 5,000 anti-CRISPR small-gene families and more than 9,000 secreted or transmembrane small-gene families.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection drives a type I IFN signature in lung lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                Akter et al. identify transcriptional signatures in Mtb-infected murine lungs using single-cell RNA sequencing. Lymphocytes show the enrichment of the type I IFN signature, while NK cells show the enrichment of heat shock responses in Mtb-infected lungs. Higher expression of Ly6A is observed on the surface of activated lymphocytes following Mtb infection.

                Ma et al. conduct a joint profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility during amphioxus embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. With the datasets generated, a developmental tree for amphioxus cell fate commitment and lineage specification is constructed, and multiple markers for each lineage are identified and validated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sigma oscillations protect or reinstate motor memory depending on their temporal coordination with slow waves</a></h4>

              
                Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during post-learning sleep is known to enhance motor memory consolidation but the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial effect of auditory TMR on motor performance. At the neural level, TMR enhanced slow wave (SW) characteristics. Additionally, greater TMR-related phase-amplitude coupling between slow (0.5-2 Hz) and sigma (12-16 Hz) oscillations after the SW peak was related to higher TMR effect on performance. Importantly, sounds that were not associated to learning strengthened SW-sigma coupling at the SW trough. Moreover, the increase in sigma power nested in the trough of the potential evoked by the unassociated sounds was related to the TMR benefit. Altogether, our data suggest that, depending on their precise temporal coordination during post learning sleep, slow and sigma oscillations play a crucial role in either memory reinstatement or protection against irrelevant information; two processes that critically contribute to motor memory consolidation.

                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multitude of genetic risk factors and early biomarkers are known. Nevertheless, the causal factors responsible for initiating cognitive decline in AD remain controversial. Toxic plaques and tangles correlate with progressive neuropathology, yet disruptions in circuit activity emerge before their deposition in AD models and patients. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are potential candidates for dysregulating cortical excitability, as they display altered AP firing before neighboring excitatory neurons in prodromal AD. Here we report a novel mechanism responsible for PV hypoexcitability in young adult familial AD mice. We found that biophysical modulation of K<sub>v</sub>3 channels, but not changes in their mRNA or protein expression, were responsible for dampened excitability in young 5xFAD mice. These K<sup>+</sup> conductances could efficiently regulate near-threshold AP firing, resulting in gamma-frequency specific network hyperexcitability. Thus biophysical ion channel alterations alone may reshape cortical network activity prior to changes in their expression levels. Our findings demonstrate an opportunity to design a novel class of targeted therapies to ameliorate cortical circuit hyperexcitability in early AD.

                Gut disorders associated to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are combined with anxiety and depression. Evidence suggests that microbially produced neuroactive molecules, like γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can modulate the gut-brain axis. Two natural strains of <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> and one mutant were characterized <i>in vitro</i> for their GABA production and tested <i>in vivo</i> in rat by oral gavage for their antinociceptive properties. <i>L. lactis</i> NCDO2118 significantly reduced visceral hypersensitivity induced by stress due to its glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity. <i>L. lactis</i> NCDO2727 with similar genes for GABA metabolism but no detectable GAD activity had no <i>in vivo</i> effect, as well as the NCDO2118 ΔgadB mutant. The antinociceptive effect observed for the NCDO2118 strain was mediated by the production of GABA in the gastro-intestinal tract and blocked by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist. Only minor changes in the faecal microbiota composition were observed after the <i>L. lactis</i> NCDO2118 treatment. These findings reveal the crucial role of the microbial GAD activity of <i>L. lactis</i> NCDO2118 to deliver GABA into the gastro-intestinal tract for exerting antinociceptive properties <i>in vivo</i> and open avenues for this GRAS (Generally Recognized As safe) bacterium in the management of visceral pain and anxious profile of IBS patients.

                Surface-associated, coiled-coil M proteins of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (Strep A) disable human immunity through interaction with select proteins. However, coiled coils lack features typical of protein–protein interaction sites, and it is therefore challenging to understand how M proteins achieve specific binding, for example, with the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, leading to its neutralization. The crystal structure of a complex of LL-37 with M87 protein, an antigenic M protein variant from a strain that is an emerging threat, revealed a novel interaction mode. The M87 coiled coil unfurled and asymmetrically exposed its hydrophobic core to capture LL-37. A single LL-37 molecule was bound by M87 in the crystal, but in solution additional LL-37 molecules were recruited, consistent with a ‘protein trap’ neutralization mechanism. The interaction mode visualized crystallographically was verified to contribute significantly to LL-37 resistance in an M87 Strep A strain and was identified to be conserved in a number of other M protein types that are prevalent in human populations. Our results provide specific detail for therapeutic inhibition of LL-37 neutralization by M proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Projected resurgence of COVID-19 in the United States in July-December 2021 resulting from the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and faltering vaccination</a></h4>

              
                In Spring 2021, the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant began to cause increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in parts of the United States. At the time, with slowed vaccination uptake, this novel variant was expected to increase the risk of pandemic resurgence in the US in summer and fall 2021. As part of the COVID-10 Scenario Modeling Hub, an ensemble of nine mechanistic models produced six-month scenario projections for July-December 2021 for the United States. These projections estimated substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant, projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. The scenarios revealed that reaching higher vaccine coverage in July—December 2021 reduced the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially, with the expected impacts was largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. Despite accurate projection of COVID-19 surges occurring and timing, the magnitude was substantially underestimated 2021 by the models compared with the of the reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occurring during July-December, highlighting the continued challenges to predict the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination uptake remains critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower vaccination coverage. Higher vaccination goals at the onset of the surge of the new variant were estimated to avert over 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths, though may have had even greater impacts, considering the underestimated resurgence magnitude from the model.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vision-related convergent gene losses reveal SERPINE3's unknown role in the eye</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of research, knowledge about the genes that are important for development and function of the mammalian eye and are involved in human eye disorders remains incomplete. During mammalian evolution, mammals that naturally exhibit poor vision or regressive eye phenotypes have independently lost many eye-related genes. This provides an opportunity to predict novel eye-related genes based on specific evolutionary gene loss signatures. Building on these observations, we performed a genome-wide screen across 49 mammals for functionally uncharacterized genes that are preferentially lost in species exhibiting lower visual acuity values. The screen uncovered several genes, including <i>SERPINE3</i>, a putative serine proteinase inhibitor. A detailed investigation of 381 additional mammals revealed that <i>SERPINE3</i> is independently lost in 18 lineages that typically do not primarily rely on vision, predicting a vision-related function for this gene. To test this, we show that <i>SERPINE3</i> has the highest expression in eyes of zebrafish and mouse. In the zebrafish retina, <i>serpine3</i> is expressed in Müller glia cells, a cell type essential for survival and maintenance of the retina. A CRISPR-mediated knockout of <i>serpine3</i> in zebrafish resulted in alterations in eye shape and defects in retinal layering. Furthermore, two human polymorphisms that are in linkage with <i>SERPINE3</i> are associated with eye-related traits. Together, these results suggest that <i>SERPINE3</i> has a role in vertebrate eyes. More generally, by integrating comparative genomics with experiments in model organisms, we show that screens for specific phenotype-associated gene signatures can predict functions of uncharacterized genes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid adaptation of a complex trait during experimental evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M. tb</i>), is a leading cause of death due to infectious disease. TB is not traditionally associated with biofilms, but <i>M. tb</i> biofilms are linked with drug and immune tolerance and there is increasing recognition of their contribution to the recalcitrance of TB infections. Here, we used <i>M. tb</i> experimental evolution to investigate this complex phenotype and identify candidate loci controlling biofilm formation. We identified novel candidate loci, adding to our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying <i>M. tb</i> biofilm development. Under selective pressure to grow as a biofilm, regulatory mutations rapidly swept to fixation and were associated with changes in multiple traits, including extracellular matrix production, cell size, and growth rate. Genetic and phenotypic paths to enhanced biofilm growth varied according to the genetic background of the parent strain, suggesting that epistatic interactions are important in <i>M. tb</i> adaptation to changing environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nanoscale architecture and coordination of actin cores within the sealing zone of human osteoclasts</a></h4>

              
                Osteoclasts are unique in their capacity to degrade bone tissue. To achieve this process, osteoclasts form a specific structure called the sealing zone, which creates a close contact with bone and confines the release of protons and hydrolases for bone degradation. The sealing zone is composed of actin structures called podosomes nested in a dense actin network. The organization of these actin structures inside the sealing zone at the nano scale is still unknown. Here, we combine cutting-edge microscopy methods to reveal the nanoscale architecture and dynamics of the sealing zone formed by human osteoclasts on bone surface. Random illumination microscopy allowed the identification and live imaging of densely packed actin cores within the sealing zone. A cross-correlation analysis of the fluctuations of actin content at these cores indicates that they are locally synchronized. Further examination shows that the sealing zone is composed of groups of synchronized cores linked by a-actinin1 positive filaments, and encircled by adhesion complexes. Thus, we propose that the confinement of bone degradation mediators is achieved through the coordination of islets of actin cores and not by the global coordination of all podosomal subunits forming the sealing zone.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A nucleation barrier spring-loads the CBM signalosome for binary activation</a></h4>

              
                Immune cells activate in binary, switch-like fashion via large protein assemblies known as signalosomes, but the molecular mechanism of the switch is not yet understood. Here, we employed an in-cell biophysical approach to dissect the assembly mechanism of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, which governs NF-κB activation in both innate and adaptive immunity. We found that the switch consists of a sequence-encoded and deeply conserved nucleation barrier to ordered polymerization by the adaptor protein BCL10. The particular structure of the BCL10 polymers did not matter for activity. Using optogenetic tools and single-cell transcriptional reporters, we discovered that endogenous BCL10 is functionally supersaturated even in unstimulated human cells, and this results in a predetermined response to stimulation upon nucleation by activated CARD multimers. Our findings may inform on the progressive nature of age-associated inflammation, and suggest that signalosome structure has evolved via selection for kinetic rather than equilibrium properties of the proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using population selection and sequencing to characterize natural variation of starvation resistance in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Starvation resistance is important to disease and fitness, but the genetic basis of its natural variation is unknown. Uncovering the genetic basis of complex, quantitative traits such as starvation resistance is technically challenging. We developed a synthetic-population (re)sequencing approach using molecular inversion probes (MIP-seq) to measure relative fitness during and after larval starvation in <i>C. elegans</i>. We applied this competitive assay to 100 genetically diverse, sequenced, wild strains, revealing natural variation in starvation resistance. We confirmed that the most starvation-resistant strains survive and recover from starvation better than the most starvation-sensitive strains using standard assays. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) with the MIP-seq trait data and identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for starvation resistance, and we created near isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the effect of these QTL on the trait. These QTL contain numerous candidate genes including several members of the Insulin/EGF Receptor-L Domain (<i>irld</i>) family. We used genome editing to show that four different <i>irld</i> genes have modest effects on starvation resistance. Natural variants of <i>irld-39</i> and <i>irld-52</i> affect starvation resistance, and increased resistance of the <i>irld-39; irld-52</i> double mutant depends on <i>daf-16/FoxO</i>. DAF-16/FoxO is a widely conserved transcriptional effector of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), and these results suggest that IRLD proteins modify IIS, though they may act through other mechanisms as well. This work demonstrates efficacy of using MIP-seq to dissect a complex trait and it suggests that <i>irld </i>genes are natural modifiers of starvation resistance in <i>C. elegans</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A mechanistic model explains oscillatory slowing and neuronal hyperactivity in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and is linked to the spreading of pathological amyloid-{beta} and tau proteins throughout the brain. Recent studies have highlighted stark differences in how amyloid-beta and tau affect neurons at the cellular scale. On a larger scale, Alzheimer's patients are observed to undergo a period of early-stage neuronal hyperactivation followed by neurodegeneration and frequency-slowing of neuronal oscillations. Herein, we model the spreading of both amyloid-{beta} and tau across a human connectome and investigate how the neuronal dynamics are affected by disease progression. By including the effects of both amyloid-beta and tau pathology, we find that our model explains AD-related frequency slowing, early-stage hyperactivation, and late-stage hypoactivation. By testing different hypotheses, we show that hyperactivation and frequency-slowing are not due to the topological interactions between different regions but are mostly the result of local neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-beta and tau protein.

                The invention of the miniaturized microscope has enabled neuroscientists to investigate neural mechanisms in freely moving mice. A lot of efforts have been made to optimize performance of the miniaturized microscope. However, the tethered cables limit the ability of mini-microscope systems to record neural activity from multiple mice simultaneously. Here, we present a wireless mini-microscope (wScope) that enables both real-time remote control and data preview during animal behavior; this design also supports simultaneous recording from up to 8 mice. The wScope has a mass of 2.7 g and a maximum frame rate of 25 Hz at 750 m by 450 m field of view with 1.8 m resolution. We validated the wScopes in video-recording of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of different mice. The wScope provides a powerful tool for brain imaging of free moving animals, including large primates, in their much larger spaces and more naturalistic environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">(-)-Gossypol inhibition of musashi-mediated forgetting improves memory and age-dependent memory decline in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Musashi RNA-binding proteins retain a pivotal role in stem cell maintenance, tumorigenesis, and nervous system development. Recently, we showed in C. elegans that MSI1 actively promotes forgetting upon associative learning via modulation of cytoskeletal changes in the synapse. Here, we investigated the evolutionary conserved role of MSI proteins and the effect of their pharmacological inhibition on memory. Expression of human MSI1 and MSI2 under the endogenous musashi promoter fully rescued the phenotype of msi-1(lf) worms. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MSI1 and MSI2 activity using (-)-gossypol resulted in improved memory retention, without causing locomotor, chemotactic or learning deficits. No drug effect was observed in msi-1(lf) treated worms. Using Western blotting and confocal microscopy we found no changes in MSI-1 protein abundance following (-)-gossypol treatment, suggesting that musashi gene expression remains unaltered and that the compound exerts its inhibitory effect post-translationally. Additionally, (-)-gossypol suppressed the previously seen rescue of the msi-1(lf) phenotype in worms expressing human MSI1 specifically in the AVA neuron, indicating that (-)-gossypol can regulate the musashi pathway in a memory-related neuronal circuitry in worms. Finally, treating aged worms with (-)-gossypol reversed physiological age-dependent memory decline. Taken together, our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of musashi might represent a promising approach for memory modulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Purely STDP-based assembly dynamics: stability, learning, overlaps, drift and aging</a></h4>

              
                Memories may be encoded in the brain via strongly interconnected groups of neurons, called assemblies. The concept of Hebbian plasticity suggests that these assemblies are generated through synaptic plasticity, strengthening the recurrent connections within select groups of neurons that receive correlated stimulation. To remain stable in absence of such stimulation, the assemblies need to be self-reinforcing under the plasticity rule. Previous models of such assembly maintenance require additional mechanisms of fast homeostatic plasticity often with biologically implausible timescales. Here we provide a model of neuronal assembly generation and maintenance purely based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between excitatory neurons. It uses irregularly and stochastically spiking neurons and STDP that depresses connections of uncorrelated neurons. We find that assemblies do not grow beyond a certain size, because temporally imprecise spike correlations dominate the plasticity in large assemblies. Assemblies in the model can be learned or spontaneously emerge. The model allows for prominent, stable overlap structures between static assemblies. Further, assemblies can drift, particularly according to a novel, transient overlap-based mechanism. Finally the model indicates that assemblies grow in the aging brain, where connectivity decreases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theropod dinosaurs had primate-like numbers of telencephalic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neuronal composition of the brains of dinosaurs and other fossil amniotes would offer fundamental insight into their behavioral and cognitive capabilities, but brain tissue is not fossilized. However, when the bony brain case is preserved, the volume and therefore mass of the brain can be estimated with computer tomography; and if the scaling relationship between brain mass and numbers of neurons for the clade is known, that relationship can be applied to estimate the neuronal composition of the brain. Using a recently published database of numbers of neurons in the telencephalon of extant bird and non-avian reptiles, here I show that the neuronal scaling rules that apply to these animals can be used to infer the numbers of neurons that composed the telencephalon of dinosaur, pterosaur and other fossil reptile species, after using the relationship between brain and body mass to determine whether bird-like (endothermic) or non-avian reptile-like (ectothermic) rules apply to each fossil species. This procedure indicates that theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Allosaurus had monkey-like numbers of telencephalic neurons, which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition, and thus even more magnificent predators than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mammals, birds and non-avian reptiles have signature proportions of numbers of neurons across their brain structures: Numbers of neurons increased differently with endothermy in birds and mammals</a></h4>

              
                Modern mammals, birds, and non-avian reptiles have shared developmental and evolutionary origins in the ancestral amniotes of 300 million years ago. A previous analysis of a newly completed dataset on the cellular composition of the major parts of the brain of 242 amniote species, generated using the same cell counting method, the isotropic fractionator, argued for changes in the body-brain relationship in amniote evolution (Kverkova et al., 2022), but did not explore how the brains of amniotes diverged in their neuronal composition. Here I show, using the same dataset but focusing instead on the cellular composition of the brains regardless of body mass and phylogenetic relatedness, that the brains of extant mammalian, avian, and non-avian reptile species are characterized by signature proportions of numbers of neurons across the pallium, the cerebellum, and the rest of brain. An increase to a higher, fixed proportion of 4.5 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain, with variable numbers of pallial neurons, characterizes the avian brain compared to other reptiles, whereas mammalian brains are characterized by an average 4 neurons in the cerebellum to every neuron in the pallium regardless of numbers of neurons in the rest of brain, which also differs from the proportion in most non-avian reptilian brains of 1.4 neurons in the pallium and 0.5 neuron in the cerebellum to every neuron in the rest of brain. Thus, the independent evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals occurred with dramatic increases in numbers of neurons in all brain structures that differed markedly between birds and mammals. Additionally, there are marked continuities in the scaling of extant amniote brains that allow for the neuronal composition of the brain of ancestral amniotes to be estimated. Using these similarities in the neuronal scaling rules between living mammals and non-avian reptiles, I provide scaling relationships that allow predicting the composition of early mammaliaform and synapsid brains in amniote evolution, and I propose a simple model of amniote brain evolution that accounts for the diversity of modern mammalian, avian, and non-avian reptilian brains with only a few clade-shifting events in brain connectivity between cerebral cortex and cerebellum in mammals and between the cerebellum and rest of brain in birds, building on the increased availability of energy supply to the brain associated with the evolution of the increased oxidative and cardiovascular capacities that underlie endothermy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in the neural processing of reward feedback in young children</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence in school-aged children, adolescents, and adults suggests there are sex differences in the neural correlates of reward-based feedback processing. However, whether sex differences in neural processing of reward-based feedback are also present during early childhood has not been directly investigated. Understanding whether sex-related differences during neural processing of reward are present in young childhood has the potential to critically inform the etiology and prevention of psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulated reward processing. This study investigated potential sex-related differences in neural response to reward feedback and their association with emotional negativity in 140 children between 4-7 years of age. Children completed a developmentally appropriate reward processing task while electroencephalogram was recorded. Temporospatial Principal Component Analysis was used to separate overlapping ERP components, revealing that males had greater loss-related feedback negativity and gain- and loss-related P200 values than females. At an individual level, males also showed a negative correlation between emotional negativity scores and gain-related P200 amplitudes. These results suggest that sex-specific differences in the early development of neural reward processing are already present in young children.

                Psychophysical methods are widely used in neuroscience to investigate the quantitative relation between a physical property of the world and its perceptual representation provided by the senses. Recent studies introduced the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to fit the responses of multiple participants in psychophysical experiments. Another approach (two-level approach) requires fitting psychometric functions to each individual participant data using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and then testing the hypotheses on the multiple participants by means of a second level analysis. For either options, the implementation of the statistical analysis in R is possible and beneficial. Here, we introduce the package MixedPsy to model and fit psychometric data in R, either with two-level and GLMM approaches. The package, freely available in the CRAN repository, uses different methods for the estimation of Point of Subjective Equivalence (PSE) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND), and provides utilities for immediate visualization and plotting of the fitted results. This manuscript aims to provide researchers with a practical tutorial for implementing a complete analysis pipeline for psychophysical data using MixedPsy and other packages and basic functionalities of the R programming environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Light-sheet microscopy of network activity in 3D neuronal systems</a></h4>

              
                In vitro systems mimicking brain regions, such as brain organoids, are revolutionizing the field of neuroscience. However, characterization of their electrical activity has remained a challenge as this requires electrophysiological readout at millisecond timescale in 3D at single-neuron resolution. While custom-built microscopes used with genetically encoded sensors start to grant this access, a thorough 3D characterization of organoid neural activity has not been performed yet, limited by the combined complexity of the optical and the biological system. Here, we introduce a simple microscope for volumetric characterization of network activity with single-neuron resolution. To provide a versatile, accessible platform to the neuroscience community, we designed a minimalistic light-sheet microscope tai-lored to computational neuroscience tools to extract calcium traces. As a proof of principle, we created a 3D connectivity map of the neuronal network by imaging its spontaneous activity. High performance, low complexity setups such as ours will empower researchers to study the formation of neuronal networks in vitro for fundamental and neurodegeneration research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immediate and Long-Term Effects of Tibial Nerve Stimulation on the Sexual Behavior of Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: There are limited treatment options for female sexual dysfunction (FSD). Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) has shown improvements in FSD symptoms in neuromodulation clinical studies, but the direct effects on sexual function are not understood. This study evaluated the immediate and long-term effects of PTNS on sexual motivation and receptivity in a rat model of menopausal women. Our primary hypothesis was that long-term PTNS would yield greater changes in sexual behavior than short-term stimulation. Materials and Methods: In two Experiments, after receiving treatment, we placed ovariectomized female rats in an operant chamber apparatus with two compartments: a tethered, sexually active male was on one compartment and the female's access to the male's compartment was controlled by nose poking. We used five treatment conditions, which were with or without PTNS and no, partial, or full hormone priming. In Experiment 1, we rotated rats through each treatment condition twice with behavioral testing immediately following treatment for 10 weeks. In Experiment 2, we committed rats to one treatment condition for 6 weeks and sexual behavior was tracked over time. We quantified sexual motivation through number, latency, and frequency of nose pokes as well as completed intervals. We quantified sexual receptivity through mounts, lordosis quotient, and time spent in chamber areas. Results: No primary comparisons were significant in this study. In Experiment 1, we observed increased sexual motivation immediately following PTNS with hormones, but not receptivity. In Experiment 2, we observed trends of increased sexual receptivity and some sexual motivation metrics when PTNS was applied long-term with hormones. Conclusions: PTNS combined with hormone priming shows potential for increasing sexual motivation in the short-term and sexual receptivity in the long-term in rats. Further studies are needed to examine variability in rat behavior and to investigate PTNS as a treatment for FSD in menopausal women.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Obesogenic diet induces circuit-specific memory deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, including memory deficits. This is particularly worrisome during adolescence, which represents a crucial period for maturation of brain structures, such as the hippocampus which are crucial for cognition. In rodent models, we recently reported that memory impairments induced by obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) intake during the periadolescent period can be reversed by chemogenetic manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Here, we used an intersectional viral approach in HFD-fed male mice to chemogenetically inactivate specific vHPC efferent pathways to nucleus accumbens or medial prefrontal cortex during memory tasks. We first confirmed that HFD enhanced activation of both pathways after training and that our chemogenetic approach was effective in normalising this activation. Inactivation of the vHPC-nucleus accumbens pathway rescued HFD-induced deficits in recognition but not location memory. Conversely, inactivation of the vHPC-medial prefrontal cortex pathway restored location but not recognition memory impairments produced by HFD. Either pathway manipulation did not affect exploration, locomotion or anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that HFD intake throughout adolescence impairs different types of memory through overactivation of specific hippocampal efferent pathways and that targeting these overactive pathways has therapeutic potential.

                Autophagy is a self-eating intracellular degradation process in eukaryotic cell. Muti-pathways have been found can regulate autophagy activity through different mechanisms. In this study, we found that a nuclear abundant RNA binding protein, hnRNP R is involved in autophagy process by binding with ATG3, p62, Lamp1, LC3 and ATG9. On the other hand, hnRNP R also can regulate autophagy, we found depletion hnRNP R can activate the autophagy flux and activity. Furthermore, we also checked that autophagy has not connection with stress granules. This finding highlights some novel and nuclear located RNA binding proteins play important role in the regulation of autophagy activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateralization of orthographic processing in fixed-gaze and natural reading conditions</a></h4>

              
                Lateralized processing of orthographic information is a hallmark of proficient reading. However, how this finding obtained for fixed-gaze processing of orthographic stimuli translates to ecologically valid reading conditions remained to be clarified. To address this shortcoming, here we assessed the lateralization of early orthographic processing in fixed-gaze and natural reading conditions using concomitant eye-tracking and EEG data recorded from young adults without reading difficulties. Sensor-space analyses confirmed the well-known left-lateralized negative-going deflection of fixed-gaze EEG activity throughout the period of early orthographic processing. At the same time, fixation-related EEG activity exhibited left-lateralized followed by right-lateralized processing of text stimuli during natural reading. A strong positive relationship was found between the early leftward lateralization in fixed-gaze and natural reading conditions. Using source-space analyses, early left-lateralized brain activity was obtained in lateraloccipital and posterior ventral occipito-temporal cortices reflecting letter-level processing in both conditions. In addition, in the same time interval, left-lateralized source activity was found also in premotor and parietal brain regions during natural reading. While brain activity remained left-lateralized in later stages representing word-level processing in posterior and middle ventral temporal regions in the fixed-gaze condition, fixation-related source activity became stronger in the right hemisphere in medial and more anterior ventral temporal brain regions indicating higher-level processing of orthographic information. Although our results show a strong positive relationship between the lateralization of letter-level processing in the two conditions and suggest lateralized brain activity as a general marker for processing of orthographic information, they also clearly indicate the need for reading research in ecologically valid conditions to identify the neural basis of visuospatial attentional, oculomotor and higher-level processes specific for natural reading.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Autophagy degrades myelin proteins and is essential for maintaining CNS myelin homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                (Macro)autophagy comprises a major lysosome-dependent degradation mechanism which engulfs, removes and recycles unwanted cytoplasmic material, including damaged organelles and toxic protein aggregates. Although a few studies implicate autophagy in CNS demyelinating pathologies, its role, particularly in mature oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin, remains poorly studied. Here, using both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the autophagic machinery, we provide evidence that autophagy is an essential mechanism for oligodendrocyte maturation in vitro. Our study reveals that two core myelin proteins, namely proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) are incorporated into autophagosomes in oligodendrocytes, resulting in their degradation. Furthermore, we ablated atg5, a core gene of the autophagic machinery, specifically in myelinating glial cells in vivo by tamoxifen administration (plp-CreERT2; atg5F/F) at two distinct stages. Depletion of autophagy before the initiation of myelination does not impair the myelin status; however, myelin maintenance is perturbed upon autophagic ablation during adulthood, leading to PLP accumulation. Significant morphological defects in myelin membrane such as decompaction accompanied with increased axonal degeneration are observed. As a result, the mice exhibit behavioral deficits. In summary, our data highlight that the maintenance of adult myelin homeostasis in the CNS requires the involvement of a fully functional autophagic machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Denoising Approach Affects Diagnostic Differences in Brain Connectivity across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</a></h4>

              
                Graph theory provides a promising technique to investigate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related alterations in brain connectivity. However, discrepancies exist in the reported disruptions that occur to network topology across the AD continuum, which may be attributed to differences in the denoising approach used in fMRI processing to remove the effect of non-neuronal sources from signal. The current study aimed to determine if diagnostic differences in graph metrics were dependent on nuisance regression strategy. Sixty cognitively normal (CN), 60 MCI, and 40 AD matched for age, sex, and motion, were selected from the ADNI database for analysis. Resting state images were preprocessed using AFNI (v21.2.04) and 16 nuisance regression approaches were employed, which included the unique combination of four nuisance regressors (derivatives of the realignment parameters, motion censoring [euclidean norm > 0.3mm], outlier censoring [outlier fraction > .10], bandpass filtering [0.01 - 0.1 Hz]). Graph metrics representing network segregation (clustering coefficient, local efficiency, modularity), network integration (largest connected component, path length, local efficiency), and small-worldness (clustering coefficient/path length) were calculated. The results showed a significant interaction between diagnosis and nuisance approach on path length, such that diagnostic differences were only evident when motion derivatives and censoring of both motion and outlier volumes were applied. Further, regardless of the denoising approach, AD patients exhibited less segregated networks and lower small-worldness than CN and MCI. Finally, independent of diagnosis, denoising strategy significantly affected the magnitude of nearly all metrics (except local efficiency), such that models including bandpass filtering had higher graph metrics than those without. These findings suggest the relative robustness of network segregation and small-worldness properties to denoising strategy. However, caution should be taken when interpreting path length findings across studies, as subtle variations in regression approach may account for discrepancies. Continued efforts should be taken towards harmonizing preprocessing pipelines across studies to aid replication efforts and build consensus towards understanding the mechanisms underlying pathological aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing Multiple Algorithms to Calculate Brain Age: Examining Reliability, Relations with Demographics, and Predictive Power</a></h4>

              
                The calculation of so called "brain age" has been an emerging biomarker in aging research. Data suggests that discrepancies between chronological age and the predicted age of the brain may be predictive of mortality and morbidity (for review, see Cole, Marioni, Harris, & Deary, 2019). However, with these promising results come technical complexities of how to calculate brain age. Various groups have deployed methods leveraging different statistical approaches, often crafting novel algorithms for assessing this biomarker. There remain many open questions about the reliability, collinearity, and predictive power of different algorithms. Here, we complete a rigorous systematic comparison of three commonly used, previously published brain age algorithms (XGBoost, brainageR, and DeepBrainNet) to serve as a foundation for future applied research. First, using multiple datasets with repeated MRI scans, we calculated two metrics of reliability (intraclass correlations and Bland Altman bias). We then considered correlations between brain age variables, chronological age, biological sex, and image quality. We also calculated the magnitude of collinearity between approaches. Finally, we used canonical regression and machine learning approaches to identify significant predictors across brain age algorithms related to clinical diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease. Using a large sample (N=2557), we find all three commonly used brain age algorithms demonstrate excellent reliability (r>.9). We also note that brainageR and DeepBrainNet are reasonably correlated with one another, and that the XGBoost brain age is strongly related to image quality. Finally, and notably, we find that XGBoost brain age calculations were more sensitive to the detection of clinical diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease. We close this work with recommendations for future research studies focused on brain age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A universal pipeline for the alignment of electrode tracks with slice histology and electrophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                Modern electrophysiological experiments in neuroscience typically measure the activity of hundreds of neurons across multiple brain regions. Each recorded neuron has to be assigned its correct area of origin, which can be estimated using histological reconstructions of electrode tracks. However, this approach has a limited accuracy with which the probe position can be determined. While some tools exist to assist in this process in mice, such tools are scarce for other species, such as rats or macaques. Moreover, even in mice, a more reliable brain area assignment may be achieved by using spiking response properties to delineate area boundaries along the recording probe. Here we present the Universal Probe Finder, which provides multi-species support for reconstructing a probe's brain area per spike-sorted cluster or recording site. It can use various data formats and can calculate neuronal responsiveness to experimental interventions with only event times and spike times to provide further neurophysiological markers that simplify and improve the reliability of assigning brain areas to neurons. The program can be downloaded here: https://github.com/JorritMontijn/UniversalProbeFinder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced emergent character of neural dynamics in patients with a disrupted connectome</a></h4>

              
                High-level brain functions are widely believed to emerge from the orchestrated activity of multiple neural systems. However, lacking a formal definition and practical quantification of emergence for experimental data, neuroscientists have been unable to empirically test this long-standing conjecture. Here we investigate this fundamental question by leveraging a recently proposed framework known as Integrated Information Decomposition, which establishes a principled information-theoretic approach to operationalise and quantify emergence in dynamical systems, including the human brain. By analysing functional MRI data, our results show that the emergent and hierarchical character of neural dynamics is significantly diminished in chronically unresponsive patients suffering from severe brain injury. At a functional level, we demonstrate that emergence capacity is positively correlated with the extent of hierarchical organisation in brain activity. Furthermore, by combining computational approaches from network control theory and whole-brain biophysical modelling, we show that the reduced capacity for emergent and hierarchical dynamics in severely brain-injured patients can be mechanistically explained by disruptions in the patients' structural connectome. Overall, our results suggest that chronic unresponsiveness resulting from severe brain injury may be due to structural impairment of the fundamental neural infrastructures required for brain dynamics to support emergence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distraction and cognitive control independently impact parietal and prefrontal neural response to pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain engages and interacts with high-level cognitive processing. Previous studies documented that distracting someone through a challenging activity leads to hypoalgesia, an effect held to be mediated by parietal and prefrontal structures, who monitor pain-evoked neural response and maintain attention towards task-relevant events. Instead, alternative accounts suggest that challenging activities affect the ability to regulate one's aching experiences, due to partially-common neural substrate between cognitive control and pain at the level the medial prefrontal cortex, which could lead to hyperalgesic after-effects. Here we pulled apart effects of distraction and cognitive control on pain by delivering thermal painful stimulations either During or After (factor TIME) the engagement of a interfering Stroop paradigm (requiring high cognitive control) or a neutral condition (factor TASK). We found that TIME influenced individual assessment of pain, with less intense ratings associated to the During condition. This hypoalgesia was associated with increased activity at the level of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex, in interaction with the insular cortex. This was complemented by multivariate pattern analysis who revealed that distraction altered the neural response to pain, by making it more similar to that associated with previous Stroop tasks. Critically, all these effects were observed independently of the nature of the TASK employed which, instead, led to a localized neural modulation at the level of anterior cingulate cortex. Overall, our study underscores the role played by two different faces of human executive functions, which exert independent influence in the neural response evoked by thermal pain.

	<p>Misconceptions about the brain (neuromyths) among educators have been found across different countries, but little has been done to dispel them. The present study assessed the effect of a one-year Science of Learning (SoL) course on neuroscience literacy and beliefs in neuromyths in a sample of Chilean pre-service teachers. An experimental group of pre-service teachers, who took the SoL course as part of their university training, and a control group were needed for the study. Participants in both groups completed an online survey three times during the year (beginning, middle and end of year). The results showed that participants in both groups responded correctly to most assertions but held major misconceptions about the brain (Time 1), in line with previous studies. Regarding neuroscience literacy, participants in the experimental and control groups did not differ significantly at Time 1, but the experimental group showed significantly better performance than the control group at Time 2 and Time 3. Unlike neuroscience literacy, the results in neuromyth beliefs did not differ significantly by group at Time 1 and Time 2; however, at Time 3, the experimental group showed a significant decline in neuromyth beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that the SoL course significantly improved overall neuroscience literacy and reduced neuromyth belief among pre-service teachers, but the effect of the intervention was small.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health outcomes – A cross-sectional study among health care workers in Coastal South India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Al-Najaf governate, Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is one of the most global dangerous infectious diseases worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most infectious agent that caused PTB transferred by air droplets from one person to other. In the present epidemiological study, we aimed to record the total numbers and percentages of patients infected with PTB caused by Mtb during 12 months in AL-Najaf Governorate, Iraq.    Methods: This study has been done in 2019 from January to the end of December in the north and south region of AL-Najaf Governorate, Iraq. Sputum of PTB-patients has been stained by Ziehl–Neelsen to Mtb diagnosis according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. Results: We recorded 174 PTB-patients in AL-Najaf Governorate 2019; 89 male and 85 female; 101 and 73 in the north and south sections respectively. The age group 16-24 was the highest infected. Quarter two recorded the highest numbers of PTB-patients; 33 (60%) in the north section and 22 (40%) in the south section. Conclusion: There was low PTB incidence in AL-Najaf Governorate 2019 but the Youngers were the most susceptible to infection. Infection in the north section was higher than in the south section and there were no high differences between genders. Seasons have no high effect on the number of infections.

                Background: The evidence on harms and benefits of e-cigarettes partly concerns whether their use encourages smokers to quit.  We addressed this using data from the nationally representative PATH study, with detailed accounting for potential confounding variables. Methods: We considered adults aged 25+.  Our original analyses, reported in version 1 of this paper, used data for Waves 1 to 3, separate analyses considering Waves 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 1 to 3.  These related baseline ever e-cigarette use (or e-product use at Wave 2) to quitting at follow-up, adjusting for confounders derived from 55 candidates.  Sensitivity analyses omitted ever other product users, linked quitting to current e-cigarette use, and used values of some predictors modified using follow-up data.  Additional analyses used data for Waves 1 to 4, separately considering sustained, delayed and temporary quitting during Waves 1 to 3, 2 to 4 and 1 to 4.  Sensitivity analyses considered 30-day quitting, restricted attention to smokers attempting to quit, and considered ever smokeless tobacco or snus use. Results: In the original analyses, unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of quitting smoking for ever e-cigarette use were 1.29 (95% CI 1.01-1.66), 1.52 (1.26-1.83) and 1.47 (1.19-1.82) for the Wave 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3 analyses.  These reduced after adjustment, to 1.23 (0.94-1.61), 1.51 (1.24-1.85) and 1.39 (1.11-1.74).  Quitting rates remained elevated in users in all sensitivity analyses.  The additional analyses found associations of e-cigarette use with sustained, delayed and temporary quitting, associations little affected by considering 30-day quitting, and only slightly reduced restricting attention to quit attempters.  Ever use of smokeless tobacco or snus also predicted increased quitting.   Conclusions: As does most evidence from clinical trials, other analyses of PATH, and other epidemiological studies, our results suggest using e-cigarettes helps adult smokers to quit.

                Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions: Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Consumption of food supplements: is there a risk of muscle dysmorphia? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Bigorexia is an eating disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder where the subject has an incorrect perception of their body image with exercise addiction. This study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between body mass index (BMI), food supplement consumption, dietary adherence, gender and risk of muscle dysmorphia in the individual and to provide information to build recommendation systems to monitor the health and mental state of the population. Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was conducted in Barranquilla (Colombia) between February – May 2020. A face-to-face survey of 200 individuals of both sexes was used in which users evaluated different variables that helped to identify their risk of muscle dysmorphia.   Results. Of the 200 participants, 105 men: N=48, 45.7% vs. women: N=57, 54.3%) consume nutritional supplements. There is no relationship in the total population with the risk of muscle dysmorphia with the consumption of nutritional supplements nor with the feeling of guilt for non-adherence to the diet, nor with age, gender, or BMI (p<0.05). In contrast, gender, age and BMI are related to nutritional supplement consumption, and gender is related to feelings of guilt for non-adherence to the diet. In the population that consumes nutritional supplements the risk of muscle dysmorphia is increased and the frequency varies by risk group: low risk: N=16, 15.2%; medium risk: N=46, 43.8%; high risk: N=28, 26.7%; and very high risk: N=15, 14.3%. The consumption of food supplements is higher in the female gender (57, 54.3% vs. 48, 45.7%), and moderate the feeling of guilt for not completing the diet, BMI and the risk of muscle dysmorphia. Conclusions.  Women consume more food supplements, but gender does not determine the risk of muscle dysmorphia. Food supplement consumption influences the feeling of guilt for not completing the diet, BMI and the risk of muscle dysmorphia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain death debates: from bioethics to philosophy of science [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                50 years after its introduction, brain death remains controversial among scholars. The debates focus on one question: is brain death a good criterion for determining death? This question has been answered from various perspectives: medical, metaphysical, ethical, and legal or political. Most authors either defend the criterion as it is, propose some minor or major revisions, or advocate abandoning it and finding better solutions to the problems that brain death was intended to solve when it was introduced. Here I plead for a different approach that has been overlooked in the literature: the philosophy of science approach. Some scholars claim that human death is a matter of fact, a biological phenomenon whose occurrence can be determined empirically, based on science. We should take this claim seriously, whether we agree with it or not. The question is: how do we know that human death is a scientific matter of fact? Taking the philosophy of science approach means, among other things, examining how the determination of human death became an object of scientific inquiry, exploring the nature of the brain death criterion itself, and analysing the meaning of its core concepts such as “irreversibility” and “functions”.

                Monday, Kharod et al. report that neuronal activity regulates presynaptic FMRP function and the local synthesis of β-actin. In vitro activity and in vivo experience engage the FMRP-dependent spatiotemporal regulation of protein synthesis that is required for presynaptic remodeling and long-term changes in neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A native chemical chaperone in the human eye lens</a></h4>

              
                Cataract is one of the most prevalent protein aggregation disorders and still the most common cause of vision loss worldwide. The metabolically quiescent core region of the human lens lacks cellular or protein turnover; it has therefore evolved remarkable mechanisms to resist light-scattering protein aggregation for a lifetime. We now report that one such mechanism involves an unusually abundant lens metabolite, <i>myo-</i>inositol, suppressing aggregation of lens crystallins. We quantified aggregation suppression using our previously well-characterized <i>in vitro</i> aggregation assays of oxidation-mimicking human γD-crystallin variants and investigated <i>myo-</i>inositol's molecular mechanism of action using solution NMR, negative-stain TEM, differential scanning fluorometry, thermal scanning Raman spectroscopy, turbidimetry in redox buffers, and free thiol quantitation. Unlike many known chemical chaperones, myo-inositol's primary target was not the native, unfolded, or final aggregated states of the protein; rather, we propose that it was the rate-limiting bimolecular step on the aggregation pathway. Given recent metabolomic evidence that it is severely depleted in human cataractous lenses compared to age-matched controls, we suggest that maintaining or restoring healthy levels of <i>myo-</i>inositol in the lens may be a simple, safe, and globally accessible strategy to prevent or delay lens opacification due to age-onset cataract.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive fitness landscape of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reveals insights into viral resistance mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                With the continual evolution of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that are more virulent, transmissible, and able to evade current vaccines, there is an urgent need for effective anti-viral drugs SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is a leading target for drug design due to its conserved and indispensable role in the viral life cycle. Drugs targeting M<sup>pro</sup> appear promising but will elicit selection pressure for resistance. To understand resistance potential in M<sup>pro</sup>, we performed a comprehensive mutational scan of the protease that analyzed the function of all possible single amino acid changes. We developed three separate high-throughput assays of M<sup>pro</sup> function in yeast, based on either the ability of M<sup>pro</sup> variants to cleave at a defined cut-site or on the toxicity of their expression to yeast. We used deep sequencing to quantify the functional effects of each variant in each screen. The protein fitness landscapes from all three screens were strongly correlated, indicating that they captured the biophysical properties critical to M<sup>pro</sup> function. The fitness landscapes revealed a non-active site location on the surface that is extremely sensitive to mutation making it a favorable location to target with inhibitors. In addition, we found a network of critical amino acids that physically bridge the two active sites of the M<sup>pro</sup> dimer. The clinical variants of M<sup>pro</sup> were predominantly functional in our screens, indicating that M<sup>pro</sup> is under strong selection pressure in the human population. Our results provide predictions of mutations that will be readily accessible to M<sup>pro</sup> evolution and that are likely to contribute to drug resistance. This complete mutational guide of M<sup>pro</sup> can be used in the design of inhibitors with reduced potential of evolving viral resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sequential addition of neuronal stem cell temporal cohorts generates a feed-forward circuit in the Drosophila larval nerve cord</a></h4>

              
                How circuits self-assemble starting from neuronal stem cells is a fundamental question in developmental neurobiology. Here, we addressed how neurons from different stem cell lineages wire with each other to form a specific circuit motif. In Drosophila larvae, we combined developmental genetics (Twin spot MARCM, Multi-color Flip Out, permanent labeling) with circuit analysis (calcium imaging, connectomics, network science). For many lineages, neuronal progeny are organized into subunits called temporal cohorts. Temporal cohorts are subsets of neurons born within a tight time window that have shared circuit level function. We find sharp transitions in patterns of input connectivity at temporal cohort boundaries. In addition, we identify a feed-forward circuit that encodes the onset of vibration stimuli. This feed-forward circuit is assembled by preferential connectivity between temporal cohorts from different lineages. Connectivity does not follow the often-cited early-to-early, late-to-late model. Instead, the circuit is formed by sequential addition of temporal cohorts from different lineages, with circuit output neurons born before circuit input neurons. Further, we generate new tools for the fly community. Our data raise the possibility that sequential addition of neurons (with outputs oldest and inputs youngest) could be one fundamental strategy for assembling feed-forward circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NAD kinase promotes Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis by supporting production of virulence factors and protective enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the primary electron donor for reductive reactions that are essential for the biosynthesis of major cell components in all organisms. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (NADK) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NADP(H) from NAD(H). While the enzymatic properties and physiological functions of NADK have been thoroughly studied, the role of NADK in bacterial pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we used CRISPR interference to knock down NADK gene expression to address the role of this enzyme in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> pathogenic potential. We find that NADK inhibition drastically decreases mortality of zebrafish infected with <i>S. aureus</i>. Furthermore, we show that NADK promotes <i>S. aureus</i> survival in infected macrophages by protecting bacteria from antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Proteome-wide data analysis revealed that production of major virulence-associated factors is sustained by NADK. We demonstrate that NADK is required for expression of the quorum-sensing response regulator AgrA, which controls critical <i>S. aureus</i> virulence determinants. These findings support a key role for NADK in bacteria survival within innate immune cells and the host during infection.

                Herbicides with novel modes of action are urgently needed to safeguard global agricultural industries against the damaging effects of herbicide-resistant weeds. We recently developed the first herbicidal inhibitors of lysine biosynthesis, which provided proof-of-concept for a promising novel herbicide target. In this study, we expanded upon our understanding of the mode of action of herbicidal lysine biosynthesis inhibitors. We previously postulated that these inhibitors may act as proherbicides. Here, we show this is not the case. We report an additional mode of action of these inhibitors, through their inhibition of a second lysine biosynthesis enzyme, and investigate the molecular determinants of inhibition. Furthermore, we extend our herbicidal activity analyses to include a weed species of global significance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning accurate path integration in ring attractor models of the head direction system</a></h4>

              
                Ring attractor models for angular path integration have received strong experimental support. To function as integrators, head direction circuits require precisely tuned connectivity, but it is currently unknown how such tuning could be achieved. Here, we propose a network model in which a local, biologically plausible learning rule adjusts synaptic efficacies during development, guided by supervisory allothetic cues. Applied to the Drosophila head direction system, the model learns to path-integrate accurately and develops a connectivity strikingly similar to the one reported in experiments. The mature network is a quasi-continuous attractor and reproduces key experiments in which optogenetic stimulation controls the internal representation of heading, and where the network remaps to integrate with different gains in rodents. Our model predicts that path integration requires self-supervised learning during a developmental phase, and proposes a general framework to learn to path-integrate with gain-1 even in architectures that lack the physical topography of a ring.

                Understanding circuit-level manipulations that affect the brain's capacity for plasticity will inform the design of targeted interventions that enhance recovery after stroke. Following stroke, increased contralesional activity (e.g. use of the unaffected limb) can negatively influence recovery, but it is unknown which specific neural connections exert this influence, and to what extent increased contralesional activity affects systems- and molecular-level biomarkers of recovery. Here, we combine optogenetic photostimulation with optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) to examine how contralesional excitatory activity affects cortical remodeling after stroke in mice. Following photothrombosis of left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex, mice either recovered spontaneously or received chronic optogenetic excitation of right S1FP over the course of 4 weeks. Contralesional excitation suppressed perilesional S1FP remapping and was associated with abnormal patterns of stimulus-evoked activity in the unaffected limb. This maneuver also prevented the restoration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the S1FP network, RSFC in several networks functionally-distinct from somatomotor regions, and resulted in persistent limb-use asymmetry. In stimulated mice, perilesional tissue exhibited transcriptional changes in several genes relevant for recovery. Our results suggest that contralesional excitation impedes local and global circuit reconnection through suppression of cortical activity and several neuroplasticity-related genes after stroke, and highlight the importance of site selection for therapeutic intervention after focal ischemia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The role of surface adhesion on the macroscopic wrinkling of biofilms</a></h4>

              
                Biofilms, bacterial communities of cells encased by a self-produced matrix, exhibit a variety of three-dimensional structures. Specifically, channel networks formed within the bulk of the biofilm have been identified to play an important role in the colonies' viability by promoting the transport of nutrients and chemicals. Here, we study channel formation and focus on the role of the adhesion of the biofilm matrix to the substrate in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> biofilms grown under constant flow in microfluidic channels. We perform phase contrast and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the development of the biofilm structure as a function of the substrates' surface energy. The formation of the wrinkles and folds is triggered by a mechanical buckling instability, controlled by biofilm growth rate and the film’s adhesion to the substrate. The three-dimensional folding gives rise to hollow channels that rapidly increase the effective volume occupied by the biofilm and facilitate bacterial movement inside them. The experiments and analysis on mechanical instabilities for the relevant case of a bacterial biofilm grown during flow enable us to predict and control the biofilm morphology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An expanded toolkit for Drosophila gene tagging using synthesized homology donor constructs for CRISPR mediated homologous recombination</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we described a large collection of Drosophila strains that each carry an artificial exon containing a <i>T2AGAL4</i> cassette inserted in an intron of a target gene based on CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination (Lee <i>et al</i>., 2018). These alleles permit numerous applications and have proven to be very useful. Initially, the homologous recombination-based donor constructs had long homology arms (&gt;500 bps) to promote precise integration of large constructs (&gt;5kb). Recently, we showed that <i>in vivo</i> linearization of the donor constructs enables insertion of large artificial exons in introns using short homology arms (100-200 bps) (Kanca <i>et al</i>., 2019a). Shorter homology arms make it feasible to commercially synthesize homology donors and minimize the cloning steps for donor construct generation. Unfortunately, about 58% of Drosophila genes lack a suitable coding intron for integration of artificial exons in all of the annotated isoforms. Here, we report the development of new set of constructs that allow the replacement of the coding region of genes that lack suitable introns with a <i>KozakGAL4</i> cassette, generating a knock-out/knock-in allele that expresses GAL4 similarly as the targeted gene. We also developed custom vector backbones to further facilitate and improve transgenesis. Synthesis of homology donor constructs in custom plasmid backbones that contain the target gene sgRNA obviates the need to inject a separate sgRNA plasmid and significantly increases the transgenesis efficiency. These upgrades will enable the targeting of nearly every fly gene, regardless of exon-intron structure, with a 70-80% success rate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pregabalin silences oxaliplatin-activated sensory neurons to relieve cold allodynia</a></h4>

              
                Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent that causes cold and mechanical allodynia in up to 90% of patients. Silent NaV1.8-positive nociceptive cold sensors have been shown to be unmasked by oxaliplatin and other neuropathic insults. This event has been causally linked to the development of cold and mechanical allodynia. Pregabalin is an anti-epileptic and analgesic drug that acts through a calcium channel 2{delta}-1 subunit to lower neurotransmitter release. Recent data also suggest pregabalin can act on NMDA receptors and other proteins, but the site of analgesic action has been considered to be the central nervous system. We examined the effects of pregabalin on oxaliplatin-evoked unmasking of cold sensitive neurons using mice expressing GCaMP-3 driven by a Pirt promoter in all sensory neurons. We found that in mice treated with oxaliplatin, intravenous injection of pregabalin significantly decreased cold allodynia. Interestingly, pregabalin also decreased the number of sensory neurons responding to cold nociceptive stimuli by altering their excitability and their temperature thresholds. These silenced neurons are medium/large cells responding to both painful mechanical and cold stimuli, corresponding to the 'silent' cold sensors that become active in numerous neuropathic pain models. Deletion of 2{delta}-1 subunits abolished the effects of pregabalin on both cold allodynia and the silencing of sensory neuron unmasked by oxaliplatin. Taken together, these results define a novel, peripheral inhibitory effect of pregabalin on the excitability of silent cold-sensing neurons in a model of oxaliplatin-dependent cold allodynia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis of pre-symptomatic Drosophila models for ALS and SMA reveals convergent impact on functional protein complexes linked to neuro-muscular degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis share both phenotypic and molecular commonalities, including the fact that they can be caused by mutations in proteins involved in RNA metabolism, namely Smn, TDP-43 and Fus. Although this suggests the existence of common disease mechanisms, there is currently no model to explain the converging motoneuron dysfunction caused by changes in the expression of these ubiquitous genes. In this work we generated a parallel set of Drosophila models for adult-onset RNAi and tagged neuronal expression of the orthologues of SMN1, TARDBP and FUS (Smn, TBPH and Caz, respectively). We profiled nuclear and cytoplasmic bound mRNAs using a RIP-seq approach and characterized the transcriptome of the RNAi models by RNA-seq. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the common functional impact of these proteins on neuronal cells, we devised a computational approach based on the construction of a tissue-specific library of protein functional modules, selected by an overall impact score measuring the estimated extent of perturbation caused by each gene knockdown. Our integrative approach revealed that although each disease-associated gene regulates a poorly overlapping set of transcripts, they have a concerted effect on a specific subset of protein functional modules, acting through distinct targets. Most strikingly, functional annotation reveals these modules to be involved in critical cellular pathways for neurons and in particular, in neuromuscular junction function. Furthermore, selected modules were found to be significantly enriched in orthologues of human genes linked to neuronal disease. This work provides a new model explaining how mutations in SMA and ALS-associated disease genes linked to RNA metabolism functionally converge to cause motoneuron dysfunction. The critical functional modules identified represent interesting biomarkers and therapeutic targets given their identification in asymptomatic disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chrna5 is a marker of acetylcholine super-responder subplate neurons with specialized expression of nicotinic modulator proteins</a></h4>

              
                Attention depends on cholinergic excitation of prefrontal neurons. Knockout/knockdown studies indicate nicotinic alpha5 subunits encoded by Chrna5 are required for this response, but their native cellular roles and molecular interactions are unknown. Here, we probe endogenous cholinergic regulation of prefrontal Chrna5-expressing neurons (Chrna5+) using compound transgenic mice. Chrna5+ neurons show high sensitivity to acetylcholine, with a subpopulation clearly different from nearby, well-examined Syt6+ cells. Transcriptomic analysis reveals this distinct Chrna5+ population as subplate neurons, a diverse group of firstborn cells that have eluded previous transgenic characterization. Intriguingly, Chrna5+ subplate neurons express a distinct profile of GPI-anchored lynx prototoxins, suggesting specialized regulation of their cholinergic responses. In brain slices, endogenous nicotinic responses can be bidirectionally altered by perturbing GPI-anchored lynxes with phospholipase C activation or exogenous application of recombinant Ly6g6e prototoxin. Our work reveals cell-type specific Chrna5 and Lynx modulation leading to exquisite cholinergic sensitivity of prefrontal subplate neurons in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alterations of auditory sensory gating in mice with noise-induced tinnitus treated with nicotine and cannabis extract</a></h4>

              
                Aims/Hypothesis: Tinnitus is a phantom sound perception affecting both auditory and limbic structures. The mechanisms of tinnitus remain unclear and it is debatable whether tinnitus alters attention to sound and the ability to inhibit repetitive sounds, a phenomenon also known as auditory gating. Methods: 22 male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Anesthetized mice were exposed to a 9-11 kHz narrow band noise (90 dBSPL for 1 hr) and sham exposed mice were used as controls. Hearing thresholds were measured using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and tinnitus was assessed using Gap prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle (GPIAS). After the induction of tinnitus, mice were implanted multi-electrodes to assess auditory event-related potentials (aERPs) in the dorsal hippocampus in response to paired clicks. Alterations of aERPs under nicotine (1.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) or cannabis extract (100 mg/Kg, i.p.) were evaluated (in isolation or in combination), the latter containing 47.25 mg/kg of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); 0.43 mg/kg of cannabidiol (CBD) and 1.17 mg/kg of cannabinol (CBN), as analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Saline-treated animals were used as controls. Results: Our results show that mice with behavioral evidence of tinnitus display auditory gating of repetitive click, but with larger amplitudes and longer latencies of the N40 component. In contrast, no difference was observed in the P80 amplitude and latency between groups or treatments. The combination of cannabis extract and nicotine also improved auditory gating ratio in mice with noise-induced tinnitus without permanent hearing threshold shifts by strongly increasing the first N40 click amplitude but without altering the second click response amplitude. Furthermore, the increased latency of the N40 component suggests altered temporal processing of triggered attention in mice with tinnitus due to an increased sensitivity to the exposure to cannabis extract. Conclusion/Interpretation: In summary, we show that nicotine and cannabis extract alter sensory gating in mice with behavioral evidence of tinnitus and propose that the altered central plasticity in tinnitus is more sensitive to the combined actions on the cholinergic and the endocannabinoid systems. We conclude that the limbic system may play a role in the altered sensory gating responses on tinnitus since the hippocampus responses to auditory inputs are altered. These findings could enable a new understanding of which neuronal pathways could be involved in sensory gating in tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human concurrent intracranial EEG and fMRI reveals multiple temporally independent but spatially similar connectome trajectories across timescales</a></h4>

              
                The large-scale organization of functional connectivity (FC) - the functional connectome - traverses distinct spatial patterns in a dynamic trajectory as demonstrated independently in fMRI and electrophysiological studies. These patterns are thought to satisfy ever-changing processing demands. FMRI and electrophysiology capture partly non-overlapping neural populations at different timescales, and it remains unknown to what degree the dynamic connectome trajectories across the two modalities are associated. We sought to clarify this relationship by studying resting wakefulness in a rare concurrent intracranial EEG and functional MRI dataset (iEEG-fMRI; 9 human neurosurgical patients) and in whole-brain connectomes obtained from source-localized EEG-fMRI (26 healthy humans). We measured ''spatial convergence'' as cross-modal spatial similarity of connectome configurations at a given time, and ''temporal convergence'' as synchronous occurrence of spatial convergence. We investigated three possible scenarios characterizing the cross-modal association of connectome trajectories: I) spatially and temporally convergent, II) spatially convergent but temporally divergent, and III) spatially and temporally divergent. We found that the behavior of fMRI and iEEG/EEG is consistent with scenario II: connectome trajectories spatially converge at intermittent times. Importantly, such asynchronous spatial convergence of connectome configurations was driven by cross-modally matched recurrent connectome states, independently across electrophysiological timescales. This connectome-level multi-frequency spatial convergence and temporal divergence suggests that hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals capture distinct aspects of FC, rather than serving as intermodal measurements of the same phenomenon. The multitude of flexible trajectories across timescales may concurrently enable FC across multiple independent sets of distributed brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BOSS: Beta-mixture Unsupervised Oligodendrocytes Segmentation System</a></h4>

              
                To develop reparative therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), we need to better understand the physiology of loss and replacement of oligodendrocytes, the cells that make myelin and the target of damage in MS. In vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy allows direct visualization of oligodendrocytes in transgenic mouse models, and promises a deeper understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of replacing oligodendrocytes after damage. However, the task of tracking oligodendrocytes requires extensive human effort and is especially challenging in three-dimensional images. While several models exist for automatically annotating cells in two-dimensional images, few models exist to annotate cells in three-dimensional images and even fewer are designed for tracking cells in longitudinal imaging. Furthermore, the complexity of processes and myelin formed by individual oligodendrocytes can result in the failure of algorithms that are specifically designed for tracking cell bodies alone. Here, we propose a novel beta-mixture unsupervised oligodendrocyte segmentation system (BOSS) that can segment and track oligodendrocytes in three-dimensional images over time that requires minimal human input. We evaluated the performance of the BOSS model on a set of eight images obtained longitudinally. We showed that the BOSS model can segment and track oligodendrocytes similarly to a blinded human observer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normalization of MRI T1w between-scan effects for improved longitudinal volumetric estimates</a></h4>

              
                Variations in image intensities and contrasts between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions affect the subsequent image processing and its derived outcomes. Therefore, comparability between acquisitions is improved if we reduce these variations. This is especially relevant for longitudinal studies where a change of scanner or acquisition protocol often happens between subsequent examinations. In this study, we use a robust intensity distribution alignment (RIDA) method to reduce between-scan effects and improve longitudinal volume change estimates between two MRI scanners - Siemens 1.5T Avanto and 3T Skyra. The method is based on MRI T1w images acquired in close succession and robustly aligns two cumulative distribution functions of voxel intensities to harmonize image intensities and improve image-derived outcomes of a range of subcortical brain. We compare RIDA with volume-based correction - a simple linear regression model. In both cases, we derive intensity and volume transformations from a training dataset of 20 participants scanned on both scanners on the same day and apply to an independent longitudinal test dataset of 243 participants. All participants in the test set were scanned at the Avanto scanner at the baseline and then at the Avanto and Skyra scanners on the same day at the follow-up, on average 4.4 years (sd = 0.5 years) later. This allowed us to directly assess the effect of scanner and protocol change on the longitudinal change estimates. Eight subcortical brain regions were segmented using SAMSEG, and annualized symmetrized percent change in volume between time points was calculated. We find that RIDA significantly reduces between-scan effects and improves longitudinal volume estimates for the amygdala and lateral ventricles. It also reduces between-scan effects for caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not as much as linear regression models. Whether the method will be useful for a particular study will depend on the image intensity profiles of the scans. Therefore, a pilot study of double-scanned participants is recommended to assess the advantages of the method for the analysis in question.

                As prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, are projected to more than double by 2050, emphasis has been placed on early intervention strategies that target resilience mechanisms to delay or prevent the onset of clinical symptoms. Several neural mechanisms underlying brain resilience to AD have been proposed, including redundant neural connections between the posterior hippocampi (HC) and all other brain regions, and global functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex (LFC). It remains unknown, however, if regional redundancy of the HC and LFC underscores neural resilience in the presence of AD pathologies. From the ADNI database, 363 cognitively normal older adults (CN) (N = 220; 36% A{beta}) and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (N = 143; 51% A{beta}) were utilized. Regional redundancy was calculated from resting state fMRI data using a graph theoretical approach by summing the direct and indirect paths (path lengths=1-4) between each ROI and its 262 functional connections. The results showed that A{beta}-status significantly disrupted posterior HC, but not anterior HC or LFC, redundancy. A{beta} groups showed higher redundancy of the bilateral posterior HC than A{beta}. In regard to redundancy-cognition relationships, higher posterior HC redundancy was related to better episodic memory performance, an effect which was primarily driven by the A{beta} group. Despite the positive relationship between posterior HC redundancy and cognition, we did not find compelling evidence that redundancy of the posterior HC serves in a resilience manner, as posterior HC redundancy did not moderate the potentially deleterious relationship between A{beta} deposition and cognition. No relationships were found between anterior HC or LFC redundancy and cognitive performance. Together, these findings suggest that redundancy of the LFC does not underpin its role in resilience and that posterior HC redundancy may capture disruptions to network connectivity that occur as a result of A{beta} deposition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical dynamics following real-time MEG neurofeedback training of the speed of shifting spatial attention: a pilot study</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback is a technique that directs self-regulated modulation of neural activity. This is achieved by delivering real-time feedback derived from brain signals. In our previous work, we introduced a novel method, state-based neurofeedback (sb-NFB) that targets patterns of MEG signals related to shifts in spatial attention. In this pilot study, we used sb-NFB to train participants to decrease the time required to covertly shift spatial attention from one visual hemifield to the other. We characterized the changes to cortical connectivity during each training session. In addition, we run a separate, Posner-like validation task before the training sessions and after the training was complete. We found a significant main effect of training on the reaction time linked to switching spatial attention in both the training task and the validation task. This indicates the achieved improvement in shifting spatial attention generalized to another situation requiring this capability.

                Responses of auditory cortex neurons are modulated by spectral or temporal context, but much less is known about modulation by spatial context. Here, we investigated single neuron responses to sequences of sounds either repeatedly delivered from a single spatial location or randomly delivered from multiple spatial locations in the auditory cortex of awake marmosets. Instead of inducing adaptation as expected from well-documented stimulus-specific adaptation studies, repetitive stimulation from a target speaker evoked long-lasting, location-specific facilitation (LSF) in many neurons, irrespective of the visibility of the target speaker. The extent of LSF decreased with decreasing presentation probability of the target speaker. Intracellular recordings showed that repetitive sound stimulation evoked sustained membrane potential depolarization which gave rise to firing rate facilitation. Computational models suggest two distinct neural mechanisms underlying LSF. Our findings revealed a novel form of contextual modulation in the auditory cortex that may play a role in auditory stream segregation.

                Human cognition is characterized by a wide range of capabilities including goal-oriented selective attention, distractor suppression, decision making, response inhibition, and working memory. Much research has focused on studying these individual components of cognition in isolation, whereas in several translational applications for cognitive impairment, multiple cognitive functions are altered in a given individual. Hence it is important to study multiple cognitive abilities in the same subject or, in computational terms, model them using a single model. To this end, we propose a unified, reinforcement learning-based agent model comprising of systems for representation, memory, value computation and exploration. We successfully modelled the aforementioned cognitive tasks and show how individual performance can be mapped to model meta-parameters. This model has the potential to serve as a proxy for cognitively impaired conditions, and can be used as a clinical testbench on which therapeutic interventions can be simulated first before delivering to human subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A non-lemniscal thalamic interface connecting alerting sensory cues to internal states in mice</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in internal states, such as elevated arousal level and increased anxiety or fear, triggered by alerting environmental cues are required for behavioral state transitions promoting survival. However, the specific brain region that plays an interfacing role between alerting stimuli and internal states remains to be identified. Here, we report that the medial sector of the auditory thalamus (ATm), which consists of a group of non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei, can fulfill this function. VGluT2-expressing ATm (ATmVGluT2+) neurons receive direct and strong inputs from both visual and auditory midbrain regions, and project to multiple downstream structures critically involved in brain state regulation. Their activity was correlated with, and indispensable for, both blue light- and sound-induced NREM sleep-to-Wake transition, and their arousing effects were mainly mediated by, but not limited to, the temporal association cortices. ATmVGluT2+ neuron activation in awake behaving mice induced pupil dilation and behavioral responses suggestive of anxiety. Blocking the neurotransmitter release of ATmVGluT2+ neurons receiving auditory inputs selectively abolished loud noise-triggered escape behavior but not locomotion. Thus, the ATm is an interface in mouse brain that can transform alerting environmental cues into internal arousal and emotional state alterations that promote survival.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The domain-separation low-dimensional language network dynamics in the resting-state support the flexible functional segregation and integration during language and speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Modern linguistic theories and network science propose that the language and speech processing is organized into hierarchical, segregated large-scale subnetworks, with a core of dorsal (phonological) stream and ventral (semantic) stream. The two streams are asymmetrically recruited in receptive and expressive language or speech tasks, which showed flexible functional segregation and integration. We hypothesized that the functional segregation of the two streams was supported by the underlying network segregation. A dynamic conditional correlation approach was employed to construct frame-wise time-varying language networks and investigate the temporal reoccurring patterns. We found that the time-varying language networks in the resting-state robustly clustered into four low-dimensional states, which dynamically reconfigured following a domain-separation manner. Spatially, the hub distributions of the first three states highly resembled the neurobiology of primary auditory processing and lexical-phonological processing, motor and speech production processing, and semantic processing, respectively. The fourth state was characterized by the weakest functional connectivity and subserved as a baseline state. Temporally, the first three states appeared exclusively in limited time bins (~15%), and most of the time (> 55%), the language network kept inactive in state 4. Machine learning-based dFC-linguistics prediction analyses showed that dFCs of the four states significantly predicted individual linguistic performance. These findings suggest a domain-separation manner of language network dynamics in the resting-state, which forms a dynamic meta-networking (network of networks) framework.

                The basal ganglia are known to control actions and modulate movements. Neuronal activity in the two efferent pathways of the dorsal striatum, a major input to the basal ganglia, is critical for appropriate behavioral control. Previous evidence has led to divergent conclusions on the respective engagement of both pathways during actions. We used calcium imaging to evaluate how neurons in the direct and indirect pathways in the dorsal striatum encode behaviors during self-paced spontaneous explorations in an open field. We observed that the two striatal pathways exhibit distinct tuning properties during spontaneous behaviors. We applied supervised learning algorithms and found that direct pathway neurons encode behaviors through their activation, whereas indirect pathway neurons exhibit behavior-specific silencing. These properties remain stable for weeks. Our findings highlight a complementary encoding of behaviors in the two striatal pathways that supports an updated model, reconciling previous conflicting conclusions on motor encoding in the striatum.

	<p>Cognitive function is affected by low pressure and hypoxia in high-altitude environments, and is regulated by altitude and exposure time. With the economic development in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the increase in work and study activities, as well as the development of plateau tourism, mountaineering, and other activities, the number of plateau immigrants is increasing daily. Long-term hypoxia challenges human physical and mental health, restricts work efficiency, and thus affects plateau economic development and human wellbeing. Therefore, it is of scientific and social significance to study how long-term exposure to the hypoxic plateau environment affects the physical and mental health of lowlanders as part of the ongoing development of the current plateau region. In this paper, we reviewed the research progress and mechanism of the effects of long-term (&amp;amp;ge;1 year) high-altitude (&amp;amp;gt;2500 m) hypoxia exposure on the cognitive function of lowlanders, and suggested that the scope and sample size of the research should be expanded in the future, and that follow-up studies should be carried out to explore the time threshold of cognitive impairment and its compensatory or repair mechanism.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This systematic review aims to summarize the evidence investigating the effectiveness and safety of the Surpass Evolve-Flow Diverter (SE-FD) to treat brain aneurysms. Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2019 to 29 March 2022. Terms related to the &amp;amp;ldquo;intracranial aneurysm&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;surpass evolve flow diverter&amp;amp;rdquo; concepts were used to search the databases; Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and reference hand search were also utilized. Results: The searches primarily identified 1586 documents. A total of five studies (four case series and one cohort) were included in this review. In the included studies, 192 (74 male and 118 females) patients with 198 aneurysms were involved. In total, 153 SE-FDs were used to treat 145 aneurysms. Complete occlusion was achieved in 69/145 (48%) cases and near-complete occlusion in 24/145 (17%) cases from aneurysms treated with SE-FD. Reported postoperative complications included stent thrombosis (n = 4 patients), hemorrhage (n = 5 patients), ischemia (n = 9 patients), and neurological complications (n = 12 patients). In total, four deaths were reported with only one related to the SE-FD procedure. Conclusion: The results of this review are based on observational data, due to the absence of clinical trials. The findings of the included studies suggest that the effectiveness of the SE-FD procedure is lower than previous FDs but the safety is similar. The included studies also suggested that SE-FD has navigability and resistance to twisting, which makes the procedure an easier method to treat aneurysms that are proximal and distal to the circle of Willis deployment. This review highlights the urgency to conduct clinical trials to confirm these suggestions.</p>

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that exhibits unique neurological and behavioural characteristics. Our previous work using event-related potentials demonstrated that adults with ADHD process audiovisual multisensory stimuli somewhat differently than neurotypical controls. This study utilised an audiovisual multisensory two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task. Continuous whole-head electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Source localization (sLORETA) software was utilised to determine differences in the contribution made by sources of neural generators pertinent to audiovisual multisensory processing in those with ADHD versus neurotypical controls. Source localization techniques elucidated that the controls had greater neural activity 164 ms post-stimulus onset when compared to the ADHD group, but only when responding to audiovisual stimuli. The source of the increased activity was found to be Brodmann Area 2, postcentral gyrus, right-hemispheric parietal lobe referenced to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of X = 35, Y = &amp;amp;minus;40, and Z = 70 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). No group differences were present during either of the unisensory conditions. Differences in the integration areas, particularly in the right-hemispheric parietal brain regions, were found in those with ADHD. These alterations may correspond to impaired attentional capabilities when presented with multiple simultaneous sensory inputs, as is the case during a multisensory condition.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory neural tracking reflects target enhancementbut not distractor suppression in a psychophysically augmented continuous-speech paradigm</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, neuroscientists have collected conclusive evidence that selective attention to one of the most relevant signals in human environments - i.e., continuous speech - modulates neural phase-locked responses in auditory cortical regions ("neural tracking"). To test whether the human brain enhances targets or suppresses distraction when attending to speech, we here employed a psychophysically augmented speech-tracking paradigm with target, distractor and neutral streams. We demonstrate target enhancement to be behaviourally separable from distractor suppression, but no evidence for neural, below-baseline suppressive responses to distractors. A speech stimulus that was never task-relevant served as a neutral baseline, against which processing of concurrent target speech (relevant on present trial) and distractor speech (relevant on previous trial) was contrasted. Listeners (N = 19; male and female) had to detect short repeats in the target, which enabled us to contrast whether neural responses to target, neutral, or distractor speech would independently explain trial-by-trial variation in attention performance. Feasibility of the neutral baseline was evidenced by enhanced behavioural sensitivity when separating target-versus-distractor compared with target-versus-neutral speech. Temporal response functions revealed enhanced target speech tracking relative to neutral speech but no suppression of distraction below the neutral baseline. The amplitude of neural responses to target speech, but not to neutral or distractor speech, explained accuracy in behavioural repeat detection. Results indicate a necessary revision of the presumed role of enhanced phase-locked neural responses to speech to account for a specific sub-process of selective attention, that is, the enhancement of targets rather than the suppression of distraction.

Significance statementIs selective attention implemented along the central auditory pathway primarily via enhancement (i.e., neural gain) of behaviourally relevant targets, or by active (i.e., below-baseline) suppression of potential distractors, or both? Most current studies reporting attentional effects in the neural and behavioural response do not allow us to distinguish between such competing explanations of target enhancement versus distractor suppression. In a psychophysically augmented continuous-speech paradigm with three concurrently active sound locations, we show that selective attention to speech is implemented primarily via an enhancement of attended speech and not via suppression of distracting speech in the brain. These results suggest that the presumed role of neural responses to speech primarily reflects a specific sub process of selective attention, namely, target enhancement.

                Gene-environment interactions in the postnatal period have a long-term impact on neurodevelopment. To effectively model neurodevelopment in the mouse, we incorporated several validated behavioural tests to develop a behavioural pipeline that measures translationally relevant milestones of development in mice. The behavioral phenotype of 1060 wild type and genetically-modified mice was examined in parallel with structural brain imaging. The influence of genetics, sex, and early life stress on behaviour and neuroanatomy was determined using traditional statistical and machine learning methods. The results demonstrated that neuroanatomical diversity was primarily associated with genotype whereas behavioural phenotypic diversity was observed to be more susceptible to gene-environment interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Antisense oligonucleotide therapy rescues disturbed brain rhythms and sleep in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                UBE3A encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal UBE3A. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal UBE3A deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal UBE3A by suppressing UBE3A-ATS. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal Ube3a knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating Ube3a expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing Ube3a-ATS by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal Ube3a knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

                Neurons use various forms of negative feedback to maintain their synaptic strengths within an operationally useful range. While this homeostatic plasticity is thought to distinctly counteract the destabilizing positive feedback of Hebbian plasticity, there is considerable overlap in the molecular components mediating both forms of plasticity. The varying kinetics of these components spurs additional inquiry into the dynamics of synaptic homeostasis. We discovered that upscaling of synaptic weights in response to prolonged inactivity is nonmonotonic. Surprisingly, this seemingly oscillatory adaptation involved transient appropriation of molecular effectors associated with Hebbian plasticity, namely CaMKII, L-type Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, and homeostatic elements such as calcineurin. We created a dynamic model that shows how traditionally "Hebbian" and "homeostatic" mechanisms can cooperate to autoregulate postsynaptic Ca2+ levels. We propose that this combination of mechanisms allows excitatory synapses to adapt to prolonged activity changes and safeguard the capability to undergo future strengthening on demand.

                Comprehensive ethologically-relevant behavioural phenotyping in rodent experiments is essential for deciphering the neural basis of animal cognition. Automated home-cage monitoring systems present a valuable tool to fulfil this need. However, they often involve complex animal training routines, water or food deprivation, and probe a limited range of behaviours. Here, we present a new fully automated AI-driven home-cage system for cognitive and behavioural phenotyping in mice. The system incorporates spontaneous alternation T-maze, novel-object recognition and object-in-place recognition tests combined with monitoring of an animal position, water consumption, quiescence and locomotion patterns, all carried out continuously and simultaneously in an unsupervised fashion over long periods of time. Mice learnt the tasks rapidly without any need for water or food restrictions. We applied ethomics approach to show that combined statistical properties of multiple behaviours can be used to discriminate between mice with hippocampal, medial entorhinal and sham lesions and accurately predict genotype of Alzheimer disease mouse models on an individual animal level, surpassing the performance of several gold standard cognitive tests. This technology could enable large-scale behavioural screening for genes and neural circuits underlying spatial memory and other cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain injuries and complex motor learning suppress Olig2 in a subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are uniformly distributed in the mammalian brain, however their function is rather heterogeneous in respect to their origin, location, receptor/channel expression and age. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 is expressed in all OPCs as a pivotal determinant of their differentiation. Here, we identified a subset (2-26%) of OPCs lacking Olig2 in various brain regions including cortex, corpus callosum, CA1 and dentate gyrus. These Olig2 negative (Olig2neg) OPCs were enriched in the juvenile brain and decreased subsequently with age, being rarely detectable in the adult brain. However, the loss of this population was not due to apoptosis or microglia-dependent phagocytosis. Unlike Olig2pos OPCs, these subset cells could not be labelled for the mitotic marker Ki67. And, accordingly, BrdU was incorporated only by a three-day long-term labeling but not by a two-hour short pulse, suggesting these cells do not proliferate any more but were derived from proliferating OPCs. The Olig2neg OPCs exhibited a less complex morphology than Olig2pos ones. Olig2neg OPCs preferentially remain in a precursor stage rather than differentiating into highly branched oligodendrocytes. Changing the adjacent brain environment, e.g. by acute injuries or by complex motor learning tasks stimulated the transition of Olig2pos OPCs to Olig2neg cells in the adult. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OPCs transiently suppress Olig2 upon changes of the brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive oscillators provide a hard-coded Bayesian mechanism for rhythmic inference</a></h4>

              
                Bayesian theories of perception suggest that the human brain internalizes a model of environmental patterns to reduce sensory noise and improve stimulus processing. The internalization of external regularities is particularly manifest in the time domain: humans excel at predictively synchronizing their behavior with external rhythms, as in dance or music performance. The neural processes underlying rhythmic inferences are debated: whether predictive perception relies on high-level generative models or whether it can readily be implemented locally by hard-coded intrinsic oscillators synchronizing to rhythmic input remains unclear. Here, we propose that these seemingly antagonistic accounts can be conceptually reconciled. In this view, neural oscillators may constitute hard-coded physiological priors - in a Bayesian sense - that reduce temporal uncertainty and facilitate the predictive processing of noisy rhythms. To test this, we asked human participants to track pseudo-rhythmic tone sequences and assess whether the final tone was early or late. Using a Bayesian model, we account for various aspects of participants' performance and demonstrate that the classical distinction between absolute and relative mechanisms can be unified under this framework. Next, using a dynamical systems perspective, we successfully model this behavior using an adaptive frequency oscillator which adjusts its spontaneous frequency based on the rate of stimuli. This model better reflects human behavior than a canonical nonlinear oscillator and a predictive ramping model, both widely used for temporal estimation and prediction. Our findings suggest that an oscillator may be considered useful as a potential heuristic for a rhythmic prior in the Bayesian sense. Together, the results show that adaptive oscillators provide an elegant and biologically plausible means to subserve Bayesian rhythmic inference, thereby reconciling numerous empirical observations and a priori incompatible frameworks for temporal inferential processes.

	<p>Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is an epileptogenic malformation of the neocortex, as well as a leading cause of drug-resistant focal epilepsy in children and young adults. The synaptic dysfunctions leading to intractable seizures in this disease appear to have a tight relationship with the immaturity of GABAergic neurotransmission. The likely outcome would include hyperpolarizing responses upon activation of GABAARs. In addition, it is well-established that neuroinflammation plays a relevant role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. Here, we investigated whether IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, a prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, can influence GABAergic neurotransmission in FCD brain tissues. To this purpose, we carried out electrophysiological recordings on Xenopus oocytes transplanted with human tissues and performed a transcriptomics analysis. We found that IL-1&amp;amp;beta; decreases the GABA currents amplitude in tissue samples from adult individuals, while it potentiates GABA responses in samples from pediatric cases. Interestingly, these cases of pediatric FCD were characterized by a more depolarized EGABA and an altered transcriptomics profile, that revealed an up-regulation of chloride cotransporter NKCC1 and IL-1&amp;amp;beta;. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroinflammatory processes and altered chloride homeostasis can contribute together to increase the brain excitability underlying the occurrence of seizures in these children.</p>

	<p>Background: We investigated, for the first time, whether there are any sex differences in retrospective self-reported childhood maltreatment (CM) in Italian adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the potential impacts of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age on the CM self-report were investigated. Methods: This retrospective study used the data documented in the electronic medical records of patients who were hospitalized for a 4-week psychiatric rehabilitation program. CM was assessed using the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which evaluates emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect. The linear and logistic regression models were used (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.01). Results: Three hundred thirty-five patients with MDD (255 women and 80 men) and 168 with BD (97 women and 71 men) were included. In both samples, considerable CM rates were identified, but no statistically significant sex differences were detected in the variety of CTQ-based CM aspects. There was a significant association, with no sex differences, between increasing patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age and a decreasing burden of CM. Conclusion: Both women and men with MDD or BD experienced a similar and considerable CM burden. Our findings support routine CM assessment in psychiatric clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder strongly involving the formation of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) oligomers, which subsequently aggregate into the disease characteristic insoluble amyloid plaques, in addition to oxidative stress, inflammation and increased acetylcholinesterase activity. Moreover, A&amp;amp;beta; oligomers interfere with the expression and activity of Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT. In the present study, the potential multimodal effect of two synthetic isatin thiosemicarbazones (ITSCs), which have been previously shown to prevent A&amp;amp;beta; aggregation was evaluated. Both compounds resulted in fully reversing the A&amp;amp;beta;-mediated toxicity in SK-NS-H cells treated with exogenous A&amp;amp;beta; peptides at various pre-incubation time points and at 1 &amp;amp;mu;M. Cell survival was not recovered when compounds were applied after A&amp;amp;beta; cell treatment. The ITSCs were non-toxic against wild type and 5xFAD primary hippocampal cells. They reversed the inhibition of Akt and GSK-3&amp;amp;beta; phosphorylation in 5xFAD cells. Finally, they exhibited good antioxidant potential and moderate lipoxygenase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity. Overall, these results suggest that isatin thiosemicarbazone is a suitable scaffold for the development of multimodal anti-AD agents.</p>

	<p>Glioma peritumoral brain edema (GPTBE) is a frequent complication in patients with glioma. The severity of peritumoral edema endangers patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life and prognosis. However, there are still questions concerning the process of GPTBE formation and evolution. In this study, the patients were split into two groups based on edema scoring findings in the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) comprising 186 TCGA-LGG patients. Using mRNA sequencing data, differential gene (DEG) expression analysis was performed, comparing the two groups to find the key genes affecting GPTBE. A functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed. Then, a protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) network was established, and important genes were screened. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were calculated for major gene sets and comparatively correlated with immune cell infiltration. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier curve. A total of 59 DEGs were found, with 10 of them appearing as important genes. DEGs were shown to be closely linked to inflammatory reactions. According to the network score, IL10 was in the middle of the network. The presence of the IL10 protein in glioma tissues was verified using the human protein atlas (HPA). Furthermore, the gene sets&amp;amp;rsquo; GSVA scores were favorably linked with immune infiltration, particularly, with macrophages. The high-edema group had higher GSVA scores than the low-edema group. Finally, Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analysis revealed no differences in OS between the two groups, and eight genes were found to be related to prognosis, whereas two genes were not. GPTBE is linked to the expression of inflammatory genes.</p>

	<p>Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is an uncommon entity in which a presurgical suspicion may be crucial for patient management. Maximal safe neurosurgical resection is of choice when PTPR is suspected, whereas non-surgical approaches can be considered in other tumors of the pineal region, such as pineocytoma or concrete subtypes of germ-cell tumors. In general terms, imaging features of tumors of the pineal region have been reported to be unspecific. Nevertheless, in this report, we describe two pathology-confirmed PTPRs in which presurgical proton MR spectroscopy demonstrated extremely high myoinositol, a pattern which drastically differs from that of other pineal tumors. We hypothesize that this high myoinositol may be related to PTPR&amp;amp;rsquo;s known ependymal component, and that it could be used as a specific non-invasive diagnostic signature.</p>

	<p>Objective: To investigate the relationship between post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and severe post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) and explore the risk factors related to PSCI combined with severe PSD. Methods: Data from patients were collated from the rehabilitation-specific disease database. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Study (VFSS), Penetration-aspiration Scale (PAS), and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) were used to evaluate cognitive and swallowing functions. Differences between groups were determined by the Pearson chi-square test (&amp;amp;chi;2) or Fisher exact test. PAS and FOIS data were analyzed with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis test in the prespecified subgroup analysis. Risk factors were investigated by multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 1555 patients were identified with PSCI. The results indicated that patients with PSCI had a higher incidence rate of severe PSD as compared to patients without PSCI (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with severe PSCI were more likely to clinically manifest oral phase dysfunction (p = 0.024), while mild PSCI patients mainly manifested pharyngeal phase dysfunction (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). There was a significant difference in FOIS score changes between subgroups during the hospitalization period (severe PSCI vs. moderate PSCI and severe PSCI vs. mild PSCI) (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, multivariate logistic regression revealed pneumonia (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), tracheotomy (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and dysarthria (p = 0.006) were related to PSCI, combined with severe PSD. Conclusion: PSCI may be related to severe PSD. Patients with severe PSCI were more likely to manifest oral phase dysfunction, while mild PSCI manifested pharyngeal phase dysfunction. Pneumonia, tracheotomy, and dysarthria were risk factors related to PSCI combined with severe PSD.</p>

	<p>Literature reviews appear to indicate that Music Therapy (MT) may instil a sense of empowerment and generate feelings of renewed self-confidence, distracting subjects who follow this type of intervention from negative thoughts and, generally, helping patients suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN) to redevelop or rediscover their identity. The purpose of the study reported in this paper is to investigate whether MT proposed before an evening meal is capable of decreasing pre-meal anxiety in adolescents suffering from AN who follow the Day-hospital Treatment Programme at the San Bortolo Hospital of Vicenza (Italy). A total of 24 patients participated voluntarily in once-weekly sessions of group-based MT conducted by a qualified music therapist over a period of six months. Before evening meals on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, pre-meal anxiety was measured using a self-report scale, and the MT group session occurred every Wednesday before the evening meal was consumed. MT activities were both active and receptive. It has been found that with respect to Mondays and Tuesdays, pre-meal anxiety was significantly lower on Wednesdays following participation in the MT group. MT is evidently capable of reducing pre-meal anxiety and may be adopted as a supportive element in treatment plans relating to patients with AN in a day-hospital treatment programme.</p>

<p>In addition to their auditory nerve inputs, we show that T-stellate cells within a given isofrequency lamina provide a second modulatable monosynaptic excitatory input to other T-stellate cells as well as to inhibitory L- and D-stellate cells. This circuit may play a significant role in acoustic information processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>T-stellate cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are known to have local axon collaterals that terminate in the vicinity of their dendrites and cell bodies within the same isofrequency lamina in parallel with the auditory nerve fibers that innervate them. Excitatory synaptic connections between stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina are hypothesized to be involved in the nitric oxide-mediated upregulation of T-stellate responses to their auditory input. This could serve as a mechanism of variable gain control in the enhancement of responses to vowel spectral peaks. Previous studies have provided indirect evidence for these possible synaptic interconnections between T-stellate cells, but unequivocal identification has yet to be established. Here, we used retrograde neuronal tracing with adeno-associated viral vector or biotinylated dextran amine injected into the inferior colliculus (IC) to detect the postsynaptic target of T-stellate cells within the VCN. We show that backfilled T-stellate cell axons make monosynapatic connections on the labeled cell bodies and dendrites of other labeled T-stellate cells within an isofrequency lamina. Electron microscopy revealed that T-stellate terminals can also make synapses on structures not retrogradely labeled from the IC. Glycine antibodies combined with the viral labeling indicated that these nonbackfilled structures that the labeled T-stellate terminals were synapsing on are most likely the cell bodies and dendrites of two size categories of glycinergic VCN cells, whose sizes and relative numbers indicated they are the D- and L-stellate cells. These cells are known to provide inhibitory inputs back onto T-stellate cells. Our data indicate that, in addition to their auditory nerve input, T-stellate cells provide a second modulatable excitatory input to both inhibitory and excitatory cells in a VCN isofrequency lamina and may play a significant role in acoustic information processing.</p>

     alt="Sex-specific cannabinoid 1 receptors on GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray mediate analgesia in mice"/><p>Compared with male mice, female mice have higher expression of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Thereby, activation of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs disinhibits GABA-vGlut2 feedforward inhibitory circuitry, which contributes to descending pain modulation. This contribution occurs to a greater extent in female mice than in male mice, which eventually exerts more robust analgesia in females.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sex differences in analgesic effects have gradually attracted public attention in preclinical and clinical studies. Both human and animal females are more sensitive to cannabinoid antinociception than males. Expression of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) and the function of the endocannabinoid system have been explored in both male and female mice and CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) participate in antinociception. However, whether there are cell-type- and sex-specific patterns of vlPAG CB<sub>1</sub>R expression that affect analgesia is unknown. In the current study, we either activated or inhibited CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG and found that female mice produced stronger analgesia or developed more robust mechanical allodynia than males did. Specific deletion of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG promoted stronger mechanical allodynia in female mice than that in male mice. However, no sex differences in cannabinoid antinociception were found following chemogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that the sex difference in cannabinoid antinociception was due to females having higher expression of GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG than males. Furthermore, activation of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in the vlPAG significantly reduced the frequency of GABA-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded in vGlut2-tdTomato positive neurons in both sexes. This effect was greater in females than males and this reduction was closely related to CB<sub>1</sub>R expression difference between sexes. Our work indicates that vlPAG GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs modulate cannabinoid-mediated analgesia in a sex-specific manner, which may provide a potential explanation of sex difference found in the analgesic effect of cannabinoids.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributing task-related neural activity across a cortical networkthrough task-independent connections</a></h4>

              
                Task-related neural activity is widespread across populations of neurons during goal-directed behaviors. However, little is known about the synaptic reorganization and circuit mechanisms that lead to broad activity changes. Here we trained a limited subset of neurons in a spiking network with strong synaptic interactions to reproduce the activity of neurons in the motor cortex during a decision-making task. We found that task-related activity, resembling the neural data, emerged across the network, even in the untrained neurons. Analysis of trained networks showed that strong untrained synapses, which were independent of the task and determined the dynamical state of the network, mediated the spread of task-related activity. Optogenetic perturbations suggest that the motor cortex is strongly-coupled, supporting the applicability of the mechanism to cortical networks. Our results reveal a cortical mechanism that facilitates distributed representations of task-variables by spreading the activity from a subset of plastic neurons to the entire network through task-independent strong synapses.

                Prediction learning is considered a fundamental feature of biological systems that underlies perception, action, and reward. For cultural artifacts like music, isolating the genesis of reward from prediction is challenging, since predictions are acquired implicitly throughout life. Here, we examined the trajectory of listeners preferences for melodies in a novel musical scale, where local and global predictions were independently manipulated. Across seven studies (n = 842 total) in two cultures, participants preferred melodies that were presented more during exposure (globally predictable) and that followed schematic expectations (locally predictable). Learning trajectories depended on music reward sensitivity. Furthermore, fMRI showed that while auditory cortical activation reflects predictions, functional connectivity between auditory and reward areas encodes preference. The results are the first to show a hierarchical, relatively culturally-independent process by which predictions map onto reward. Collectively, our findings propose a novel mechanism by which the human brain links predictions with reward value.

                Microglia are the brains resident immune cells, performing surveillance to promote homeostasis and healthy functioning. While chemical signaling in microglia is well-studied, the mechanical cues regulating their function are less well-understood. Here, we investigate the role of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in microglia migration, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and stiffness sensing. We demonstrated the functional expression of Piezo1 in microglia and identified genes whose expression was affected by conditional Piezo1 knockout in transgenic mice. Functional assays revealed that Piezo1-deficiency in microglia enhanced migration towards amyloid {beta}-protein, and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, both in vitro and in vivo. The phenomenon could be mimicked or reversed using a Piezo1-specific agonist or antagonist. Finally, we also showed that Piezo1 mediated the effect of substrate stiffness-induced migration and cytokine expression. Altogether, we show that Piezo1 is an important molecular mediator for microglia, its activation modulating their migration and immune responses.

                SignificanceIn vivo imaging and electrophysiology are powerful tools to explore neuronal function that each offer unique complementary information with advantages and limitations. Capturing both data types from the same neural population in the freely moving animal would allow researchers to take advantage of the capabilities of both modalities and further understand how they relate to each other.

AimHere we present a head-mounted neural implant suitable for in vivo two-photon imaging of neuronal activity with simultaneous extracellular electrical recording in head-fixed or freely moving animals.

ApproachA GRIN lens-based head-mounted neural implant with extracellular electrical recording provided by tetrodes on the periphery of the GRIN lens was chronically implanted. The design of the neural implant allows for recording from head-fixed animals, as well as freely moving animals by coupling the imaging system to a coherent imaging fiber bundle.

ResultsWe demonstrate simultaneous two-photon imaging of GCaMP and extracellular electrophysiology of neural activity in awake head-fixed, and freely moving mice. Using the collected information, we perform correlation analysis to reveal positive correlation between optical and local field potential recordings.

ConclusionSimultaneously recording neural activity using both optical and electrical methods provides complementary information from each modality. Designs that can provide such bimodal recording in freely moving animals allow for the investigation of neural activity underlying a broader range of behavioral paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two types of motor inhibition after action errors in humans</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior requires the ability to appropriately react to action errors. Post-error slowing of response times (PES) is one of the most reliable phenomena in cognitive neuroscience. It has been proposed that PES is partially achieved through inhibition of the motor system. However, there is no direct evidence for this link - or indeed, that the motor system is physiologically inhibited after errors altogether. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography to measure cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) across four experiments using a Simon task, in which human participants sometimes committed errors. Errors were followed by reduced CSE at two different time points, and in two different modes. Shortly after error commission (250ms) CSE was broadly suppressed - i.e., even task-unrelated motor effectors were inhibited. During the preparation of the subsequent response, CSE was specifically reduced at task-related effectors only. This latter effect was directly related to PES, with stronger CSE suppression accompanying greater PES. This suggests that PES is achieved through increased inhibitory control during post-error responses. To provide converging evidence, we then re-analyzed an openly-available EEG dataset that contained both Simon- and Stop-signal tasks using independent component analysis. We found that the same neural source component that indexed action-cancellation in the stop-signal task also showed clear PES-related activity during post-error responses in the Simon task. Together, these findings provide clear evidence that post-error adaptation is partially achieved through motor inhibition. Moreover, inhibition is engaged in two modes (first non-selective, then selective), aligning with recent multi-stage theories of error processing.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system with features of demyelination and axonal degeneration at a young age. Genetic factors may play an important role in the development of multiple sclerosis. (1) Objective: To investigate IL-10 rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, and IL-10 serum levels in patients with multiple sclerosis. (2) Methods: Our study included patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 127) and healthy volunteers (n = 195). The subjects&amp;amp;rsquo; DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and genotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed using the program &amp;amp;ldquo;IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0&amp;amp;rdquo;. (3) Results: The IL-10 SNPs were analyzed between the MS and control groups; however, no statistically significant results were found. The serum levels of IL-10 in the groups of MS and healthy subjects were not statistically significantly different (median (IQR): 0.828 (1.533) vs. 0.756 (0.528), p = 0.872). (4) Conclusions:&amp;amp;nbsp;IL-10 rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896 and serum IL-10 levels are not likely to be associated with MS development. However, individuals carrying the rare haplotypes of rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896 were associated with increased odds of MS (p = 0.006).</p>

	<p>Many research methods applied in molecular neuroscience require the collection of hippocampal samples, but a still poorly recognized problem is contamination with the choroid plexus during brain dissection. Because of a distinct pattern of gene expression, its inclusion in brain samples can obscure or even confound conclusions drawn from molecular studies. Therefore, we tested our dissection method designed for removal of tissue contamination using expression of the transthyretin gene (Ttr) as a marker of the choroid plexus. Additionally, we also validated dissection of the entire hippocampus into its dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions using the expression of Trhr and Lct genes as molecular markers of anatomical subdivisions. The PCR analysis showed that Ttr is expressed at a residual level in hippocampal samples that display an mRNA level several hundred lower than the adjacent control tissue colocalized with the choroid plexus. This indicates that the applied method for dissecting the hippocampus from a fresh brain allows for replicable removal of the majority of choroid plexus from hippocampal samples. In turn, differences in expression of Lct and Trhr confirmed the proper dissection of dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions from fresh brain tissue. Therefore, a special emphasis on the removal of tissue contamination and avoidance of tissue distortions makes our protocol especially suitable for molecular experiments performed either on the entire hippocampus or its subdivisions.</p>

	<p>Brain asymmetry is connected with motor performance, suggesting that hemiparetic patients have different gait patterns depending on the side of the lesion. This retrospective cohort study aims to further investigate the difference between right and left hemiplegia in order to assess whether the injured side can influence the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical characteristics concerning gait, thus providing insights for new personalized rehabilitation strategies. The data from 33 stroke patients (17 with left and 16 with right hemiplegia) were retrospectively compared with each other and with a control group composed of 20 unaffected age-matched individuals. The 3D gait analysis was used to assess kinematic data and spatio-temporal parameters. Compared to left hemiplegic patients, right hemiplegic patients showed worse spatio-temporal parameters (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and better kinematic parameters (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Both pathological groups were characterized by abnormal gait parameters in comparison with the control group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). These findings show an association between the side of the lesion&amp;amp;mdash;right or left&amp;amp;mdash;and the different stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; gait patterns: left hemiplegic patients show better spatio-temporal parameters, whereas right hemiplegic patients show better segmentary motor performances. Therefore, further studies may develop and assess new personalized rehabilitation strategies considering the injured hemisphere and brain asymmetry.</p>
