                Background: The exponential increase in pattern of vehicles on the roads demands a need to develop a vehicular infrastructure that may not only ease congestions and provide a better experience but also pivot the levels of safety among users. The development of wireless technology has made it convenient for machines, devices and vehicles to interact with one another. The efficacy of this wireless communications relies on utilising current and available technology to enable information to be shared efficiently. In the wake of the available advancement in wireless technology, a new dynamic spectrum management (DSM) in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication that coexists with the existing Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network to increase the throughput in V2V communication is proposed. This will provide some solutions to enable a more efficient vehicular infrastructure. Methods: This paper focuses on the utilization of DSM in V2V communications by selecting an appropriate frequency band through the selection of available licensed and unlicensed frequency bands for vehicles. Further investigations are done to identify the effect of interference in the dynamic spectrum by observing the path loss, SINR, and the throughput with various interfering users. Results: The results show that the performance of the proposed DSM augments a significant improvement in the overall throughput and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) value is reduced by up to 60% when compared to the fixed spectrum allocation. Conclusions: Although the dynamic spectrum is still affected by the interference from the existing cellular users, the throughput of the dynamic spectrum remains sufficient to transmit the information to other vehicles.

                Purpose: The research evaluates if teachers can achieve better teaching outcomes by using a proposed mobile interactive system (MIS) developed for this study as an additional approach to enhancing teachers’ proficiency in Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in the virtual classroom.   Background: According to previous studies, teachers’ self-assessment on TPACK might be affected by their egos because they have autonomy over the students in the classroom. Some studies suggest that utilisation of an interactive whiteboard (IWB) promotes creativity in teaching and learning but that it is unsuitable for a virtual environment due to its large size and the high maintenance costs associated with owning one in a teacher’s residence. Besides, some studies also reveal that allowing the students to assess their teachers through TPACK  is able to reduce potential errors which might result from the TPACK self-assessment done by teachers.   Methods: Pre- and post- experiments were conducted with the developed MIS integrated into teaching process. Synchronous display (SD) and whiteboard-like freehand writing (WFW) were features of the MIS integrated into the experimental group. Questionnaires were distributed to the students, and a reflective measurement model was formed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS Statistics.   Findings: Based on our findings, teachers’ Technological Content Knowledge had a significant positive effect on TPACK with the inclusion of MIS in online teaching. Predictive relevance was also evaluated through a Q2 value to predict the endogenous construct of the constructed model. The Q2 value was greater than zero, indicating that the model possesses a predictive relevance.   Conclusion: The integration of the developed MIS in the virtual classroom has a significant positive impact on the students’ academic performance relating to concept learning and knowledge acquisition of subject matter.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach to explore multiple infection and evolution in HIV</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jesse Kreger, Natalia L. Komarova, Dominik Wodarz</p>

To study viral evolutionary processes within patients, mathematical models have been instrumental. Yet, the need for stochastic simulations of minority mutant dynamics can pose computational challenges, especially in heterogeneous systems where very large and very small sub-populations coexist. Here, we describe a hybrid stochastic-deterministic algorithm to simulate mutant evolution in large viral populations, such as acute HIV-1 infection, and further include the multiple infection of cells. We demonstrate that the hybrid method can approximate the fully stochastic dynamics with sufficient accuracy at a fraction of the computational time, and quantify evolutionary end points that cannot be expressed by deterministic models, such as the mutant distribution or the probability of mutant existence at a given infected cell population size. We apply this method to study the role of multiple infection and intracellular interactions among different virus strains (such as complementation and interference) for mutant evolution. Multiple infection is predicted to increase the number of mutants at a given infected cell population size, due to a larger number of infection events. We further find that viral complementation can significantly enhance the spread of disadvantageous mutants, but only in select circumstances: it requires the occurrence of direct cell-to-cell transmission through virological synapses, as well as a substantial fitness disadvantage of the mutant, most likely corresponding to defective virus particles. This, however, likely has strong biological consequences because defective viruses can carry genetic diversity that can be incorporated into functional virus genomes via recombination. Through this mechanism, synaptic transmission in HIV might promote virus evolvability.

Urbanowicz, Didier Ndeh, Serena Monaco, Laura Sánchez Salom, Ryan Griffiths, Raven S. Reynolds, Anna Colvile, Daniel I. R. Spencer, Martin Walsh, Jesus Angulo, Nathalie Juge</p>

The human gut symbiont <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> displays strain-specific repertoires of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) contributing to its spatial location in the gut. Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> ATCC 29149, <i>Rg</i>GH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that <i>Rg</i>GH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed <i>Rg</i>GH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of <i>Rg</i>GH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of <i>Rg</i>GH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of <i>Rg</i>GH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that <i>Rg</i>GH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed <i>Rg</i>GH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that <i>Rg</i>GH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with <i>Rg</i>GH98 confered <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, that is, on days 13, 15, 17, or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during, and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY—an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Childhood malnutrition and hypo mineralized molar defects: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Malnutrition is well-known to yield high morbidities and mortalities and considering its consequence on the oral cavity, malnutrition is shown to have pre-eruptive and post-eruptive outcomes. The objective was to assess the prevalence of hypo-mineralized second primary molar (HSPM), molar–incisor hypo-mineralization (MIH) and dental caries in malnourished children as well as addressing the relation between types of malnutrition of the children and their dental morbidities represented in HSPM, MIH and dental caries. Methods: This is a cross sectional analytical study. Malnourished children aged 5-10 years and presented to the Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University were examined for HSPM. MIH using European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry criteria and dental Caries using def/ DMF indices. Results:  A consecutive sample (a long six months) of 54 malnourished children were enrolled in the study. Dental caries was a greater dental morbidity in the overweight and obese group. Besides, stunting was a greater risk in HSPM and MIH. There was an association between HSPM and MIH in a considerable percentage of the study group. Conclusions: Malnutrition is a risk factor for dental abnormalities. HSPM could expect the presence of MIH.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perspectives on Open Science and Scholarly Publishing: a Survey Study Focusing on Early Career Researchers in Europe [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The value of Open Science (OS) for the academic community and society has been becoming more evident recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, significant challenges regarding its implementation arise that are likely to affect researchers, especially those in early career stages. Hence, monitoring early-career researchers’ views, knowledge, and skills on OS and related policies, is crucial for its advancement. The main aim of this exploratory study was to gain new perspectives regarding the awareness of and attitudes towards OS and related practices having in consideration geographical, economic and research career variables. Methods: The survey was conducted during May-August 2020 as part of a collaboration between Eurodoc and the Open Research Europe project. The data from the survey were analyzed by European region, Gross domestic product, Gross domestic expenditure on research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product, field of study, and career stage. Results: The awareness and positive attitude regarding OS, specifically among early-career researchers, is high in Europe. However, there are significant career stage group differences in views and knowledge about OS. Generally, awareness and positive attitude tend to increase with increasing career seniority. Regarding European regions, we spotted three main groups sharing similar awareness levels and attitudes: researchers in Western Europe - the most informed group towards OS; researchers in northern, central, and southern Europe - a moderately informed group with some minor differences; and researchers in eastern Europe - the least informed group, whose opinions deviate the most. Conclusions: We found that there is an “evolution of needs and focus” regarding scientific publishing: researchers in most European regions are in different stages of transition from the competitive to collaborative levels, while researchers in eastern Europe are largely beginning their transition to the competitive level.

                Background: Andrographolide (Andro) is a diterpenoid component of the plant Andrographis paniculata that is known for its anti-tumor activity against a variety of cancer cells.   Methods: We studied the effects of Andro on the viability of the human leukemia monocytic cell line THP-1 and the human multiple myeloma cell line H929. Andro was compared with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and vincristine (VCR), which are well-established therapeutics against hematopoietic tumors. The importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for the toxicity of each agent was investigated by using an inhibitor of ROS production, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).    Results:  Andro reduced the viability of THP-1 and H929 in a dose-dependent manner. H929 viability was highly susceptible to Andro, although only slightly susceptible to Ara-C. The agents Andro, Ara-C, and VCR each induced apoptosis, as shown by cellular shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and increases in annexin V-binding, caspase-3/7 activity, ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Whereas Ara-C and VCR increased the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, respectively, Andro showed little or no detectable effect on cell cycle progression. The apoptotic activities of Andro were largely suppressed by NAC, an inhibitor of ROS production, whereas NAC hardly affected the apoptotic activities of Ara-C and VCR.  Conclusions: Andro induces ROS-dependent apoptosis in monocytic leukemia THP-1 and multiple myeloma H929 cells, underlining its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating hematopoietic tumors. The high toxicity for (thus forming: The high toxicity for H929 cells, by a mechanism that is different from that of Ara-C and VCR, is encouraging for further studies on the use of Andro against multiple myeloma.) H929 cells, by a mechanism that is different from that of Ara-C and VCR, is encouraging for further studies on the use of Andro against multiple myeloma.

                A clear understanding of the origin and role of the different subtypes of the B cell lineage involved in the activity or remission of multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for the treatment and follow-up of patients living with this disease. B cells, however, are dynamic and can play an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory role, depending on their milieu. Depletion of B cells has been effective in controlling the progression of MS, but it can have adverse side effects. A better understanding of the role of the B cell subtypes, through the use of surface biomarkers of cellular activity with special attention to the function of memory and regulatory B cells (Bregs), will be necessary in order to offer specific treatments without inducing undesirable effects.

                Background: As NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries participate in many international missions and joint operations around the world, NATO considered it a necessity for personnel to be able to communicate in a common language. Therefore, one of the main tasks of the NATO multinational setting is the teaching and the assessment of languages. Consequently, there is a need for personnel to achieve the Standard Language Profiles (SLP). Each NATO country must develop SLP exams to achieve the required levels based on NATO STANAG (Standard agreement) 6001. If the examinees do not achieve those levels and the global results are unsatisfactory, NATO members can be affected by a reduction of financial support or the assignment to NATO postings. This study aimed to create a training strategies proposal (TSP) for personnel to achieve NATO L2. Methods: The study consisted of four separate studies: 1) Preliminary survey/interview of military personnel about NATO L2 training; 2) gathering data from NATO L2 exams after normal training; 3) gathering of data from NATO L2 exams after the TSP had been implemented; 4) Post-training survey. Data was collected from examinees over a period of six months or one year, using mixed data collection methods: surveys, interviews, and exam results. Results: A total of 50 examinees took part in the study. Results showed that the number of examinees who passed the NATO L2 increased after going through the TSP. Conclusions: The results show that the TSP, using newer methodologies and different techniques, improved NATO L2 results. The outcomes of this study will help to inform future training and education programs.

                Background: Ethical dilemmas can occur in any situation in clinical medicine. In patients undergoing neuro-anesthesia for surgical procedure evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, anticoagulants should not be given because they can cause recurrent bleeding. Meanwhile, at the same time, the patient could also be infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one of treatment is the administration of anticoagulants. Methods: A case report. A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage due to a hemorrhagic stroke and was confirmed positive for COVID-19. Giving anticoagulants to patients is considered counterproductive so, an ethical dilemma arises. For this reason, a joint conference was held to obtain the best ethical and medicolegal solutions for the patient. Results: By using several methods of resolving ethical dilemmas such as basic ethical principles, supporting ethical principles, and medicolegal considerations, it was decided that the patient was not to be given anticoagulants. Conclusions: Giving anticoagulants to hemorrhagic stroke patients is dangerous even though it is beneficial for COVID-19 patients, so here the principle of risk-benefit balance is applied to patients who prioritize risk prevention rather than providing benefits. This is also supported by the prima facie principle by prioritizing the principle of non-maleficence rather than beneficence, the minus malum principle by seeking the lowest risk, and the double effect principle by making the best decision even in a slightly less favorable way as well as the medicolegal aspect by assessing patient safety and risk management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Senior Citizen Activity Centre E-commerce and Cybersecurity: The Way Ahead to IR 4.0 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - The Malaysian ageing community’s IT aptitude is limited and is a key factor preventing Malaysia’s ageing population from successfully entering Industry 4.0. This study aims to digitalize Malaysian older people with e-commerce. This will require cybersecurity awareness training due to potential cybersecurity threats when conducting business online.    Furthermore, this study advances the Industry 4.0 initiatives set by Malaysia’s National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework by means of a voluntary community-based training program. It also creates a policy that elevates Malaysia’s senior citizens’ current level of ICT innovation baseline commensurate with Industry 4.0 transformation standards.  Methods – Participatory action research was conducted with members in a Senior Citizen Activity Centre (PAWE) through focus group discussions. Each focus group consisted of 6-8 people. Through identifying the community’s problem in the focus groups, an e-commerce platform was developed for the elderly to commercialise their existing products. The dissemination of e-commerce training and cybersecurity awareness were also conducted as part of mitigating fraud relating to online transactions.    Results – The findings show that PAWE members’ IT aptitude was limited, that they needed assistance with understanding the e-commerce platform, and that they had limited cybersecurity awareness.   Conclusions – The country’s ageing population programs and services are preparing for an ageing nation. In order for Malaysia’s ageing population to become self-sustainable, researchers suggest that Malaysian older persons become entrepreneurs. Third generation entrepreneurs must also be supported by social innovation, technological innovation, and cybersecurity awareness, which leads to achieving IR 4.0 and meets the economic, social and sustainable environmental goals.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is a dynamic process that is based on and can be altered by experiences. Integrating memories of multiple experiences (memory integration) is the basis of flexible and complex decision-making. However, the mechanism of memory integration in neural networks of the brain remains poorly understood. In this study, we built a recurrent spiking network model and investigated the neural mechanism of memory integration before a decision is made (retrospective memory integration) at the neural circuit level. Our simulations suggest that retrospective memory integration accompanies reconfiguration of neural cell assemblies. Additionally, partially blocking neural network plasticity leads to failure of memory integration. These findings can potentially guide the experimental investigation of the neural mechanism of retrospective memory integration and serve as the basis for developing new artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

                <p>Current therapeutic development in ALS relies on individual randomized clinical trials to test a specific investigational product in a single patient population. This approach has intrinsic limitations including cost, time, and lack of flexibility. Adaptive platform trials represent a novel approach to investigate several interventions for a single disease in a continuous manner. Already in use in oncology, this approach is now being employed more often in neurology. Here, we describe a newly launched, platform trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products concurrently in people with ALS, with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments, biomarkers, and trial endpoints.</p>

     alt="Adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity due to peripheral nerve hyperexcitability based on voltage-gated potassium channel downregulation in male mice"/>
<p>We have shown that adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity, which may be caused by decreased expression of Kv1.1 in the sciatic nerve. Such decrease caused disruption of latency delay and amplitude decrease under the train-pulse stimulation of this nerve.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thyroid hormones play an important role in the central and peripheral nervous system functions. Approximately 50% of adult-onset hypothyroid patients have sensory symptoms including pain, possibly caused by peripheral neuropathy. However, the mechanism causing the pain has not been clarified. We generated an adult-onset hypothyroid model animal by administering 50 ppm propylthiouracil (PTU) for 5 weeks to male mice. Female mice were not tested in this study. Mechanical hypersensitivity, determined by the von Frey hair test, was observed during the PTU exposure and recovered after the exposure termination. The sciatic nerve compound action potential was also analyzed. Under single-pulse stimulation, no significant change in the threshold and conduction velocity was observed in the PTU-administered group. On the other hand, under train-pulse stimulation, the latency delay in the Aδ-fiber component was less in the PTU-administered group in Week 4 of PTU exposure, indicating relative hyperexcitability. Fluticasone, which is the anti-inflammatory agent with an ability to activate the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily A (Kv1), restored the decrease in the latency change ratio by PTU exposure under the train-pulse stimulation supporting our hypothesis that Kv1 may be involved in the conductivity change. Kv1.1 protein level decreased significantly in the sciatic nerve of the PTU-administered group. These results indicate that adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity owing to hyperexcitability of the peripheral nerve and that reduction of Kv1.1 level may be involved in such alteration.</p>

     alt="Homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability by probiotics in male germ-free mice"/>
<p>Probiotics, <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i>, induce homeostatic changes in the excitability of hippocampal neurons in a gut microbiome status-dependent manner in male germ-free mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that probiotics can influence the gut–brain axis to ameliorate somatic and behavioral symptoms associated with brain disorders. However, whether probiotics have effects on the electrophysiological activities of individual neurons in the brain has not been evaluated at a single-neuron resolution, and whether the neuronal effects of probiotics depend on the gut microbiome status have yet to be tested. Thus, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording-assisted electrophysiological characterizations of the neuronal effects of probiotics in male germ-free (GF) mice with and without gut microbiome colonization. Two weeks of treatment with probiotics (<i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i>) significantly and selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas reconstituting gut microbiota in GF mice reversed the effects of the probiotics leading to a decreased intrinsic excitability in hippocampal neurons. This bidirectional modulation of neuronal excitability by probiotics was observed in hippocampal neurons with corresponding basal membrane property and action potential waveform changes. However, unlike the hippocampus, the amygdala excitatory neurons did not show any electrophysiological changes to the probiotic treatment in either GF or conventionalized GF mice. Our findings demonstrate for the first time how probiotic treatment can have a significant influence on the electrophysiological properties of neurons, bidirectionally modulating their intrinsic excitability in a gut microbiota and brain area-specific manner.</p>

     alt="Increased structural covariance in brain regions for number processing and memory in children with developmental dyscalculia"/>
<p>In our work, we examined typically developing children and children with developmental dyscalculia by structural brain imaging. Our results suggest that developmental dyscalculia might be partially explained by delayed neuronal maturation. Our structural measure can be applied in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity deficit or autism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a developmental learning disability associated with deficits in processing numerical and mathematical information. Several studies demonstrated functional network alterations in DD. Yet, there are no studies, which examined the structural network integrity in DD. We compared whole-brain maps of volume based structural covariance between 19 (4 males) children with DD and 18 (4 males) typically developing children. We found elevated structural covariance in the DD group between the anterior intraparietal sulcus to the middle temporal and frontal gyrus (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, corrected). A hippocampus subfield analysis showed higher structural covariance in the DD group for area CA3 to the parahippocampal and calcarine sulcus, angular gyrus and anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus as well as to the lingual gyrus. Lower structural covariance in this group was seen for the subiculum to orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior insula and middle frontal gyrus. In contrast, the primary motor cortex (control region) revealed no difference in structural covariance between groups. Our results extend functional magnetic resonance studies by revealing abnormal gray matter integrity in children with DD. These findings thus indicate that the pathophysiology of DD is mediated by both structural and functional abnormalities in a network involved in number processing and memory function.</p>

                In a recent study, Treichel, Finholm et al. showed that the mechanoreceptor Piezo2 enables enteroendocrine cells in the intestinal epithelium to sense luminal contents. Through neuroepithelial signaling, these cells modulate intestinal motility and transit of digestive products.

                Wu et al. developed a sensitive GPCR activation-based ATP sensor, GRABATP1.0, for monitoring extracellular ATP dynamics under a variety of conditions. In zebrafish, GRABATP1.0 detected brain injury-induced in vivo propagation of ATP. In mouse cortex, GRABATP1.0 revealed ATP-releasing events at the resolution of a single astrocyte after LPS-induced inflammation.

                Yuan et al. construct a bivalent vaccine based on RBD sequence from two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely D614G and B.1.351. Vaccination with a single dose or a prime-boost regimen are both protective against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice. Bivalent vaccine elicits nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants in rhesus macaques in a third-dose regimen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Behavioral evidence for nested central pattern generator control of Drosophila grooming</a></h4>

              
                Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neurons or neural circuits that produce periodic output without requiring patterned input. More complex behaviors can be assembled from simpler subroutines, and nested CPGs have been proposed to coordinate their repetitive elements, organizing control over different time scales. Here, we use behavioral experiments to establish that <i>Drosophila</i> grooming may be controlled by nested CPGs. On a short time scale (5–7 Hz, ~ 200 ms/movement), flies clean with periodic leg sweeps and rubs. More surprisingly, transitions between bouts of head sweeping and leg rubbing are also periodic on a longer time scale (0.3–0.6 Hz, ~2 s/bout). We examine grooming at a range of temperatures to show that the frequencies of both oscillations increase—a hallmark of CPG control—and also that rhythms at the two time scales increase at the same rate, indicating that the nested CPGs may be linked. This relationship holds when sensory drive is held constant using optogenetic activation, but oscillations can decouple in spontaneously grooming flies, showing that alternative control modes are possible. Loss of sensory feedback does not disrupt periodicity but slow down the longer time scale alternation. Nested CPGs simplify the generation of complex but repetitive behaviors, and identifying them in <i>Drosophila</i> grooming presents an opportunity to map the neural circuits that constitute them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The induction of pyrenoid synthesis by hyperoxia and its implications for the natural diversity of photosynthetic responses in Chlamydomonas</a></h4>

              
                In algae, it is well established that the pyrenoid, a component of the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM), is essential for efficient photosynthesis at low CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the signal that triggers the formation of the pyrenoid has remained elusive. Here, we show that, in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, the pyrenoid is strongly induced by hyperoxia, even at high CO<sub>2</sub> or bicarbonate levels. These results suggest that the pyrenoid can be induced by a common product of photosynthesis specific to low CO<sub>2</sub> or hyperoxia. Consistent with this view, the photorespiratory by-product, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, induced the pyrenoid, suggesting that it acts as a signal. Finally, we show evidence for linkages between genetic variations in hyperoxia tolerance, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling, and pyrenoid morphologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pattern similarity in the frontoparietal control network reflects an "off-veridical" template that optimizes target-match decisions during visual search</a></h4>

              
                Theories of attention hypothesize the existence of an "attentional" or "target" template that contains task-relevant information in memory when searching for an object. The target template contributes to visual search by directing visual attention towards potential targets and serving as a decisional boundary for target identification. However, debate still exists regarding how template information is stored in the human brain. Here, we conducted a pattern-based fMRI study to assess how template information is encoded to optimize target-match decisions during visual search. To ensure that match decisions reflect visual search demands, we used a visual search paradigm in which all distractors were linearly separable but highly similar to the target and were known to shift the target representation away from the distractor features (Yu & Geng, 2019). In a separate match-to-sample probe task, we measured the target representation used for match decisions across two resting state networks that have long been hypothesized to maintain and control target information: the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and the visual network (VisN). Our results showed that lateral prefrontal cortex in FPCN maintained the context-dependent "off-veridical" template; in contrast, VisN encoded a veridical copy of the target feature during match decisions. By using behavioral drift diffusion modeling, we verified that the decision criterion during visual search and the probe task relied on a common biased target template. Taken together, our results suggest that sensory-veridical information is transformed in lateral prefrontal cortex into an adaptive code of target-relevant information that optimizes decision processes during visual search.

	<p>Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) are characterized by impairments in probabilistic reinforcement learning (RL), which is associated with dopaminergic circuitry encompassing the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. However, there are no studies examining dopaminergic genes with respect to probabilistic RL in SZ. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine the impact of dopaminergic genes on performance assessed by the Probabilistic Selection Task (PST) in patients with SZ in comparison to healthy control (HC) subjects. In our study, we included 138 SZ patients and 188 HC participants. Genetic analysis was performed with respect to the following genetic polymorphisms: rs4680 in COMT, rs907094 in DARP-32, rs2734839, rs936461, rs1800497, and rs6277 in DRD2, rs747302 and rs1800955 in DRD4 and rs28363170 and rs2975226 in DAT1 genes. The probabilistic RL task was completed by 59 SZ patients and 95 HC subjects. SZ patients performed significantly worse in acquiring reinforcement contingencies during the task in comparison to HCs. We found no significant association between genetic polymorphisms and RL among SZ patients; however, among HC participants with respect to the DAT1 rs28363170 polymorphism, individuals with 10-allele repeat genotypes performed better in comparison to 9-allele repeat carriers. The present study indicates the relevance of the DAT1 rs28363170 polymorphism in RL in HC participants.</p>

	<p>Findings on executive functions (EFs) in binge-eating disorder (BED) are inconsistent and possibly biased by associated comorbidities. This study aimed to identify whether distinct levels of physical and mental comorbidity are related to EFs in BED. General and food-specific EFs in n = 77 adults with BED were compared to population-based norms and associations with weight status, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder psychopathology were analyzed. To detect within-sample patterns of EF performance, k-means clustering was applied. The results indicated that participants&amp;amp;rsquo; general EFs were within the average range with slight deficits in alertness. While depression and eating disorder psychopathology were unrelated to EFs, weight status was associated with food-specific attentional bias that was significantly higher in obesity class 2 than in overweight/obesity class 1 and obesity class 3. Four meaningful clusters with distinct strengths and impairments in general and food-specific EFs but without differences in clinical variables were identified. Altogether, adults with BED showed few specific deficits compared to normative data. Performance was unrelated to depression and eating disorder psychopathology, while weight status was associated with food-specific EFs only. The results highlight the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the relevance of EFs in BED development and maintenance in neurologically healthy adults.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroscience lacks a diverse repertoire of model organisms, resulting in an incomplete understanding into the general principles of neural function. Ctenophores display many neurobiological and experimental features which make them a promising candidate to fill this gap. They possess a nerve net distributed across their body surface, in the epithelial layer. There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are ‘simple’ and lack distinct organisational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network is. We estimated body surface area in <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> using custom Optical Projection Tomography and Light Sheet Morphometry imaging systems. Using an antibody against tyrosinated α-tubulin we visualised the nerve net in situ and quantified the geometric properties using an automated segmentation approach. We characterised organisational rules of the epithelial nerve net in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely unchanged during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organisation of the network and showed that some of the geometric properties are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a ctenophore nerve net to date and demonstrates the amenability of <i>P. pileus</i> for whole organism network analysis.</p>

                Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

                Background: The microtumor environment is an area where tumor cells are surrounded by several cells such as immune cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells as well as blood and lymphatic vessels. It is known that various cytokines and growth factors are released by various cells surrounding the tumor and affect the growth of tumor cells. Differences in chemical composition in the microtumor environment can be detected using spectrometry. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of scanning absorbance spectrometry in differentiating cells based on the chemical composition of endoscopic biopsies of colorectal cancer patients. Methods: An endoscopic biopsy of the patient from Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta was collected and homogenized in phosphate buffer saline using TissueLyser. Scanning absorbance was performed using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The results of scanning absorbance were then processed using principal component analysis (PCA) in Orange Data-Mining version 3.28.0 software and the results were represented in a scatter plot diagram. Results: Based on the results of the analysis using PCA, three patients were identified in different quadrant regions, crc006 and crc011 obtained from patients with the differentiation status located close together while crc009 and undifferentiated were located far apart. Conclusion: This indicates the potential of scanning absorbance in differentiating the chemical composition of the tumor microenvironment from patient biopsies.

                Background: The aim of the study was to develop a research instrument to study the levels of health literacy for obesity prevention (HLFOP), as well as health behavior for obesity prevention (HBFOP). In addition, we investigated the causal model between health literacy and health behavior for obesity prevention among primary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 600 participants who were primary school students (aged 9-13 years) was conducted. The participants were selected from schools in all parts of Bangkok using multi-stage random sampling technique. The research instrument to assess HLFOP and HBFOP, constructed by the researchers, were utilized for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation model through linear structural relationship. Results: We found that HBFOP was directly influenced by heath literacy in the category of Critical Literacy with an effect size of 0.65 (p < 0.01), and was indirectly influenced in the category of Basic Literacy and Interactive Literacy through Critical Literacy with effect sizes of 0.46 and 0.58 (p<0.01), respectively. The model was consistent with the empirical data, with Chi-Square=13.68, df=7, p=0.05721, RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation)= 0.040,  SRMR (standardized root mean square residual)= 0.017 NFI (normal fit index)=0.99, GFI (goodness of fit index)=0.99, and AGFI (adjusted goodness of fit index)=0.97. Conclusions: HLFOP was influential on HBFOP in primary school students in the Bangkok Metropolis. The categories that were particularly influential were: 1) Basic Literacy: accessing health information skills; 2) Interactive Literacy: communication skills; and 3) Critical Literacy: media literacy and self-management skills.

Hosts diverge widely in how, and how well, they defend themselves against infection and immunopathology. Why are hosts so heterogeneous? Both epidemiology and life history are commonly hypothesized to influence host immune strategy, but the relationship between immune strategy and each factor has commonly been investigated in isolation. Here, we show that interactions between life history and epidemiology are crucial for determining optimal immune specificity and sensitivity. We propose a demographically-structured population dynamics model, in which we explore sensitivity and specificity of immune responses when epidemiological risks vary with age. We find that variation in life history traits associated with both reproduction and longevity alters optimal immune strategies–but the magnitude and sometimes even direction of these effects depends on how epidemiological risks vary across life. An especially compelling example that explains previously-puzzling empirical observations is that depending on whether infection risk declines or rises at reproductive maturity, later reproductive maturity can select for either greater or lower immune specificity, potentially illustrating why studies of lifespan and immune variation across taxa have been inconclusive. Thus, the sign of selection on the life history-immune specificity relationship can be reversed in different epidemiological contexts. Drawing on published life history data from a variety of chordate taxa, we generate testable predictions for this facet of the optimal immune strategy. Our results shed light on the causes of the heterogeneity found in immune defenses both within and among species and the ultimate variability of the relationship between life history and immune specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SWIFT: A deep learning approach to prediction of hypoxemic events in critically-Ill patients using SpO2 waveform prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Akshaya V. Annapragada, Joseph L. Greenstein, Sanjukta N. Bose, Bradford D. Winters, Sridevi V. Sarma, Raimond L. Winslow</p>

Hypoxemia is a significant driver of mortality and poor clinical outcomes in conditions such as brain injury and cardiac arrest in critically ill patients, including COVID-19 patients. Given the host of negative clinical outcomes attributed to hypoxemia, identifying patients likely to experience hypoxemia would offer valuable opportunities for early and thus more effective intervention. We present SWIFT (SpO<sub>2</sub> Waveform ICU Forecasting Technique), a deep learning model that predicts blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) waveforms 5 and 30 minutes in the future using only prior SpO<sub>2</sub> values as inputs. When tested on novel data, SWIFT predicts more than 80% and 60% of hypoxemic events in critically ill and COVID-19 patients, respectively. SWIFT also predicts SpO<sub>2</sub> waveforms with average MSE below .0007. SWIFT predicts both occurrence and magnitude of potential hypoxemic events 30 minutes in the future, allowing it to be used to inform clinical interventions, patient triaging, and optimal resource allocation. SWIFT may be used in clinical decision support systems to inform the management of critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stress generation, relaxation and size control in confined tumor growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Huaming Yan, Daniel Ramirez-Guerrero, John Lowengrub, Min Wu</p>

Experiments on tumor spheroids have shown that compressive stress from their environment can reversibly decrease tumor expansion rates and final sizes. Stress release experiments show that nonuniform anisotropic elastic stresses can be distributed throughout. The elastic stresses are maintained by structural proteins and adhesive molecules, and can be actively relaxed by a variety of biophysical processes. In this paper, we present a new continuum model to investigate how the growth-induced elastic stresses and active stress relaxation, in conjunction with cell size control feedback machinery, regulate the cell density and stress distributions within growing tumors as well as the tumor sizes in the presence of external physical confinement and gradients of growth-promoting chemical fields. We introduce an adaptive reference map that relates the current position with the reference position but adapts to the current position in the Eulerian frame (lab coordinates) via relaxation. This type of stress relaxation is similar to but simpler than the classical Maxwell model of viscoelasticity in its formulation. By fitting the model to experimental data from two independent studies of tumor spheroid growth and their cell density distributions, treating the tumors as incompressible, neo-Hookean elastic materials, we find that the rates of stress relaxation of tumor tissues can be comparable to volumetric growth rates. Our study provides insight on how the biophysical properties of the tumor and host microenvironment, mechanical feedback control and diffusion-limited differential growth act in concert to regulate spatial patterns of stress and growth. When the tumor is stiffer than the host, our model predicts tumors are more able to change their size and mechanical state autonomously, which may help to explain why increased tumor stiffness is an established hallmark of malignant tumors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale model for forecasting Sabin 2 vaccine virus household and community transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Famulare, Wesley Wong, Rashidul Haque, James A. Platts-Mills, Parimalendu Saha, Asma B. Aziz, Tahmina Ahmed, Md Ohedul Islam, Md Jashim Uddin, Ananda S. Bandyopadhyay, Mohammed Yunus, Khalequ Zaman, Mami Taniuchi</p>

Since the global withdrawal of Sabin 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) from routine immunization, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has reported multiple circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks. Here, we generated an agent-based, mechanistic model designed to assess OPV-related vaccine virus transmission risk in populations with heterogeneous immunity, demography, and social mixing patterns. To showcase the utility of our model, we present a simulation of mOPV2-related Sabin 2 transmission in rural Matlab, Bangladesh based on stool samples collected from infants and their household contacts during an mOPV2 clinical trial. Sabin 2 transmission following the mOPV2 clinical trial was replicated by specifying multiple, heterogeneous contact rates based on household and community membership. Once calibrated, the model generated Matlab-specific insights regarding poliovirus transmission following an accidental point importation or mass vaccination event. We also show that assuming homogeneous contact rates (mass action), as is common of poliovirus forecast models, does not accurately represent the clinical trial and risks overestimating forecasted poliovirus outbreak probability. Our study identifies household and community structure as an important source of transmission heterogeneity when assessing OPV-related transmission risk and provides a calibratable framework for expanding these analyses to other populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conditional prediction of consecutive tumor evolution using cancer progression models: What genotype comes next?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Juan Diaz-Colunga, Ramon Diaz-Uriarte</p>

Accurate prediction of tumor progression is key for adaptive therapy and precision medicine. Cancer progression models (CPMs) can be used to infer dependencies in mutation accumulation from cross-sectional data and provide predictions of tumor progression paths. However, their performance when predicting complete evolutionary trajectories is limited by violations of assumptions and the size of available data sets. Instead of predicting full tumor progression paths, here we focus on short-term predictions, more relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We examine whether five distinct CPMs can be used to answer the question “Given that a genotype with <i>n</i> mutations has been observed, what genotype with <i>n</i> + 1 mutations is next in the path of tumor progression?” or, shortly, “What genotype comes next?”. Using simulated data we find that under specific combinations of genotype and fitness landscape characteristics CPMs can provide predictions of short-term evolution that closely match the true probabilities, and that some genotype characteristics can be much more relevant than global features. Application of these methods to 25 cancer data sets shows that their use is hampered by a lack of information needed to make principled decisions about method choice. Fruitful use of these methods for short-term predictions requires adapting method’s use to local genotype characteristics and obtaining reliable indicators of performance; it will also be necessary to clarify the interpretation of the method’s results when key assumptions do not hold.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Evolutionary pathways to SARS-CoV-2 resistance are opened and closed by epistasis acting on ACE2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gianni M. Castiglione, Lingli Zhou, Zhenhua Xu, Zachary Neiman, Chien-Fu Hung, Elia J. Duh</p>

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously predicted, binding a diversity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) orthologs despite extensive sequence divergence. Within this sequence degeneracy, we identify a rare sequence combination capable of conferring SARS-CoV-2 resistance. We demonstrate that this sequence was likely unattainable during human evolution due to deleterious effects on ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity, which has vasodilatory and cardioprotective functions in vivo. Across the 25 ACE2 sites implicated in viral binding, we identify 6 amino acid substitutions unique to mouse—one of the only known mammalian species immune to SARS-CoV-2. Substituting human variants at these positions is sufficient to confer binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mouse ACE2, facilitating cellular infection. Conversely, substituting mouse variants into either human or dog ACE2 abolishes viral binding, diminishing cellular infection. However, these same substitutions decrease human ACE2 activity by 50% and are predicted as pathogenic, consistent with the extreme rarity of human polymorphisms at these sites. This trade-off can be avoided, however, depending on genetic background; if substituted simultaneously, these same mutations have no deleterious effect on dog ACE2 nor that of the rodent ancestor estimated to exist 70 million years ago. This genetic contingency (epistasis) may have therefore opened the road to resistance for some species, while making humans susceptible to viruses that use these ACE2 surfaces for binding, as does SARS-CoV-2.

Gamma rhythms in many brain regions, including the primary visual cortex (V1), are thought to play a role in information processing. Here, we report a surprising finding of 3 narrowband gamma rhythms in V1 that processed distinct spatial frequency (SF) signals and had different neural origins. The low gamma (LG; 25 to 40 Hz) rhythm was generated at the V1 superficial layer and preferred a higher SF compared with spike activity, whereas both the medium gamma (MG; 40 to 65 Hz), generated at the cortical level, and the high gamma HG; (65 to 85 Hz), originated precortically, preferred lower SF information. Furthermore, compared with the rates of spike activity, the powers of the 3 gammas had better performance in discriminating the edge and surface of simple objects. These findings suggest that gamma rhythms reflect the neural dynamics of neural circuitries that process different SF information in the visual system, which may be crucial for multiplexing SF information and synchronizing different features of an object.

Murcia, Chris Boutell</p>

The pandemic spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents an ongoing international health crisis. A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41°C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 replication. Utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) air–liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory tissue incubated at 40°C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry but refractory to viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of viral RNA replication and apical shedding of infectious virus. We identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the differential regulation of epithelial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that impact upon multiple pathways, including intracellular immune regulation, without disruption to general transcription or epithelium integrity. We present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in respiratory epithelia. Our data identify an important role for tissue temperature in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 independently of canonical interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defenses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multivariate analysis and characterization of low impact crime in Mexico City [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multivariate analysis is fast becoming a key instrument that can be used to address crimes or incidents. It may be helpful to assess government policies on crime prevention. Methods: To distinguish between the 25 official crime categories reported in Mexico City (Jan 2019 - Jun 2019), principal coordinates analysis was used to determine the quality of a characteristic in this context. This study used cluster analysis via K-means and Biplot based on time and location in terms of crime occurrence. Results: The results obtained from this preliminary analysis indicates that around 70% of crime occurrence is shown in the following boroughs: Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero, Benito Juárez, Álvaro Obregón, Coyoacán, and Miguel Hidalgo. Conclusion: There are two factors that contribute to the difficulties in crime analysis in Mexico City, namely, the lack of people’s trust in authorities and the insufficiency of tools for data analysis. The latter is an integral part in achieving justice for the victims of crimes because it impedes the process of observing patterns and predicting the perpetrators’ next actions, which may help in solving a number of types of crimes. It is then imperative for law enforcement to utilize data analysis tools that aid in identifying crime patterns and trends, such that the occurrences of crime show a downward trend and consequentially increase the people’s trust in law enforcement agencies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">COVID‐19 Vaccine Response in People with Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Four hundred seventy-three people with MS provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine history, medical, and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modeling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type, and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01–0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with the response to the vaccination. The vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group. ANN NEUROL 20219999:n/a–n/a</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Promise of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nucleic acid therapeutics have been attracting attention as novel drug discovery modalities for intractable diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, the results of a phase I/II study using the antisense oligonucleotides Tofersen to treat familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 mutation have been reported. Intrathecal Tofersen administration resulted in a 36% reduction in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another report described 2 patients with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 treated with an adeno-associated virus encoding a microRNA targeting superoxide dismutase 1. The first patient, who possessed the fast progressive mutant A5V, received a single intrathecal infusion. Although the patient died of respiratory arrest 16 months after treatment, autopsy findings showed a reduction of &gt;90% in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the spinal cord. Clinical trials on antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting other major amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causative genes, fused in sarcoma and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, are ongoing. To attenuate the pathology of TDP-43, strategies targeting regulators of TDP-43 (ataxin 2) and proteins downstream of TDP-43 (stathmin 2) by antisense oligonucleotides are being developed. The advent of nucleic acid therapeutics has enabled to specifically attack the molecules in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathological cascade, expanding the options for therapeutic targets.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Germline loss-of-function mutations in <i>DEPDC5</i>, and in its binding partners (<i>NPRL2/3</i>) of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) repressor GATOR1 complex, cause focal epilepsies and increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Here, we asked whether <i>DEPDC5</i> haploinsufficiency predisposes to primary cardiac defects that could contribute to SUDEP and therefore impact the clinical management of patients at high risk of SUDEP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical cardiac investigations were performed in 16 patients with pathogenic variants in <i>DEPDC5</i>, <i>NPRL2</i>, or <i>NPRL3</i>. Two novel <i>Depdc5</i> mouse strains, a human HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> strain and a <i>Depdc5</i> heterozygous knockout with a neuron-specific deletion of the second allele (<i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup>), were generated to investigate the role of <i>Depdc5</i> in SUDEP and cardiac activity during seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Holter, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic (ECG) examinations provided no evidence for altered clinical cardiac function in the patient cohort, of whom 3 <i>DEPDC5</i> patients succumbed to SUDEP and 6 had a family history of SUDEP. There was no cardiac injury at autopsy in a postmortem <i>DEPDC5</i> SUDEP case. The HA-tagged <i>Depdc5</i> mouse revealed expression of <i>Depdc5</i> in the brain, heart, and lungs. Simultaneous electroencephalographic–ECG records on <i>Depdc5</i>
<sup>c/−</sup> mice showed that spontaneous epileptic seizures resulting in a SUDEP-like event are not preceded by cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mouse and human data show neither structural nor functional cardiac damage that might underlie a primary contribution to SUDEP in the spectrum of <i>DEPDC5</i>-related epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:101–116</p>

                <p>We evaluated whether genetically elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with lower risk of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage (IA/SAH). We conducted a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Our primary analysis used the inverse-variance weighted method. In secondary analyses, we implemented the MR-PRESSO method, restricted our analysis to LDL-C–specific instruments, and performed multivariate MR. A 1-mmol/l increase in genetically instrumented LDL-C levels was associated with a 17% lower risk of IA/SAH (odds ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.73–0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Results remained consistent in secondary and multivariate analyses (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Our results provide evidence for an inverse causal relationship between LDL-C levels and risk of IA/SAH.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This observational cohort study aims to quantify disease burden over time, establish disease progression rates, and identify factors that may determine the disease course of Leigh syndrome.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy-two Leigh syndrome children who completed the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) at baseline at 3.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–7.6) and follow-up assessments at 7.5 years (IQR = 3.7–11.0) in clinics were enrolled. Eighty-two percent of this cohort had a confirmed genetic diagnosis, with pathogenic variants in the <i>MT-ATP6</i> and <i>SURF1</i> genes being the most common cause. The total NPMDS scores denoted mild (0–14), moderate (15–25), and severe (&gt;25) disease burden. Detailed clinical, neuroradiological, and molecular genetic findings were also analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median total NPMDS scores rose significantly (<i>Z</i> = −6.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of children with severe disease burden doubled (22% → 42%) over 2.6 years of follow-up. Poor function (especially mobility, self-care, communication, feeding, and education) and extrapyramidal features contributed significantly to the disease burden (<i>τ</i>
<sub>b</sub> ≈ 0.45–0.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). These children also deteriorated to wheelchair dependence (31% → 57%), exclusive enteral feeding (22% → 46%), and one-to-one assistance for self-care (25% → 43%) during the study period. Twelve children (17%) died after their last NPMDS scores were recorded. These children had higher follow-up NPMDS scores (disease burden; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and steeper increase in NPMDS score per annum (disease progression; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Other predictors of poor outcomes include <i>SURF1</i> gene variants (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and bilateral caudate changes on neuroimaging (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study has objectively defined the disease burden and progression of Leigh syndrome. Our analysis has also uncovered potential influences on the trajectory of this neurodegenerative condition. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:117–130</p>

                <p>This study was undertaken to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 causes a persistent central nervous system infection. SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody index and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were studied in cerebrospinal fluid following COVID-19. Cerebrospinal fluid was assessed between days 1 and 30 (n = 12), between days 31 and 90 (n = 8), or later than 90 days (post–COVID-19, n = 20) after COVID-19 diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all patients, and in none of the 20 patients with post–COVID-19 syndrome were intrathecally produced anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The absence of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid argues against a persistent central nervous system infection as a cause of neurological or neuropsychiatric post–COVID-19 syndrome.

Brain inflammation alters development through neuroinflammatory processes mediated by activation of homeostatic microglia toward a pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype. Investigating immune regulators of microglial activation is crucial to find effective strategies to prevent and treat WMI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ex vivo microglial cultures and a mouse model of WMI induced by perinatal inflammation (interleukin-1-beta [IL-1β] and postnatal days 1–5) were used to uncover and elucidate the role of microRNA-146b-5p in microglial activation and WMI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A specific reduction in vivo in microglia of <i>Dicer</i>, a protein required for microRNAs maturation, reduces pro-inflammatory activation of microglia and prevents hypomyelination in our model of WMI. Microglial miRNome analysis in the WMI model identified miRNA-146b-5p as a candidate modulator of microglial activation. Ex vivo microglial cell culture treated with the pro-inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to overexpression of immunomodulatory miRNA-146b-5p but its drastic reduction in the microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs). To increase miRNA-146b-5p expression, we used a 3DNA nanocarrier to deliver synthetic miRNA-146b-5p specifically to microglia. Enhancing microglial miRNA-146b-5p overexpression significantly decreased LPS-induced activation, downregulated IRAK1, and restored miRNA-146b-5p levels in EVs. In our WMI model, 3DNA miRNA-146b-5p treatment significantly prevented microglial activation, hypomyelination, and cognitive defect induced by perinatal inflammation.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>These findings support that miRNA-146b-5p is a major regulator of microglia phenotype and could be targeted to reduce the incidence and the severity of perinatal brain injuries and their long-term consequences. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:48–65</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative memory decline is an important consequence of anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the extent of resection may be a modifiable factor. This study aimed to define optimal resection margins for cognitive outcome while maintaining a high rate of postoperative seizure freedom.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study evaluated the resection extent on postoperative structural MRI using automated voxel-based methods and manual measurements in 142 consecutive patients with unilateral drug refractory TLE (74 left, 68 right TLE) who underwent standard ATLR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxel-wise analyses revealed that postsurgical verbal memory decline correlated with resections of the posterior hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, whereas larger resections of the fusiform gyrus were associated with worsening of visual memory in left TLE. Limiting the posterior extent of left hippocampal resection to 55% reduced the odds of significant postoperative verbal memory decline by a factor of 8.1 (95% CI 1.5–44.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Seizure freedom was not related to posterior resection extent, but to the piriform cortex removal after left ATLR. In right TLE, variability of the posterior extent of resection was not associated with verbal and visual memory decline or seizures after surgery.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of surgical resection is an independent and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and seizures after left ATLR. Adapting the posterior extent of left ATLR might optimize postoperative outcome, with reduced risk of memory impairment while maintaining comparable seizure-freedom rates. The current, more lenient, approach might be appropriate for right ATLR. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:131–144</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after recent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) aged ≥85 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individual patient data analysis from seven prospective stroke cohorts. We compared DOAC versus VKA treatment among patients with AF and recent stroke (&lt;3 months) aged ≥85 versus &lt;85 years. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause death. We used simple, adjusted, and weighted Cox regression to account for confounders. We calculated the net benefit of DOAC versus VKA by balancing stroke reduction against the weighted ICH risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 5,984 of 6,267 (95.5%) patients were eligible for analysis. Of those, 1,380 (23%) were aged ≥85 years and 3,688 (62%) received a DOAC. During 6,874 patient-years follow-up, the impact of anticoagulant type (DOAC versus VKA) on the hazard for the composite outcome did not differ between patients aged ≥85 (HR<sub>≥85y</sub> = 0.65, 95%-CI [0.52, 0.81]) and &lt; 85 years (HR<sub>&lt;85y</sub> = 0.79, 95%-CI [0.66, 0.95]) in simple (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.129), adjusted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.094) or weighted (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.512) models. Analyses on recurrent stroke, ICH and death separately were consistent with the primary analysis, as were sensitivity analyses using age dichotomized at 90 years and as a continuous variable. DOAC had a similar net clinical benefit in patients aged ≥85 (+1.73 to +2.66) and &lt; 85 years (+1.90 to +3.36 events/100 patient-years for ICH-weights 1.5 to 3.1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The favorable profile of DOAC over VKA in patients with AF and recent stroke was maintained in the oldest old. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:78–88</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Stratifying the Presymptomatic Phase of Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia by Serum NfL and pNfH: A Longitudinal Multicentre Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the presymptomatic stages of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) provide a unique chance to delay or even prevent neurodegeneration by early intervention, they remain poorly defined. Leveraging a large multicenter cohort of genetic FTD mutation carriers, we provide a biomarker-based stratification and biomarker cascade of the likely most treatment-relevant stage within the presymptomatic phase: the conversion stage.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed serum levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) in the Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI) cohort (n = 444), using single-molecule array technique. Subjects comprised 91 symptomatic and 179 presymptomatic subjects with mutations in the FTD genes <i>C9orf72</i>, <i>GRN</i>, or <i>MAPT</i>, and 174 mutation-negative within-family controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a biomarker cascade, NfL increase preceded the hypothetical clinical onset by 15 years and concurred with brain atrophy onset, whereas pNfH increase started close to clinical onset. The conversion stage was marked by increased NfL, but still normal pNfH levels, while both were increased at the symptomatic stage. Intra-individual change rates were increased for NfL at the conversion stage and for pNfH at the symptomatic stage, highlighting their respective potential as stage-dependent dynamic biomarkers within the biomarker cascade. Increased NfL levels and NfL change rates allowed identification of presymptomatic subjects converting to symptomatic disease and capture of proximity-to-onset. We estimate stage-dependent sample sizes for trials aiming to decrease neurofilament levels or change rates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood NfL and pNfH provide dynamic stage-dependent stratification and, potentially, treatment response biomarkers in presymptomatic FTD, allowing demarcation of the conversion stage. The proposed biomarker cascade might pave the way towards a biomarker-based precision medicine approach to genetic FTD. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:33–47</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Although autoimmunity has been postulated to be pathophysiologically important in SFN, few autoantibodies have been described. We aimed to identify autoantibodies associated with idiopathic SFN (iSFN) by a novel high-throughput protein microarray platform that captures autoantibodies expressed in the native conformational state.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera from 58 SFN patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were screened against &gt;1,600 immune-related antigens. Fluorescent unit readout and postassay imaging were performed, followed by composite data normalization and protein fold change (pFC) analysis. Analysis of an independent validation cohort of 33 SFN patients against the same 20 HCs was conducted to identify reproducible proteins in both cohorts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine autoantibodies were screened with statistical significance and pFC criteria in both cohorts, with at least 50% change in serum levels. Three proteins showed consistently high fold changes in main and validation cohorts: MX1 (FC = 2.99 and 3.07, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.003, <i>q</i> = 0.076), DBNL (FC = 2.11 and 2.16, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.009, <i>q</i> &lt; 0.003), and KRT8 (FC = 1.65 and 1.70, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.043, <i>q</i> &lt; 0.003). Further subgroup analysis into iSFN and SFN by secondary causes (secondary SFN) in the main cohort showed that MX1 is higher in iSFN compared to secondary SFN (FC = 1.61 vs 0.106, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel autoantibodies MX1, DBNL, and KRT8 are found in iSFN. MX1 may allow diagnostic subtyping of iSFN patients. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:66–77</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Perfusion Imaging Predicts Favorable Outcomes after Basilar Artery Thrombectomy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging identifies anterior circulation stroke patients who respond favorably to endovascular thrombectomy (ET), but its role in basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is unknown. We hypothesized that BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion (time to reach maximum concentration in seconds [Tmax] &gt; 10) would have a favorable response to ET compared to patients with more extensive regions involved.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of BAO patients with perfusion imaging prior to ET. We prespecified a Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS; 0–6 points), which quantified severe hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt; 10) in cerebellum (1 point/hemisphere), pons (2 points), and midbrain and/or thalamus (2 points). Patients were dichotomized into favorable (CAPS ≤ 3) and unfavorable (CAPS &gt; 3) groups. The primary outcome was a favorable functional outcome 90 days after ET (modified Rankin Scale = 0–3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three patients were included. CAPS ≤ 3 patients (87%) had a lower median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS; 12.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 7–22) compared to CAPS &gt; 3 patients (13%; 23, IQR = 19–36; <i>p</i> = 0.01). Reperfusion was achieved in 84% of all patients, with no difference between CAPS groups (<i>p</i> = 0.42). Sixty-four percent of reperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients had a favorable outcome compared to 8% of nonreperfused CAPS ≤ 3 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 21.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6–170; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No CAPS &gt; 3 patients had a favorable outcome, regardless of reperfusion. In a multivariate regression analysis, CAPS ≤ 3 was a robust independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjustment for reperfusion, age, and pre-ET NIHSS (OR = 39.25, 95% CI = 1.34–&gt;999, <i>p</i> = 0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion had a favorable response to reperfusion following ET. However, patients with more extensive regions of hypoperfusion in critical brain regions did not benefit from endovascular reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:23–32</p>

He fixated with the paretic left eye, which caused continuous activation of the left inferior rectus muscle to compensate for the left hypertropia. This can be seen as a hot spot (red) in the inferior medial left orbit. See Li and colleagues, pages 160–161 in this issue, for details.</p>

                The ability to detect and adapt to different levels of ambient light is critical for animal survival. Light detection is the basis of vision, but light also regulates eye development and drives several non-image-forming functions, including synchronizing circadian rhythms to the daily light/dark cycle, restricting pupils in response to changes in light intensity, and modulating mood in response to light. Until the early 2000s, these functions were thought to be solely mediated by ocular photoreceptors.

Phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of DDX5 by PAK5 enhances formation of a DDX5/Drosha/DGCR8 complex, thus promoting miR-10b processing posttranscriptionally, suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue for breast cancer treatment.

                Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of multiple oncogenic mutations. Here, we demonstrate that non-mutated genes function within a network of strong genetic interdependencies that are critical to the malignant state. Our network modeling methodology, TopNet, reveals a sparse topological gene network architecture, effectively pinpointing functionally relevant gene interactions.

                Duan et al. demonstrate extensive modifications of glycolytic enzymes in cancer and show that triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) Ser58 phosphorylation is significantly elevated in tumors. Blocking TPI Ser58 phosphorylation inhibits aerobic glycolysis, cancer cell growth, and metastasis. PRKACA directly phosphorylates TPI at Ser58, thereby enhancing glycolysis metabolism and tumor development.

                Marek et al. show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) from trypanosomes diverge from human HDACs. Notably, T. cruzi HDACs tcDAC1 and tcDAC2 are essential. tcDAC2 has structural features unobserved in human HDACs that promote specific interactions with inhibitors. Thus, targeting atypical HDACs from pathogens can lead to anti-parasitic strategies.

                Elimination of inhibitory synapses following excitotoxic insult reduces synaptic inhibition and elevates neuronal excitability. Garcia et al. reveal that excitotoxicity-induced inhibitory synapse disassembly occurs sequentially, in a stepwise manner, and involves alterations to GABAAR and gephyrin nanoscale synaptic architecture, which is driven by independent calcineurin and calpain signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mapping vestibular and visual contributions to angular head velocity tuning in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Head motion signals are critical for spatial navigation and visual perception. Hennestad et al. develop a technique for rotating mice under a two-photon microscope and find neurons tuned to head rotation speed in many cortical areas. This tuning depends on vestibular and visual input in an area-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish cranial neural crest reveals spatiotemporal regulation of lineage decisions during development</a></h4>

              
                Tatarakis et al. provide a single-cell transcriptomic timeline of cranial neural crest (NC) development in zebrafish and address long-standing questions surrounding the integration of NC cell migration and lineage specification. They find that lineages are specified mid-migration. These fate decisions correspond to shifts in Wnt signaling, and lineages rapidly segregate.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Brain connectivity inversely scales with developmental temperature in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Different developmental temperatures lead to differently wired brains and behavioral adaptation to the temperature at which a fly developed. Kiral et al. propose that evolution has selected for a Drosophila genome that can develop functional, but non-identical, brains through scalable synapse formation based on relative availability of synaptic partners.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Astroglial ER-mitochondria calcium transfer mediates endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic integration</a></h4>

              
                Serrat et al. demonstrate that mitochondria-associated CB1 (mtCB1) receptors determine endocannabinoid-dependent intracellular calcium signaling in astrocytes to promote synaptic integration. Upon endocannabinoid mobilization, mtCB1 receptors favor calcium transfer from ER to mitochondria through a specific molecular cascade involving the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, thereby shaping the dynamics of cytosolic calcium events.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion in cortical axons depends on the kinases SadA and SadB</a></h4>

              
                Di Meo et al. show that SadA/B kinases are required in cortical neurons for axon-specific mitochondrial dynamics. They regulate the balance of fission and fusion through the phosphorylation of tau downstream of Ankyrin B. The elongation of mitochondria after loss of SadA/B can be normalized by mild actin destabilization.

                Arguello et al. show that deletion of the mitochondrial protein ATAD3 in neurons leads to neuronal loss and death. The earliest phenotype is disruption of the mitochondrial inner membrane structure; OXPHOS complexes are affected later. ATAD3 is regularly spaced and has several interactors at the inner membrane, including CI subunits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hemodynamic molecular imaging of tumor-associated enzyme activity in the living brain</a></h4>

              
                Molecular imaging could have great utility for detecting, classifying, and guiding treatment of brain disorders, but existing probes offer limited capability for assessing relevant physiological parameters. Here, we describe a potent approach for noninvasive mapping of cancer-associated enzyme activity using a molecular sensor that acts on the vasculature, providing a diagnostic readout via local changes in hemodynamic image contrast. The sensor is targeted at the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an extracellular dipeptidase and clinically relevant biomarker of brain tumor biology. Optimal FAP sensor variants were identified by screening a series of prototypes for responsiveness in a cell-based bioassay. The best variant was then applied for quantitative neuroimaging of FAP activity in rats, where it reveals nanomolar-scale FAP expression by xenografted cells. The activated probe also induces robust hemodynamic contrast in nonhuman primate brain. This work thus demonstrates a potentially translatable strategy for ultrasensitive functional imaging of molecular targets in neuromedicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In silico-labeled ghost cytometry</a></h4>

              
                Characterization and isolation of a large population of cells are indispensable procedures in biological sciences. Flow cytometry is one of the standards that offers a method to characterize and isolate cells at high throughput. When performing flow cytometry, cells are molecularly stained with fluorescent labels to adopt biomolecular specificity which is essential for characterizing cells. However, molecular staining is costly and its chemical toxicity can cause side effects to the cells which becomes a critical issue when the cells are used downstream as medical products or for further analysis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput stain-free flow cytometry called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry which characterizes and sorts cells using machine-predicted labels. Instead of detecting molecular stains, we use machine learning to derive the molecular labels from compressive data obtained with diffractive and scattering imaging methods. By directly using the compressive ‘imaging’ data, our system can accurately assign the designated label to each cell in real time and perform sorting based on this judgment. With this method, we were able to distinguish different cell states, cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and subtypes of peripheral white blood cells using only stain-free modalities. Our method will find applications in cell manufacturing for regenerative medicine as well as in cell-based medical diagnostic assays in which fluorescence labeling of the cells is undesirable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary footprints of a cold relic in a rapidly warming world</a></h4>

              
                With accelerating global warming, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant adaptation to environmental change is increasingly urgent. Here we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus <i>Cochlearia </i>(Brassicaceae)<i>, </i>a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. <i>Cochlearia</i> rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche<i>.</i> Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proton transfer pathway in anion channelrhodopsin-1</a></h4>

              
                Anion channelrhodopsin from <i>Guillardia theta</i> (<i>Gt</i>ACR1) has Asp234 (3.2 Å) and Glu68 (5.3 Å) near the protonated Schiff base. Here, we investigate mutant <i>Gt</i>ACR1s (e.g., E68Q/D234N) expressed in HEK293 cells. The influence of the acidic residues on the absorption wavelengths was also analyzed using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach. The calculated protonation pattern indicates that Asp234 is deprotonated and Glu68 is protonated in the original crystal structures. The D234E mutation and the E68Q/D234N mutation shorten and lengthen the measured and calculated absorption wavelengths, respectively, which suggests that Asp234 is deprotonated in the wild-type <i>Gt</i>ACR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show that upon mutation of deprotonated Asp234 to asparagine, deprotonated Glu68 reorients toward the Schiff base and the calculated absorption wavelength remains unchanged. The formation of the proton transfer pathway via Asp234 toward Glu68 and the disconnection of the anion conducting channel are likely a basis of the gating mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Determinants shaping the nanoscale architecture of the mouse rod outer segment</a></h4>

              
                The unique membrane organization of the rod outer segment (ROS), the specialized sensory cilium of rod photoreceptor cells, provides the foundation for phototransduction, the initial step in vision. ROS architecture is characterized by a stack of identically shaped and tightly packed membrane disks loaded with the visual receptor rhodopsin. A wide range of genetic aberrations have been reported to compromise ROS ultrastructure, impairing photoreceptor viability and function. Yet, the structural basis giving rise to the remarkably precise arrangement of ROS membrane stacks and the molecular mechanisms underlying genetically inherited diseases remain elusive. Here, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) performed on native ROS at molecular resolution provides insights into key structural determinants of ROS membrane architecture. Our data confirm the existence of two previously observed molecular connectors/spacers which likely contribute to the nanometer-scale precise stacking of the ROS disks. We further provide evidence that the extreme radius of curvature at the disk rims is enforced by a continuous supramolecular assembly composed of peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and rod outer segment membrane protein 1 (ROM1) oligomers. We suggest that together these molecular assemblies constitute the structural basis of the highly specialized ROS functional architecture. Our Cryo-ET data provide novel quantitative and structural information on the molecular architecture in ROS and substantiate previous results on proposed mechanisms underlying pathologies of certain PRPH2 mutations leading to blindness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mimicry can drive convergence in structural and light transmission features of transparent wings in Lepidoptera</a></h4>

              
                Müllerian mimicry is a positive interspecific interaction, whereby co-occurring defended prey species share a common aposematic signal. In Lepidoptera, aposematic species typically harbour conspicuous opaque wing colour patterns with convergent optical properties among co-mimetic species. Surprisingly, some aposematic mimetic species have partially transparent wings, raising the questions of whether optical properties of transparent patches are also convergent, and of how transparency is achieved. Here, we conducted a comparative study of wing optics, micro and nanostructures in neotropical mimetic clearwing Lepidoptera, using spectrophotometry and microscopy imaging. We show that transparency, as perceived by predators, is convergent among co-mimics in some mimicry rings. Underlying micro- and nanostructures are also sometimes convergent despite a large structural diversity. We reveal that while transparency is primarily produced by microstructure modifications, nanostructures largely influence light transmission, potentially enabling additional fine-tuning in transmission properties. This study shows that transparency might not only enable camouflage but can also be part of aposematic signals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of brilliant iridescent feather nanostructures</a></h4>

              
                The brilliant iridescent plumage of birds creates some of the most stunning color displays known in the natural world. Iridescent plumage colors are produced by nanostructures in feathers and have evolved in diverse birds. The building blocks of these structures—melanosomes (melanin-filled organelles)—come in a variety of forms, yet how these different forms contribute to color production across birds remains unclear. Here, we leverage evolutionary analyses, optical simulations, and reflectance spectrophotometry to uncover general principles that govern the production of brilliant iridescence. We find that a key feature that unites all melanosome forms in brilliant iridescent structures is thin melanin layers. Birds have achieved this in multiple ways: by decreasing the size of the melanosome directly, by hollowing out the interior, or by flattening the melanosome into a platelet. The evolution of thin melanin layers unlocks color-producing possibilities, more than doubling the range of colors that can be produced with a thick melanin layer and simultaneously increasing brightness. We discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of iridescent structures in birds and propose two evolutionary paths to brilliant iridescence.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">New Caledonian crows keep ‘valuable’ hooked tools safer than basic non-hooked tools</a></h4>

              
                The temporary storage and re-use of tools can significantly enhance foraging efficiency. New Caledonian crows in one of our study populations use two types of stick tools – hooked and non-hooked – which differ in raw material, manufacture costs, and foraging performance. Using a large sample of wild-caught, temporarily captive New Caledonian crows, we investigated experimentally whether individuals prefer one tool type over the other when given a choice and whether they take better care of their preferred tools between successive episodes of use, safely storing them underfoot or in nearby holes. Crows strongly preferred hooked stick tools made from <i>Desmanthus virgatus</i> stems over non-hooked stick tools. Importantly, this preference was also reflected in subsequent tool-handling behaviour, with subjects keeping hooked stick tools safe more often than non-hooked stick tools sourced from leaf litter. These results suggest that crows ‘value’ hooked stick tools, which are both costlier to procure and more efficient to use, more than non-hooked stick tools. Results from a series of control treatments suggested that crows altered their tool ‘safekeeping’ behaviour in response to a combination of factors, including tool type and raw material. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use safekeeping behaviour as a proxy for assessing how non-human animals value different tool types, establishing a novel paradigm for productive cross-taxonomic comparisons.

                We have used phase-contrast X-ray tomography to characterize the                    three-dimensional (3d) structure of cardiac tissue from patients who succumbed                    to Covid-19. By extending conventional histopathological examination by a third                    dimension, the delicate pathological changes of the vascular system of severe                    Covid-19 progressions can be analyzed, fully quantified and compared to other                    types of viral myocarditis and controls. To this end, cardiac samples with a                    cross section of 3:5mm were scanned at a laboratory setup as well as at a                    parallel beam setup at a synchrotron radiation facility. The vascular network                    was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net),                    trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels,                    concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were                    observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis,                    also confirmed by high resolution cone beam X-ray tomography and scanning                    electron microscopy. Furthermore, we implemented a fully automated analysis of                    the tissue structure in form of shape measures based on the structure tensor.                    The corresponding distributions show that the histopathology of Covid-19 differs                    from both influenza and typical coxsackie virus myocarditis.

                Complexes of IL-2 and JES6-1 mAb (IL-2/JES6) provide strong sustained IL-2 signal selective for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells and thus they potently expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells. IL-2/JES6 are effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in protecting against rejection of pancreatic islet allografts. However, we found that IL-2/JES6 also dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS-mediated shock in C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrate here that this phenomenon is dependent on endogenous IFN-γ and T cells, as it is not manifested in IFN-γ deficient and nude mice, respectively. Administration of IL-2/JES6 leads to the emergence of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in various organs, particularly in the liver. IL-2/JES6 also increase counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in the blood and the spleen with higher sensitivity to LPS in terms of TNF-α production and induce expression of CD25 in these cells. These findings indicate safety issue for potential use of IL-2/JES6 or similar IL-2-like immunotherapeutics.

                Background and Objectives: Positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid-ligands recently gained interest for evaluating white matter (WM) pathology. Here, we investigated the neurobiological underpinnings of the amyloid-PET signal in the WM using free water (FW) diffusion MRI in a mixed cohort of small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Methods: We included data from two large cohort imaging studies, including MITNEC-C6 with moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden and ADNI-2 with mild-to-moderate WMH burden, covering the spectrum of cognitively normal to dementia. Subjects underwent diffusion MRI, 18F-AV45 amyloid-PET, and cognitive testing. We calculated WM diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). In addition, we applied a bi-tensor diffusion MRI model that differentiates between extracellular (FW fraction) and tissue-specific (FW-adjusted FA) compartments of the WM. We tested associations of all diffusion metrics with 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH vs. normal-appearing WM (NAWM), and with cognition. We further performed partial-least-square analysis to investigate how the diffusion metrics as well as age, sex, education, WMH volume, and cortical 18F-AV45 SUVR covary with WM 18F-AV45 SUVR. Results: 18F-AV45 SUVR was significantly lower in regions of WMH compared to NAWM (t=25.08, P<0.0001, n=115 subjects). Within WMH, lower 18F-AV45 SUVR was associated with higher FW ({beta}=-0.36{+/-}0.13, P=0.005) and lower FA ({beta}=+0.24{+/-}0.12, P=0.046), but not with the tissue-specific metric FW-adjusted FA. Partial-least-square analysis further confirmed that FW had the most influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in regions of WMH. In contrast, FW-adjusted FA had more influence on 18F-AV45 SUVR in NAWM. Last, correlation with cognitive impairment was higher for FW than FW-adjusted FA, both in regions of WMH (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.40{+/-}0.13, P=0.003; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.14{+/-}0.09, P=0.11) and NAWM (MMSE: {beta}FW=-0.30{+/-}0.11, P=0.01; {beta}FW-adjustedFA=0.21{+/-}0.09, P=0.02. Conclusion: In a cohort representative of the more common AD population, reduced amyloid-PET uptake in WM lesions may largely reflect the appearance of extracellular FW, while changes in NAWM may associate with tissue-specific damage. Ultimately, our findings may support FW and amyloid-PET as markers of WM abnormalities in SVD and AD.

                It is well-recognized that primary cilia regulate embryonic neurodevelopment, but little is known about their roles in postnatal neurodevelopment. The striatum pyramidal (SP) of hippocampal CA1 consists of superficial and deep sublayers, however, it is not well understood how early- and late-born pyramidal neurons position to two sublayers postnatally. Here we show that neuronal primary cilia emerge after CA1 pyramidal cells have reached SP, but before final neuronal positioning. The axonemes of primary cilia of early-born neurons point to the stratum oriens (SO), whereas late-born neuronal cilia orient toward the stratum radiatum (SR), reflecting an inside-out lamination pattern. Neuronal primary cilia in SP undergo marked changes in morphology and orientation from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P14, concurrent with pyramidal cell positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers and with neuronal maturation. Transgenic overexpression of Arl13B, a protein regulating ciliogenesis, not only elongates primary cilia and promotes earlier cilia protrusion, but also affects centriole positioning and cilia orientation in SP. The centrioles of late-born neurons migrate excessively to cluster at SP bottom before primary cilia protrusion and a reverse movement back to the main SP. Similarly, this pull-back movement of centriole/cilia is also identified on late-born cortical pyramidal neurons, although early- and late-born cortical neurons display the same cilia orientation. Together, this study provides the first evidence demonstrating that late-born pyramidal neurons exhibit a reverse movement for cell positioning, and primary cilia regulate pyramidal neuronal positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers in the hippocampus.

                Animals exhibit diverse behavioral responses, such as exploration and avoidance, to novel cues in the environment. However, it remains unclear how dopamine neuron-related novelty responses influence behavior. Here, we characterized dynamics of novelty exploration using multi-point tracking (DeepLabCut) and behavioral segmentation (MoSeq). Novelty elicits a characteristic sequence of behavior, starting with investigatory approach and culminating in object engagement or avoidance. Dopamine in the tail of striatum (TS) suppresses engagement, and dopamine responses were predictive of individual variability in behavior. Behavioral dynamics and individual variability were explained by a novel reinforcement learning (RL) model of threat prediction, in which behavior arises from a novelty-induced initial threat prediction (akin to shaping bonus), and a threat prediction that is learned through dopamine-mediated threat prediction errors. These results uncover an algorithmic similarity between reward- and threat-related dopamine sub-systems.

                The primary role of microglia in the maintenance of brain homeostasis is to respond to disturbances in the microenvironment. In this study, we cultured murine neonatal microglia and activated them with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and benzoyl ATP (bzATP) to characterize changes in the transcriptome in response to various in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxins. Activation by bzATP, an agonist of purinergic receptors, induces a transient wave of transcriptional changes. However, a long-lasting transcriptional profile affecting thousands of genes occurs only following a combination of bzATP and LPS. This profile is dominated by a coordinated induction of cytokines (e.g., IL1-alpha; and IL1-beta), chemokines, and their direct regulators. Many of these inflammatory-related genes are up-regulated by several orders of magnitude. We identified the TNF-alpha and NF-kB pathways as the principal hubs for signaling of interleukin and chemokine induction in this cell system. We propose that primary microglia under controlled activation paradigms can be used for testing reagents that could attenuate their activated state. Such a microglial system could serve as a model for changes occurring in the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised functional neurocartography of the Aplysia buccal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                A major limitation of large-scale neuronal recordings is the difficulty in locating the same neuron in different subjects, referred to as the "correspondence" issue. This issue stems, at least in part, from the lack of a unique feature that unequivocally identifies each neuron. One promising approach to this problem is the functional neurocartography framework developed by Frady et al. (2016), in which neurons are identified by a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm using a combination of multiple selected features. Here, the framework was adapted to the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Multiple features were derived from neuronal activity during motor pattern generation, responses to peripheral nerve stimulation, and the spatial properties of each cell. The feature set was optimized based on its potential usefulness in discriminating neurons from each other, and then used to match putatively homologous neurons across subjects with the functional neurocartography software. A matching method was developed based on a cyclic matching algorithm that allows for unsupervised extraction of groups of neurons, thereby enhancing scalability of the analysis. Cyclic matching was also used to automate the selection of high-quality matches, which allowed for unsupervised implementation of the machine learning algorithm. This study paves the way for investigating the roles of both well-characterized and previously uncharacterized neurons in Aplysia, as well as helps to adapt this framework to other systems.

                Optical microscopy has enabled in vivo monitoring of brain structures and functions with high spatial resolution. However, the strong optical scattering in turbid brain tissue and skull impedes the observation of microvasculature and neuronal structures at large depth. Herein, we proposed a strategy to overcome the influence induced by the high scattering effect of both skull and brain tissue via the combination of skull optical clearing (SOC) technique and thee-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM). The Visible-NIR-II compatible Skull Optical Clearing Agents (VNSOCA) we applied reduced the skull scattering and water absorption in long wavelength by refractive index matching and H2O replacement to D2O respectively. 3PM with the excitation in the 1300-nm window reached 1.5 mm cerebrovascular imaging depth in cranial window. Combining the two advanced technologies together, we achieved so far the largest cerebrovascular imaging depth of 1 mm and neuronal imaging depth of >700 m through intact mouse skull. Dual-channel through-skull imaging of both brain vessels and neurons was also successfully realized, giving an opportunity of non-invasively monitoring the deep brain structures and functions at single-cell level simultaneously.

                Interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) has been observed during social interactions and involves various factors, such as familiarity with the partner and type of social activity. A previous study has shown that face-to-face interactions in pairs of strangers increase IBS. However, it is unclear whether this can be observed when the nature of the interacting partners is different. Herein, we aimed to extend these findings to pairs of acquaintances. Neural activity in the frontal and temporal regions was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. Participants played an ultimatum game that required virtual economic exchange in two experimental settings: the face-to-face and face-blocked conditions. Random pair analysis confirmed whether IBS was induced by social interaction. Contrary to the aforementioned study, our results did not show any cooperative behavior or task-induced IBS increase. Conversely, the random pair analysis results revealed that the pair-specific IBS was significant only in the task condition at the left and right superior frontal, middle frontal, orbital superior frontal, right superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri. Our results revealed that face-to-face interaction in acquainted pairs did not increase IBS and supported the idea that IBS is affected by "with whom we interact and how."

                To date, there is a consensus that there are at least two neuronal populations in the non-human primate (NHP) external globus pallidus (GPe): the low- and high-frequency discharge (LFD and HFD) neurons. Nevertheless, almost all NHP physiological studies have neglected the functional importance of LFD neurons. This study examined the discharge features of these two GPe neuronal subpopulations recorded in four NHPs engaged in a classical conditioning task with cues predicting reward, neutral and aversive outcomes. The results show that LFD neurons tended to burst, encoded the salience of behavioral cues, and exhibited correlated spiking activity. By contrast, the HFD neurons tended to pause, encoded cue valence, and exhibited uncorrelated spiking activity. Overall, these findings point to the dichotomic organization of the NHP GPe which is likely to be critical to the implementation of normal basal ganglia functions and computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The adolescent pattern of sleep spindle development revealed by HD-EEG polisomnography</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are developmentally relevant cortical oscillatory patterns; however, they have mostly been studied by considering the entire spindle frequency range (11 to 15 Hz) without a distinction between the functionally and topographically different slow and fast spindles, using relatively few electrodes and analysing wide age-ranges. Here, we employ HD-EEG polysomnography in three age-groups between 12 to 20 years of age, with an equal distribution between the two genders, and analyse the adolescent developmental pattern of the four major parameters of slow and fast sleep spindles. Most of our findings corroborate those very few previous studies that also make a distinction between slow and fast spindles in their developmental analysis. We find spindle frequency increasing with age, although spindle density change is not obvious in our study. We confirm the declining tendencies for amplitude and duration, although within narrower, more specific age-windows than previously. Spindle frequency seems to be higher in females in the oldest age-group. Based on the pattern of our findings, we suggest that HD-EEG, specifically targeting slow and fast spindle ranges and relatively narrow age-ranges would advance the understanding of both adolescent development and the functional relevance of sleep spindles in general.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional signature in microglia isolated from an Alzheimers disease mouse model treated with scanning ultrasound</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Intracranial scanning ultrasound combined with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS+MB) transiently opens the blood-brain barrier and reduces amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD). This has been accomplished, at least in part, through the activation of microglial cells; however, their response to the SUS treatment is only incompletely understood. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and APP23 mice were subjected to SUS+MB, using non-SUS+MB-treated mice as sham controls. After 48 hours, the APP23 mice were injected with methoxy-XO4 to label Abeta aggregates, followed by microglial isolation into XO4+ and XO4- populations using flow cytometry. Both XO4+ and XO4- cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and their transcriptome was analyzed through a bioinformatics pipeline. Results: The transcriptomic analysis of the microglial cells revealed a clear segregation depending on genotype (AD model versus WT mice), as well as treatment (SUS+MB versus sham) and Abeta internalization (XO4+ versus XO4- microglia). Differential gene expression analysis detected 278 genes that were significantly changed by SUS+MB in the XO4+ cells (248 up/30 down) and 242 in XO- cells (225 up/17 down). Not surprisingly given previous findings of increased phagocytosis of plaques following SUS+MB, the pathway analysis highlighted that the treatment induced an enrichment in genes related to the phagosome pathway in XO4+ microglia; however, when comparing SUS+MB to sham, the analysis revealed an enrichment in genes involved in the cell cycle in both the XO4+ and XO4- microglial population. Conclusion: Our data provide a comprehensive analysis of microglia in an AD mouse model subjected to ultrasound treatment as a function of Abeta internalization, one of the defining hallmarks of AD. Several differentially expressed genes are highlighted, pointing to an ultrasound-induced activation of cell cycle mechanisms in microglial cells isolated from APP23 mice treated with SUS+MB.

                While in vivo calcium imaging makes it possible to record activity in defined neuronal populations with cellular resolution, optogenetics allows selective manipulation of neural activity. Recently, these two tools have been combined to stimulate and record neural activity at the same time, but current approaches often rely on two-photon microscopes that are difficult to use in freely moving animals. To address these limitations, we have developed a new integrated system combining a one-photon endoscope and a digital micromirror device for simultaneous calcium imaging and precise optogenetic photo-stimulation with near cellular resolution (Miniscope with All-optical Patterned Stimulation and Imaging, MAPSI). Using this highly portable system in freely moving mice, we were able to image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway while simultaneously activating any neuron of choice in the field of view, or to synthesize arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns of photo-stimulation. We could also select neurons based on their relationship with behavior and recreate the behavior by mimicking the natural neural activity with photo-stimulation. MAPSI thus provides a powerful tool for interrogation of neural circuit function in freely moving animals.

                Working memory enables incorporation of recent experience into subsequent decision-making. This processing recruits both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where neurons encode task cues, rules and outcomes. However, precisely which information is carried when, and by which neurons, remains unclear. Using population decoding of activity in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampal CA1, we confirm that mPFC populations lead in maintaining sample information across delays of an operant non-match to sample task, despite individual neurons firing only transiently. During sample encoding, distinct mPFC subpopulations joined distributed CA1-mPFC cell assemblies hallmarked by 4-5Hz rhythmic modulation; CA1-mPFC assemblies re-emerged during choice episodes, but were not 4-5Hz modulated. Delay-dependent errors arose when attenuated rhythmic assembly activity heralded collapse of sustained mPFC encoding; pharmacological disruption of CA1-mPFC assembly rhythmicity impaired task performance. Our results map component processes of memory-guided decisions onto heterogeneous CA1-mPFC subpopulations and the dynamics of physiologically distinct, distributed cell assemblies.

                The visual system processes stimuli over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales, with individual neurons receiving input from tens of thousands of neurons whose dynamics range from milliseconds to tens of seconds. This poses a challenge to create models that both accurately capture visual computations and are mechanistically interpretable. Here we present a model of salamander retinal ganglion cell spiking responses recorded with a multielectrode array that captures natural scene responses and slow adaptive dynamics. The model consists of a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) modified to include local recurrent synaptic dynamics taken from a linear-nonlinear-kinetic (LNK) model cite{ozuysal2012linking}. We presented alternating natural scenes and uniform field white noise stimuli designed to engage slow contrast adaptation. To overcome difficulties fitting slow and fast dynamics together, we first optimized all fast spatiotemporal parameters, then separately optimized recurrent slow synaptic parameters. The resulting full model reproduces a wide range of retinal computations and is mechanistically interpretable, having internal units that correspond to retinal interneurons with biophysically modeled synapses. This model allows us to study the contribution of model units to any retinal computation, and examine how long-term adaptation changes the retinal neural code for natural scenes through selective adaptation of retinal pathways.
