              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22768">Emergence of Human-Like Attention in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers: an eye-tracking study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.22768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models of visual attention have been proposed so far. Traditional bottom-up models, like saliency models, fail to replicate human gaze patterns, and deep gaze prediction models lack biological plausibility due to their reliance on supervised learning. Vision Transformers (ViTs), with their self-attention mechanisms, offer a new approach but often produce dispersed attention patterns if trained with supervised learning. This study explores whether self-supervised DINO (self-DIstillation with NO labels) training enables ViTs to develop attention mechanisms resembling human visual attention. Using video stimuli to capture human gaze dynamics, we found that DINO-trained ViTs closely mimic human attention patterns, while those trained with supervised learning deviate significantly. An analysis of self-attention heads revealed three distinct clusters: one focusing on foreground objects, one on entire objects, and one on the background. DINO-trained ViTs offer insight into how human overt attention and figure-ground separation develop in visual perception.

                arXiv:2303.05174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) approximate the dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)? Arguments in classical mean-field theory based on laws of large numbers provide a positive answer when each neuron in the network has many "duplicates", i.e. other neurons with almost perfectly correlated inputs. Using a disordered network model that guarantees the absence of duplicates, we show that duplicate-free SNNs can converge to RNNs, thanks to the concentration of measure phenomenon. This result reveals a general mechanism underlying the emergence of rate-based dynamics in large SNNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13669">Theta and/or alpha? Neural oscillational substrates for dynamic inter-brain synchrony during mother-child cooperation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17300">Neural association between musical features and shared emotional perception while movie-watching: fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings research on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22320">Nanoscale Connectomics Annotation Standards Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.22320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of large-scale, high-resolution datasets from Electron Microscopy (EM) and X-ray Microtomography (XRM) lies in their ability to reveal neural structures and synaptic connectivity, which is critical for understanding the brain. Effectively managing these complex and rapidly increasing datasets will enable new scientific insights, facilitate querying, and support secondary use across the neuroscience community. However, without effective neurodata standards that permit use of these data across multiple systems and workflows, these valuable and costly datasets risk being underutilized especially as they surpass petascale levels. These standards will promote data sharing through accessible interfaces, allow researchers to build on each other's work, and guide the development of tools and capabilities that are interoperable. Herein we outline a standards framework for creating and managing annotations originating and derived from high-resolution volumetric imaging and connectomic datasets, focusing on ensuring Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) practices. The goal is to enhance collaborative efforts, boost the reliability of findings, and enable comparative analysis across growing datasets of different species and modalities. We have formed a global working group with academic and industry partners in the high-resolution volumetric data generation and analysis community, focused on identifying gaps in current EM and XRM data pipelines, and refining outlines and platforms for standardizing EM and XRM methods. This focus considers existing and past community approaches and includes examining neuronal entities, biological components, and associated metadata, while emphasizing adaptability and fostering collaboration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14427">Control when confidence is costly</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.14427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of stochastic control that accounts for computational costs of inference. Past studies identified efficient coding without control, or efficient control that neglects the cost of synthesizing information. Here we combine these concepts into a framework where agents rationally approximate inference for efficient control. Specifically, we study Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with an added internal cost on the relative precision of the posterior probability over the world state. This creates a trade-off: an agent can obtain more utility overall by sacrificing some task performance, if doing so saves enough bits during inference. We discover that the rational strategy that solves the joint inference and control problem goes through phase transitions depending on the task demands, switching from a costly but optimal inference to a family of suboptimal inferences related by rotation transformations, each misestimate the stability of the world. In all cases, the agent moves more to think less. This work provides a foundation for a new type of rational computations that could be used by both brains and machines for efficient but computationally constrained control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12927">Emergent mechanisms for long timescales depend on training curriculum and affect performance in memory tasks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2309.12927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the brain and in silico excel at solving tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons (single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale). However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve $N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights and $\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple $N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and are able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.

                arXiv:2410.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The value of brain-inspired neuromorphic computers critically depends on our ability to program them for relevant tasks. Currently, neuromorphic hardware often relies on machine learning methods adapted from deep learning. However, neuromorphic computers have potential far beyond deep learning if we can only harness their energy efficiency and full computational power. Neuromorphic programming will necessarily be different from conventional programming, requiring a paradigm shift in how we think about programming. This paper presents a conceptual analysis of programming within the context of neuromorphic computing, challenging conventional paradigms and proposing a framework that aligns more closely with the physical intricacies of these systems. Our analysis revolves around five characteristics that are fundamental to neuromorphic programming and provides a basis for comparison to contemporary programming methods and languages. By studying past approaches, we contribute a framework that advocates for underutilized techniques and calls for richer abstractions to effectively instrument the new hardware class.

                arXiv:2410.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods autonomously discover high-accuracy neural network architectures, outperforming manually crafted ones. However, The NAS methods require high computational costs due to the high dimension search space and the need to train multiple candidate solutions. This paper introduces LCoDeepNEAT, an instantiation of Lamarckian genetic algorithms, which extends the foundational principles of the CoDeepNEAT framework. LCoDeepNEAT co-evolves CNN architectures and their respective final layer weights. The evaluation process of LCoDeepNEAT entails a single epoch of SGD, followed by the transference of the acquired final layer weights to the genetic representation of the network. In addition, it expedites the process of evolving by imposing restrictions on the architecture search space, specifically targeting architectures comprising just two fully connected layers for classification. Our method yields a notable improvement in the classification accuracy of candidate solutions throughout the evolutionary process, ranging from 2% to 5.6%. This outcome underscores the efficacy and effectiveness of integrating gradient information and evolving the last layer of candidate solutions within LCoDeepNEAT. LCoDeepNEAT is assessed across six standard image classification datasets and benchmarked against eight leading NAS methods. Results demonstrate LCoDeepNEAT's ability to swiftly discover competitive CNN architectures with fewer parameters, conserving computational resources, and achieving superior classification accuracy compared to other approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22657">Automatic programming via large language models with population self-evolution for dynamic job shop scheduling problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.22657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heuristic dispatching rules (HDRs) are widely regarded as effective methods for solving dynamic job shop scheduling problems (DJSSP) in real-world production environments. However, their performance is highly scenario-dependent, often requiring expert customization. To address this, genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP) have been extensively used for automatic algorithm design. Nevertheless, these approaches often face challenges due to high randomness in the search process and limited generalization ability, hindering the application of trained dispatching rules to new scenarios or dynamic environments. Recently, the integration of large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms has opened new avenues for prompt engineering and automatic algorithm design. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs in automatic HDRs design, this paper proposes a novel population self-evolutionary (SeEvo) method, a general search framework inspired by the self-reflective design strategies of human experts. The SeEvo method accelerates the search process and enhances exploration capabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed SeEvo method outperforms GP, GEP, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning methods, and more than 10 common HDRs from the literature, particularly in unseen and dynamic scenarios.

                arXiv:2410.22730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A property of a recurrent neural network (RNN) is called \emph{extensional} if, loosely speaking, it is a property of the function computed by the RNN rather than a property of the RNN algorithm. Many properties of interest in RNNs are extensional, for example, robustness against small changes of input or good clustering of inputs. Given an RNN, it is natural to ask whether it has such a property. We give a negative answer to the general question about testing extensional properties of RNNs. Namely, we prove a version of Rice's theorem for RNNs: any nontrivial extensional property of RNNs is undecidable.

                arXiv:2410.22374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern computer systems store vast amounts of personal data, enabling advances in AI and ML but risking user privacy and trust. For privacy reasons, it is desired sometimes for an ML model to forget part of the data it was trained on. This paper presents a new approach to machine unlearning using forgetting neural networks (FNN). FNNs are neural networks with specific forgetting layers, that take inspiration from the processes involved when a human brain forgets. While FNNs had been proposed as a theoretical construct, they have not been previously used as a machine unlearning method. We describe four different types of forgetting layers and study their properties. In our experimental evaluation, we report our results on the MNIST handwritten digit recognition and fashion datasets. The effectiveness of the unlearned models was tested using Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Successful experimental results demonstrate the great potential of our proposed method for dealing with the machine unlearning problem.

                arXiv:2410.23126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal memorization capacity of modern Hopfield models and Kernelized Hopfield Models (KHMs), a transformer-compatible class of Dense Associative Memories. We present a tight analysis by establishing a connection between the memory configuration of KHMs and spherical codes from information theory. Specifically, we treat the stored memory set as a specialized spherical code. This enables us to cast the memorization problem in KHMs into a point arrangement problem on a hypersphere. We show that the optimal capacity of KHMs occurs when the feature space allows memories to form an optimal spherical code. This unique perspective leads to: (i) An analysis of how KHMs achieve optimal memory capacity, and identify corresponding necessary conditions. Importantly, we establish an upper capacity bound that matches the well-known exponential lower bound in the literature. This provides the first tight and optimal asymptotic memory capacity for modern Hopfield models. (ii) A sub-linear time algorithm $\mathtt{U}\text{-}\mathtt{Hop}$+ to reach KHMs' optimal capacity. (iii) An analysis of the scaling behavior of the required feature dimension relative to the number of stored memories. These efforts improve both the retrieval capability of KHMs and the representation learning of corresponding transformers. Experimentally, we provide thorough numerical results to back up theoretical findings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in lakes requires a comprehensive study of phenological patterns across ecosystems, highlighting the need for precise selection of interactions amongst external factors and internal physical-chemical-biological variables. This paper presents the Multi-population Cognitive Evolutionary Search (MCES), a novel evolutionary algorithm for complex feature interaction selection problems. MCES allows models within every population to evolve adaptively, selecting relevant feature interactions for different lake types and tasks. Evaluated on diverse lakes in the Midwestern USA, MCES not only consistently produces accurate predictions with few observed labels but also, through gene maps of models, reveals sophisticated phenological patterns of different lake types, embodying the innovative concept of "AI from nature, for nature".

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09688">A Theory of Synaptic Neural Balance: From Local to Global Order</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.09688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of synaptic neural balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given regularizer, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. Gradient descent on the error function alone does not converge in general to a balanced state, where every neuron is in balance, even when starting from a balanced state. However, gradient descent on the regularized error function ought to converge to a balanced state, and thus network balance can be used to assess learning progress. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. Simulations show that balancing neurons prior to learning, or during learning in alternation with gradient descent steps, can improve learning speed and final performance.

                arXiv:2406.01309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.

                arXiv:2410.03530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there is growing demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling, with State Space Models (SSMs) proving to be effective for long sequence tasks. To further reduce energy consumption, SSMs can be adapted to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using spiking functions. However, current spiking-formalized SSMs approaches still rely on float-point matrix-vector multiplication during inference, undermining SNNs' energy advantage. In this work, we address the efficiency and performance challenges of long sequence learning in SNNs simultaneously. First, we propose a decoupled reset method for parallel spiking neuron training, reducing the typical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model's training time from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L\log L)$, effectively speeding up the training by $6.57 \times$ to $16.50 \times$ on sequence lengths $1,024$ to $32,768$. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that parallel computation with a reset mechanism is implemented achieving equivalence to its sequential counterpart. Secondly, to capture long-range dependencies, we propose a Parallel Resonate and Fire (PRF) neuron, which leverages an oscillating membrane potential driven by a resonate mechanism from a differentiable reset function in the complex domain. The PRF enables efficient long sequence learning while maintaining parallel training. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed spike-driven architecture using PRF achieves performance comparable to Structured SSMs (S4), with two orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption, outperforming Transformer on Long Range Arena tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to improve the energy efficiency of machine learning models, as they naturally implement event-driven computations while avoiding expensive multiplication operations. In this paper, we develop a hardware-software co-optimisation strategy to port software-trained deep neural networks (DNN) to reduced-precision spiking models demonstrating fast and accurate inference in a novel event-driven CMOS reconfigurable spiking inference accelerator. Experimental results show that a reduced-precision Resnet-18 and VGG-11 SNN models achieves classification accuracy within 1% of the baseline full-precision DNN model within 8 spike timesteps. We also demonstrate an FPGA prototype implementation of the spiking inference accelerator with a throughput of 38.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) consuming 1.54 Watts on PYNQ-Z2 FPGA. This corresponds to 0.6 GOPS per processing element and 2.25,GOPS/DSP slice, which is 2x and 4.5x higher utilisation efficiency respectively compared to the state-of-the-art. Our co-optimisation strategy can be employed to develop deep reduced precision SNN models and port them to resource-efficient event-driven hardware accelerators for edge applications.

Abstract: We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a model zoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across model zoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to model zoos of different architecture not seen during training. We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.

Abstract: Deep learning models face persistent challenges in training, particularly due to internal covariate shift and label shift.

Multi-mode normalization techniques mitigate these limitations but struggle with computational demands when handling diverse Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to multi-mode normalization that leverages prior knowledge to improve neural network representations. Our method organizes data into predefined structures, or "contexts", prior to training and normalizes based on these contexts, with two variants: Context Normalization (CN) and Context Normalization - Extended (CN-X). When contexts are unavailable, we introduce Adaptive Context Normalization (ACN), which dynamically builds contexts in the latent space during training. Across tasks in image classification, domain adaptation, and image generation, our methods demonstrate superior convergence and performance.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial intelligence, predominantly utilizing spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. Significant advancements have been made in SNN-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. However, neuromorphic computing for the medical imaging domain remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce EG-SpikeFormer, an SNN architecture tailored for clinical tasks that incorporates eye-gaze data to guide the model's attention to the diagnostically relevant regions in medical images. Our developed approach effectively addresses shortcut learning issues commonly observed in conventional models, especially in scenarios with limited clinical data and high demands for model reliability, generalizability, and transparency. Our EG-SpikeFormer not only demonstrates superior energy efficiency and performance in medical image prediction tasks but also enhances clinical relevance through multi-modal information alignment. By incorporating eye-gaze data, the model improves interpretability and generalization, opening new directions for applying neuromorphic computing in healthcare.

	<p>Introduction: Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) can indicate affective states&amp;amp;mdash;including psychosocial stress&amp;amp;mdash;in mice and rats. However, stress-induced USV changes could be confounded by laboratory experimental variables such as the type of behavioral stress paradigm, the elicitation method, rodent strain, etc. We sought to provide a review of the current literature to delineate how psychosocial stress-altered rodent USVs may be affected by factors of age, sex, strain, species, elicitation paradigm, and stressor. Methods: We used PubMed, Scopus (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and the following Web of Science (Clarivate) databases: Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, Science Citation Index-Expanded, and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The studies identified by our search strategy were independently screened by two authors with the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, in English, reported original data, and described USV in response to stress in rats or mice. The data extracted included USV acoustic parameters (mean peak frequency and mean amplitude (loudness)), details of the stress and USV elicitation paradigms, rodent species, age, and sex variables. Results: The following screening of 5309 titles/abstracts and 687 full-text articles revealed 148 articles. Footshock (20%), cold exposure (14%), and maternal separation (23.5%) were the most commonly used stress paradigms (duration and type of stressor varied across studies), with the total number of USV calls being the most commonly reported acoustic outcome. In rats, 121 articles described stress-altered USVs, while 25 studies reported the same in mice, and two reported multiple rodent species (rats and mice, alongside other rodent species such as gerbils). With respect to stress-altered USV changes with age, mice and rats increase USV rates after birth, with a peak around 6 to 10 days, and decrease USVs until weanling age. Of the five studies that reported sex-related differences in stress-induced USVs, females had an increased number of calls and lower average peak frequency in response to stress when compared to males. Only two to four studies reported strain-related differences in stress-induced vocalizations in rats and mice, respectively. Conclusions: The data from this review lay the groundwork for better understanding rodent USVs in response to psychosocial stress with effects of elicitation paradigm, stressor, age, and sex.</p>

	<p>Background: When integrating visual and somatosensory processing into the subjective postural vertical using the Romberg test, patients with hemiplegic can be sorted into either post-stroke or pushers with unilateral spatial neglect (USN). This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of the integrated processing of the integrated subjective postural vertical (ISPV) with open or closed eyes in patients with hemiplegic and/or pusher with USN. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 91 patients with hemiplegic and 45 with pusher and USN. The outcomes included the ratio and sum of SPV with the eyes closed and open. Statistical analyses were performed using the parametric and/or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, or chi-square test after the Shapiro&amp;amp;ndash;Wilk test. Results: The outcomes in the 91 patients with hemiplegic were as follows: moderate-to-severe ISPV with ratio, 1.64&amp;amp;deg;; ISPV sum (ISPVS), 9.41&amp;amp;deg;. The outcomes in the 45 patients with pusher and USN were as follows: moderate-to-severe, ISPV: 1.35&amp;amp;deg;, and ISPVS: 13.96&amp;amp;deg;. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data or ISPV. However, the number of patients with pusher syndrome was significantly higher in the ISPVS group than in stroke patients with hemiplegic. Conclusions: Adaptation occurs by integrating sensory modalities, and the pusher behavior in patients with USN is characterized by the specific pathophysiology of a two-modality disorder with visual and somatosensory deficits. This study provides key insights into the pathophysiological characteristics of patients with pusher syndrome and USN.</p>

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (18%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                <p>Experimental evidence showed that an increase in intracellular chloride concentration <f></f> caused by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) input can promote epileptic firing activity, but the actual mechanisms remain elusive. Here in this theoretical work, we show that influx of chloride and concomitant bicarbonate ion <f></f> efflux upon GABA receptor activation can induce epileptic firing activity by transition of GABA from inhibition to excitation. We analyzed the intrinsic property of neuron firing states as a function of <f></f>. We found that as <f></f> increases, the system exhibits a saddle&ndash;node bifurcation, above which the neuron exhibits a spectrum of intensive firing, periodic bursting interrupted by depolarization block (DB) state, and eventually a stable DB through a Hopf bifurcation. We demonstrate that only GABA stimuli together with <f></f> efflux can switch GABA's effect to excitation which leads to a series of seizure-like events (SLEs). Exposure to a low <f></f> can drive neurons with high concentrations of <f></f> downward to lower levels of <f></f>, during which it could also trigger SLEs depending on the exchange rate with the bath. Our analysis and simulation results show how the competition between GABA stimuli-induced accumulation of <f></f> and <f></f> application-induced decrease of <f></f> regulates the neuron firing activity, which helps to understand the fundamental ionic dynamics of SLE.</p>

                <p>Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We found that in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, a set of neurons, which we call CL062, previously shown to mediate male aggression also mediate female aggression. These neurons elicit aggression acutely and without the presence of a target. Although the same set of actions is elicited in males and females, the overall behavior is sexually dimorphic. The CL062 neurons do not express <I>fruitless</I>, a gene required for sexual dimorphism in flies, and expressed by most other neurons important for controlling fly aggression. Connectomic analysis in a female electron microscopy dataset suggests that these neurons have limited connections with <I>fruitless</I> expressing neurons that have been shown to be important for aggression and signal to different descending neurons. Thus, CL062 is part of a monomorphic circuit for aggression that functions parallel to the known dimorphic circuits.</p>

                <p>Odor information arrives first in the main olfactory bulb and is then broadcasted to the olfactory cortices and striatum. Downstream regions have unique cellular and connectivity architectures that may generate different coding patterns to the same odors. To reveal region-specific response features, tuning and decoding of single-unit populations, we recorded responses to the same odors under the same conditions across regions, namely, the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPC), and the olfactory tubercle of the ventral striatum (OT), of awake male mice. We focused on chemically closely related aldehydes that still create distinct percepts. The MOB had the highest decoding accuracy for aldehydes and was the only region encoding chemical similarity. The MOB had the highest fraction of inhibited responses and narrowly tuned odor-excited responses in terms of timing and odor selectivity. Downstream, the interconnected AON and aPC differed in their response patterns to the same stimuli. While odor-excited responses dominated the AON, the aPC had a comparably high fraction of odor-inhibited responses. Both cortices share a main output target that is the MOB. This prompted us to test if the two regions convey also different net outputs. Aldehydes activated AON terminals in the MOB as a bulk signal but inhibited those from the aPC. The differential cortical projection responses generalized to complex odors. In summary, olfactory regions reveal specialized features in their encoding with AON and aPC differing in their local computations, thereby generating inverse net centrifugal and intercortical outputs.</p>

                <p>Harmonics are an integral part of music, speech, and vocalizations of animals. Since the rest of the auditory environment is primarily made up of nonharmonic sounds, the auditory system needs to perceptually separate the above two kinds of sounds. In mice, harmonics, generally with two-tone components (two-tone harmonic complexes, TTHCs), form an important component of vocal communication. Communication by pups during isolation from the mother and by adult males during courtship elicits typical behaviors in female mice&mdash;dams and adult courting females, respectively. Our study shows that the processing of TTHC is specialized in mice providing neural basis for perceptual differences between tones and TTHCs and also nonharmonic sounds. Investigation of responses in the primary auditory cortex (Au1) from in vivo extracellular recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to TTHCs exhibit enhancement, suppression, or no-effect with respect to tones. Irrespective of neuron type, harmonic enhancement is maximized, and suppression is minimized when the fundamental frequencies (<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB>) match the neuron's best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>). Sex-specific processing of TTHC is evident from differences in the distributions of neurons&rsquo; best frequency (BF) and best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>) in single units, differences in harmonic suppressed cases re-BF<SUB>0</SUB>, independent of neuron types, and from pairwise noise correlations among excitatory and parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, TTHCs elicit a higher response compared with two-tone nonharmonics in females, but not in males. Thus, our study shows specialized neural processing of TTHCs over tones and nonharmonics, highlighting local network specialization among different neuronal types.</p>

                <p>It is well established that holding information in working memory (WM) elicits sustained stimulus-specific patterns of neural activity. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence for a distinct class of neural activity that tracks the number of individuated items in working memory, independent of the type of visual features stored. We present two EEG studies of young adults of both sexes that provide robust evidence for a signal tracking the number of individuated representations in working memory, regardless of the specific feature values stored. In Study 1, subjects maintained either colors or orientations across separate blocks in a single session. We found near-perfect generalization of the load signal between these two conditions, despite being able to simultaneously decode which feature had been voluntarily stored. In Study 2, participants attended to two features with very distinct cortical representations: color and motion coherence. We again found evidence for a neural load signal that robustly generalized across these distinct visual features, even though cortically disparate regions process color and motion coherence. Moreover, representational similarity analysis provided converging evidence for a content-independent load signal, while simultaneously showing that unique variance in EEG activity tracked the specific features that were stored. We posit that this load signal reflects a content-independent "pointer" operation that binds objects to the current context while parallel but distinct neural signals represent the features that are stored for each item in memory.</p>

                <p>In demanding listening situations, a listener's motivational state may affect their cognitive investment. Here, we aim to delineate how domain-specific sensory processing, domain-general neural alpha power, and pupil size as a proxy for cognitive investment encode influences of motivational state under demanding listening. Participants (male and female) performed an auditory gap-detection task while the pupil size and the magnetoencephalogram were simultaneously recorded. Task demand and a listener's motivational state were orthogonally manipulated through changes in gap duration and monetary-reward prospect, respectively. Whereas task difficulty impaired performance, reward prospect enhanced it. The pupil size reliably indicated the modulatory impact of an individual's motivational state. At the neural level, the motivational state did not affect auditory sensory processing directly but impacted attentional postprocessing of an auditory event as reflected in the late evoked-response field and alpha-power change. Both pregap pupil dilation and higher parietal alpha power predicted better performance at the single-trial level. The current data support a framework wherein the motivational state acts as an attentional top&ndash;down neural means of postprocessing the auditory input in challenging listening situations.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives a direct projection from retinal ganglion cells. In primates, it remains unknown if the same ganglion cells also supply the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this issue, a double-label experiment was performed in two male macaques. The animals fixated a target while injection sites were scouted in the superior colliculus by recording and stimulating with a tetrode. Once suitable sites were identified, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 488 was injected via an adjacent micropipette. In a subsequent acute experiment, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 555 was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus at matching retinotopic locations. After a brief survival period, ganglion cells were examined in retinal flatmounts. The percentage of double-labeled cells varied locally, depending on the relative efficiency of retrograde transport by each tracer and the precision of retinotopic overlap of injection sites in each target nucleus. In counting boxes with extensive overlap, 76&ndash;98% of ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus were double labeled. Cells projecting to the superior colliculus constituted 4.0&ndash;6.7% of the labeled ganglion cell population. In one particularly large zone, there were 5,746 cells labeled only by CTB-AF555, 561cells double labeled by CTB-AF555 and CTB-AF488, but no cell labeled only by CTB-AF488. These data indicate that retinal input to the macaque superior colliculus arises from a collateral axonal branch supplied by ~5% of the ganglion cells that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Surprisingly, there exist no ganglion cells that project exclusively to the SC.</p>

                <p>Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been repeatedly implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision-making processes. Although two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are coactivated under states of arousal, they engage in distinct circuits and modulatory roles. However, the specific role of each neuromodulator in decision-making, in particular the exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff, remains unclear. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of these two catecholamine systems in regulating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision-making task is needed. Here, we ran male and female mice in a restless two-armed bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol) and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine on exploration. Increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulatory effect of beta-noradrenergic receptor activity on exploration was mediated by sex. Reinforcement learning model parameters suggested that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation affected exploration via sensitivity to outcome. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the exploration&ndash;exploitation transition are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.</p>

                <p>The capabilities of the human ear are remarkable. We can normally detect acoustic stimuli down to a threshold sound-pressure level of 0&nbsp;dB (decibels) at the entrance to the external ear, which elicits eardrum vibrations in the picometer range. From this threshold up to the onset of pain, 120&nbsp;dB, our ears can encompass sounds that differ in power by a trillionfold. The comprehension of speech and enjoyment of music result from our ability to distinguish between tones that differ in frequency by only 0.2%. All these capabilities vanish upon damage to the ear's receptors, the mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells. Each cochlea, the auditory organ of the inner ear, contains some 16,000 such cells that are frequency-tuned between ~20&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second) and 20,000&nbsp;Hz. Remarkably enough, hair cells do not simply capture sound energy: they can also exhibit an active process whereby sound signals are amplified, tuned, and scaled. This article describes the active process in detail and offers evidence that its striking features emerge from the operation of hair cells on the brink of an oscillatory instability&mdash;one example of the critical phenomena that are widespread in physics.</p>

                <p>Neuroinflammation can positively influence axon regeneration following injury in the central nervous system. Inflammation promotes the release of neurotrophic molecules and stimulates intrinsic proregenerative molecular machinery in neurons, but the detailed mechanisms driving this effect are not fully understood. We evaluated how microRNAs are regulated in retinal neurons in response to intraocular inflammation to identify their potential role in axon regeneration. We found that miR-383-5p is downregulated in retinal ganglion cells in response to zymosan-induced intraocular inflammation. MiR-383-5p downregulation in neurons is sufficient to promote axon growth in vitro, and the intravitreal injection of a miR-383-5p inhibitor into the eye promotes axon regeneration following optic nerve crush. MiR-383-5p directly targets ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor components, and miR-383-5p inhibition sensitizes adult retinal neurons to the outgrowth-promoting effects of CNTF. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CNTF treatment is sufficient to reduce miR-383-5p levels in neurons, constituting a positive-feedback module, whereby initial CNTF treatment reduces miR-383-5p levels, which then disinhibits CNTF receptor components to sensitize neurons to the ligand. Additionally, miR-383-5p inhibition derepresses the mitochondrial antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) which was required for the proregenerative effects associated with miR-383-5p loss-of-function in vitro. We have thus identified a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates neuronal CNTF sensitivity in neurons and a new molecular signaling module that promotes inflammation-induced axon regeneration.</p>

                <p>GABAergic inhibitory interneurons comprise many subtypes that differ in their molecular, anatomical, and functional properties. In mouse visual cortex, they also differ in their modulation with an animal&rsquo;s behavioral state, and this state modulation can be predicted from the first principal component (PC) of the gene expression matrix. Here, we ask whether this link between transcriptome and state-dependent processing generalizes across species. To this end, we analysed seven single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets from mouse, human, songbird, and turtle forebrains. Despite homology at the level of cell types, we found clear differences between transcriptomic PCs, with greater dissimilarities between evolutionarily distant species. These dissimilarities arise from two factors: divergence in gene expression within homologous cell types and divergence in cell-type abundance. We also compare the expression of cholinergic receptors, which are thought to causally link transcriptome and state modulation. Several cholinergic receptors predictive of state modulation in mouse interneurons are differentially expressed between species. Circuit modelling and mathematical analyses suggest conditions under which these expression differences could translate into functional differences.</p>

                <p>Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel technique for noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). TUS delivered in a theta (5&nbsp;Hz) burst pattern (tbTUS) induces plasticity in the human primary motor cortex (M1) for 30&ndash;60&nbsp;min, showing promise for therapeutic development. Metaplasticity refers to activity-dependent changes in neural functions governing synaptic plasticity; depotentiation is the reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) by a subsequent protocol with no effect alone. Metaplasticity can enhance plasticity induction and clinical efficacy of NIBS protocols. In our study, we compared four NIBS protocol combinations to investigate metaplasticity on tbTUS in humans of either sex. We delivered four interventions: (1) sham continuous theta burst stimulation with 150 pulses (cTBS150) followed by real tbTUS (tbTUS only), (2) real cTBS150 followed by sham tbTUS (cTBS only), (3) real cTBS150 followed by real tbTUS (metaplasticity), and (4) real tbTUS followed by real cTBS150 (depotentiation). We measured motor-evoked potential amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-interval intracortical facilitation before and up to 90&nbsp;min after plasticity intervention. Plasticity effects lasted at least 60&nbsp;min longer when tbTUS was primed with cTBS150 compared with tbTUS alone. Plasticity was abolished when cTBS150 was delivered after tbTUS. cTBS150 alone had no significant effect. No changes in M1 intracortical circuits were observed. Plasticity induction by tbTUS can be modified in manners consistent with homeostatic metaplasticity and depotentiation. This substantiates evidence that tbTUS induces LTP-like processes and suggests that metaplasticity can be harnessed in the therapeutic development of TUS.</p>

                Introduction Pediatric meningiomas are rare tumors originating from the meninges’ arachnoid cap cells, representing a small fraction of all meningiomas. The clinical presentation of pediatric meningiomas varies widely depending on their location within the central nervous system. We report a case of pediatric spinal meningioma revealed by gait disturbance. We emphasize clinical and imaging features, as well as therapeutic management of spinal meningiomas. Case presentation We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with a one-year history of chronic thoracic back pain, worsening gait disturbances, and difficulty walking. Neurological examination revealed a spastic gait with increased muscle tone and bilateral pyramidal syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a posterior intradural extramedullary mass at the T6-T7 level, causing dorsal spinal cord compression. The patient underwent complete resection of the tumor, and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a WHO grade I psammomatous spinal meningioma. Conclusion This case highlights the clinical and imaging characteristics of spinal meningiomas in pediatric patients. MRI remains the gold standard for diagnostic imaging, effectively narrowing down differential diagnoses. However, a definitive diagnosis requires histological examination. The primary therapeutic approach for pediatric meningiomas is surgical resection.

                The utilization of zein and gum arabic has grown in an attempt to formulate wall materials based on protein–polysaccharide complexes. This mixture provides a versatile delivery system for hydrophilic (guava leaf extract, GLE) or lipophilic (fish oil, FO) bioactive compounds, and it can be used as an edible film-forming polymer. This study was undertaken to characterize FO-containing edible films that were double-layered with a film containing GLE. Modified zein and gum arabic solutions (MG complex) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1.5 (v/v), adjusted to pH 5, added with glycerol (20% of the complex) and FO (5% of the complex), and finally adjusted to pH 5. This was prepared as the bottom/lower layer. The upper/active layer was prepared by mixing MG complex, glycerol, and GLE (1, 3, and 5% w/v of the complex). The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in GLE were 15.81 mg GAE/g extract and 6.99 mg QE/g extract, respectively. The IC50 of the DPPH radical scavenging activity of GLE was 26.86 ppm with antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli of 9.83 and 12.55 mm. The total plate counts of double-layered films containing GLE were retained below 3 log CFU/g during 28-day storage. The peroxide values of these films were dimmed for no more than 9.08 meq/kg sample on day 28 of storage. Thickness (872.00-971.67 μm), water vapor transmission rate (12.99-17.04 g/m2/day), tensile strength (1.56-2.02 kPa), elongation at break (61.53-75.41%), glass transition (52.74-57.50°C), melting peak (131.59-142.35°C), inhibition against B. subtilis (33.67-40.58 mm), and inhibition against E. coli (2.05-9.04 mm) were obtained by double-layered films. GLE can be successfully incorporated into the active layer of a double-layer film to improve its characteristics while significantly slowing down the microbial contamination and oxidation rate. MG complex and FO can also contribute to the performance of the edible film.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-106/v3?src=rss">Comparison of the efficacy of aescin and diclofenac sodium in the management of postoperative sequelae and their effect on salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar: a randomize</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Faith and belief systems impact the emotional as well as immunological states of believers in ways that we are just beginning to understand. However, the clinical implications of prior studies are limited. The aim of the HEALING (Hospital-based Ecumenical and Linguistic Immuno-NeuroloGic) study is to examine immunological and neurological changes in hospitalized patients after meeting with a chaplain coupled with the study of biblical readings. Methods Hospitalized patients were pre-screened to identify those who were most in need of a spiritual intervention. A passage from the Bible was read to them during a meeting with the chaplain at bedside (n = 20) or in the chapel (n = 18). No meeting occurred in the randomized control group (n = 19). Blood samples were obtained 30 min prior and 60 min after the meeting to measure white blood cell (WBC) count, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, IgG, and complement 3 (C3). A subgroup of the visited patients was subjected to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during which they listened to an audiotape of readings of the same biblical passage (n = 21). Results Immunological changes were not significant. Conversely, a significant (pfwe = 0.003) correlation was observed between lymphocyte changes and activation of the angular gyrus (left BA39) during fMRI, a brain area involved in word recognition. Conclusions This article contributes to the relevant literature by helping to create a realistic picture of the possibilities of neuroimmune modulation in clinical practice. Compared to healthy volunteers, the extent of short-term neuroimmunomodulation becomes narrower in a clinical setting. Although limited by the sample size and cohort study design, the findings suggest that the depth of psycho-immunological changes could depend on the degree to which the chaplain’s main message is understood.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-935/v2?src=rss">Data on selfـــefficacy  and its sources during the COVID-19 crisis:  A Saudi auditor’s perspective [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Auditors during COVID-19 experienced an unprecedented situation, in which normal audit activities were difficult to conduct. Moreover, COVID-19 forced auditors to introduce a new audit approach, “remote auditing,” which was not common in most audit firms and required the adoption of more advanced technologies. Overall, auditors during the COVID-19 pandemic needed both cognitive and technical factors to deliver high-quality audits. Despite these challenges, research on how auditors deal with these issues is limited, presenting an intriguing area of study. Methods This dataset provides insights into Saudi auditors’ experience and beliefs regarding audit activities during COVID-19. Through an online survey, researchers collected data from 193 of 417 registered auditors with the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). The survey assessed auditors’ self-efficacy in conducting audits during the pandemic and explored its sources and potential moderating factors. Specifically, the dataset includes responses to eight items related to self-efficacy, 19 items covering four common sources of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological/emotional states), and six items assessing virtual audit competency. Additionally, the dataset contains demographic information that is valuable for researchers analyzing the relationship between auditor self-efficacy, its sources, and other influencing factors. Conclusions Overall, the dataset included in this study may serve a broader audience and be useful in improving several stakeholders’ understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on auditors and how auditors assess their ability to adapt to COVID-19 consequences. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the need for auditors to adapt to new circumstances and adopt innovative approaches during challenging times, thereby ensuring the delivery of high-quality audits.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1299/v1?src=rss">A causality investigation into stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in the Indian stock market [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

                <p>by Gaspard Oliviers, Rafal Bogacz, Alexander Meulemans</p>

It has been suggested that the brain employs probabilistic generative models to optimally interpret sensory information. This hypothesis has been formalised in distinct frameworks, focusing on explaining separate phenomena. On one hand, classic predictive coding theory proposed how the probabilistic models can be learned by networks of neurons employing local synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, neural sampling theories have demonstrated how stochastic dynamics enable neural circuits to represent the posterior distributions of latent states of the environment. These frameworks were brought together by variational filtering that introduced neural sampling to predictive coding. Here, we consider a variant of variational filtering for static inputs, to which we refer as Monte Carlo predictive coding (MCPC). We demonstrate that the integration of predictive coding with neural sampling results in a neural network that learns precise generative models using local computation and plasticity. The neural dynamics of MCPC infer the posterior distributions of the latent states in the presence of sensory inputs, and can generate likely inputs in their absence. Furthermore, MCPC captures the experimental observations on the variability of neural activity during perceptual tasks. By combining predictive coding and neural sampling, MCPC can account for both sets of neural data that previously had been explained by these individual frameworks.

                <p>by Alessio Andronico, Juliette Paireau, Simon Cauchemez</p>

Seasonal influenza causes significant annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. In France, it is estimated that, on average, 2 million individuals consult their GP for influenza-like-illness (ILI) every year. Traditionally, mathematical models used for epidemic forecasting can either include parameters capturing the infection process (mechanistic or compartmental models) or rely on time series analysis approaches that do not make mechanistic assumptions (statistical or phenomenological models). While the latter make extensive use of past epidemic data, mechanistic models are usually independently initialized in each season. As a result, forecasts from such models can contain trajectories that are vastly different from past epidemics. We developed a mechanistic model that takes into account epidemic data from training seasons when producing forecasts. The parameters of the model are estimated via a first particle filter running on the observed data. A second particle filter is then used to produce forecasts compatible with epidemic trajectories from the training set. The model was calibrated and tested on 35 years’ worth of surveillance data from the French Sentinelles Network, representing the weekly number of patients consulting for ILI over the period 1985–2019. Our results show that the new method improves upon standard mechanistic approaches. In particular, when retrospectively tested on the available data, our model provides increased accuracy for short-term forecasts (from one to four weeks into the future) and peak timing and intensity. Our new approach for epidemic forecasting allows the integration of key strengths of the statistical approach into the mechanistic modelling framework and represents an attempt to provide accurate forecasts by making full use of the rich surveillance dataset collected in France since 1985.

                <p>by Hannah Gordon, Zachary T. Schafer, Cody J. Smith</p>

The overproduction of cells and subsequent production of debris is a universal principle of neurodevelopment. Here, we show an additional feature of the developing nervous system that causes neural debris—promoted by the sacrificial nature of embryonic microglia that irreversibly become phagocytic after clearing other neural debris. Described as long-lived, microglia colonize the embryonic brain and persist into adulthood. Using transgenic zebrafish to investigate the microglia debris during brain construction, we identified that unlike other neural cell types that die in developmental stages after they have expanded, necroptosis-dependent microglial debris is prevalent when microglia are expanding in the zebrafish brain. Time-lapse imaging of microglia demonstrates that this debris is cannibalized by other microglia. To investigate features that promote microglia death and cannibalism, we used time-lapse imaging and fate-mapping strategies to track the lifespan of individual developmental microglia. These approaches revealed that instead of embryonic microglia being long-lived cells that completely digest their phagocytic debris, once most developmental microglia in zebrafish become phagocytic they eventually die, including ones that are cannibalistic. These results establish a paradox—which we tested by increasing neural debris and manipulating phagocytosis—that once most microglia in the embryo become phagocytic, they die, create debris, and then are cannibalized by other microglia, resulting in more phagocytic microglia that are destined to die.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-107/v5?src=rss">Does the impact of medical publications vary by disease indication and publication type? An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not app</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

                Yan et al. find that SARS-CoV-2 with the spike-E484D substitution can infect cells without the ACE2 receptor, relying instead on TMEM106B and heparan sulfate. However, ACE2-independent infection is only observed in cell cultures and does not occur in mice, indicating that this mutation is unlikely to substantially increase disease severity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96161">Neurons enhance blood–brain barrier function via upregulating claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression due to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor secretion</a></h4>

              
                Blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents neurotoxins from entering central nervous system. We aimed to establish and characterize an <i>in vitro</i> triple co-culture BBB model consisting of brain endothelial cells hCMEC/D3, astrocytoma U251 cells, and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Co-culture of SH-SY5Y and U251 cells markedly enhanced claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression in hCMEC/D3 cells, accompanied by increased transendothelial electrical resistance and decreased permeability. Conditioned medium (CM) from SH-SY5Y cells (S-CM), U251 cells (U-CM), and co-culture of SH-SY5Y and U251 cells (US-CM) also promoted claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels in S-CM and US-CM were significantly higher than CMs from hCMEC/D3 and U-CM. Both GDNF and US-CM upregulated claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression, which were attenuated by anti-GDNF antibody and GDNF signaling inhibitors. GDNF increased claudin-5 expression via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 and MAPK/ERK pathways. Meanwhile, GDNF promoted VE-cadherin expression by activating PI3K/AKT/ETS1 and MAPK/ERK/ETS1 signaling. The roles of GDNF in BBB integrity were validated using brain-specific <i>Gdnf</i> silencing mice. The developed triple co-culture BBB model was successfully applied to predict BBB permeability. In conclusion, neurons enhance BBB integrity by upregulating claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expression through GDNF secretion and established triple co-culture BBB model may be used to predict drugs’ BBB permeability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92085">PKCδ is an activator of neuronal mitochondrial metabolism that mediates the spacing effect on memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Relevance-based selectivity and high energy cost are two distinct features of long-term memory (LTM) formation that warrant its default inhibition. Spaced repetition of learning is a highly conserved cognitive mechanism that can lift this inhibition. Here, we questioned how the spacing effect integrates experience selection and energy efficiency at the cellular and molecular levels. We showed in <i>Drosophila</i> that spaced training triggers LTM formation by extending over several hours an increased mitochondrial metabolic activity in neurons of the associative memory center, the mushroom bodies (MBs). We found that this effect is mediated by PKCδ, a member of the so-called ‘novel PKC’ family of enzymes, which uncovers the critical function of PKCδ in neurons as a regulator of mitochondrial metabolism for LTM. Additionally, PKCδ activation and translocation to mitochondria result from LTM-specific dopamine signaling on MB neurons. By bridging experience-dependent neuronal circuit activity with metabolic modulation of memory-encoding neurons, PKCδ signaling binds the cognitive and metabolic constraints underlying LTM formation into a unified gating mechanism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90976">Transformation of valence signaling in a mouse striatopallidal circuit</a></h4>

              
                The ways in which sensory stimuli acquire motivational valence through association with other stimuli is one of the simplest forms of learning. Although we have identified many brain nuclei that play various roles in reward processing, a significant gap remains in understanding how valence encoding transforms through the layers of sensory processing. To address this gap, we carried out a comparative investigation of the mouse anteromedial olfactory tubercle (OT), and the ventral pallidum (VP) - 2 connected nuclei of the basal ganglia which have both been implicated in reward processing. First, using anterograde and retrograde tracing, we show that both D1 and D2 neurons of the anteromedial OT project primarily to the VP and minimally elsewhere. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we then investigated how the identity of the odor and reward contingency of the odor are differently encoded by neurons in either structure during a classical conditioning paradigm. We find that VP neurons robustly encode reward contingency, but not identity, in low-dimensional space. In contrast, the OT neurons primarily encode odor identity in high-dimensional space. Although D1 OT neurons showed larger responses to rewarded odors than other odors, consistent with prior findings, we interpret this as identity encoding with enhanced contrast. Finally, using a novel conditioning paradigm that decouples reward contingency and licking vigor, we show that both features are encoded by non-overlapping VP neurons. These results provide a novel framework for the striatopallidal circuit in which a high-dimensional encoding of stimulus identity is collapsed onto a low-dimensional encoding of motivational valence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92344">Whole blood transcriptional profiles and the pathogenesis of tuberculous meningitis</a></h4>

              
                Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are common, primarily due to inflammatory response to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and determine the best predictors of death, utilizing whole-blood RNA sequencing from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. Four hub genes—<i>MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C</i>, and <i>CD4</i>—were strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering insights for potential therapeutic targets alongside a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99173">PRR adjuvants restrain high stability peptides presentation on APCs</a></h4>

              
                Adjuvants can affect APCs function and boost adaptive immune responses post-vaccination. However, whether they modulate the specificity of immune responses, particularly immunodominant epitope responses, and the mechanisms of regulating antigen processing and presentation remain poorly defined. Here, using overlapping synthetic peptides, we screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post-vaccination with different adjuvants and found that the adjuvants altered the antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. MHC-II immunopeptidomes demonstrated that the peptide repertoires presented by APCs were significantly altered by the adjuvants. Unexpectedly, no novel peptide presentation was detected after adjuvant treatment, whereas peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in the control group were missing after adjuvant stimulation, particularly in the MPLA- and CpG-stimulated groups. The low-stability peptide present in the adjuvant groups effectively elicited robust T-cell responses and formed immune memory. Collectively, our results suggest that adjuvants (MPLA and CpG) inhibit high-stability peptide presentation instead of revealing cryptic epitopes, which may alter the specificity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dominant epitope responses. The capacity of adjuvants to modify peptide–MHC (pMHC) stability and antigen-specific T-cell immunodominant epitope responses has fundamental implications for the selection of suitable adjuvants in the vaccine design process and epitope vaccine development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96592">Rab11 suppresses neuronal stress signaling by localizing dual leucine zipper kinase to axon terminals for protein turnover</a></h4>

              
                Dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) mediates multiple neuronal stress responses, and its expression levels are constantly suppressed to prevent excessive stress signaling. We found that Wallenda (Wnd), the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of DLK, is highly enriched in the axon terminals of <i>Drosophila</i> sensory neurons in vivo and that this subcellular localization is necessary for Highwire-mediated Wnd protein turnover under normal conditions. Our structure-function analysis found that Wnd palmitoylation is essential for its axon terminal localization. Palmitoylation-defective Wnd accumulated in neuronal cell bodies, exhibited dramatically increased protein expression levels, and triggered excessive neuronal stress responses. Defective intracellular transport is implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Comprehensive dominant-negative Rab protein screening identified Rab11 as an essential factor for Wnd localization in axon terminals. Consequently, <i>Rab11</i> loss-of-function increased the protein levels of Wnd and induced neuronal stress responses. Inhibiting Wnd activity significantly ameliorated neuronal loss and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling triggered by <i>Rab11</i> loss-of-function. Taken together, these suggest that DLK proteins are constantly transported to axon terminals for protein turnover and a failure of such transport can lead to neuronal loss. Our study demonstrates how subcellular protein localization is coupled to protein turnover for neuronal stress signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99150">Elucidating ATP’s role as solubilizer of biomolecular aggregate</a></h4>

              
                Proteins occurring in significantly high concentrations in cellular environments (over 100 mg/ml) and functioning in crowded cytoplasm, often face the prodigious challenges of aggregation which are the pathological hallmark of aging and are critically responsible for a wide spectrum of rising human diseases. Here, we combine a joint-venture of complementary wet-lab experiment and molecular simulation to discern the potential ability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as solubilizer of protein aggregates. We show that ATP prevents both condensation of aggregation-prone intrinsically disordered protein Aβ40 and promotes dissolution of preformed aggregates. Computer simulation links ATP’s solubilizing role to its ability to modulate protein’s structural plasticity by unwinding protein conformation. We show that ATP is positioned as a superior biological solubilizer of protein aggregates over traditional chemical hydrotropes, potentially holding promises in therapeutic interventions in protein-aggregation-related diseases. Going beyond its conventional activity as energy currency, the amphiphilic nature of ATP enables its protein-specific interaction that would enhance ATP’s efficiency in cellular processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88414">Spatial transcriptomics of meningeal inflammation reveals inflammatory gene signatures in adjacent brain parenchyma</a></h4>

              
                While modern high efficacy disease modifying therapies have revolutionized the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, they are less effective at controlling progressive forms of the disease. Meningeal inflammation is a recognized risk factor for cortical gray matter pathology which can result in disabling symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression, but the mechanisms linking meningeal inflammation and gray matter pathology remain unclear. Here, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spatial transcriptomics in a mouse model of autoimmune meningeal inflammation to characterize the transcriptional signature in areas of meningeal inflammation and the underlying brain parenchyma. We found broadly increased activity of inflammatory signaling pathways at sites of meningeal inflammation, but only a subset of these pathways active in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Subclustering of regions adjacent to meningeal inflammation revealed the subset of immune programs induced in brain parenchyma, notably complement signaling and antigen processing/presentation. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis confirmed variable penetration of immune signatures originating from meningeal inflammation into the adjacent brain tissue. This work contributes a valuable data resource to the field, provides the first detailed spatial transcriptomic characterization in a model of meningeal inflammation, and highlights several candidate pathways in the pathogenesis of gray matter pathology.

                Explaining biodiversity is a fundamental issue in ecology. A long-standing puzzle lies in the paradox of the plankton: many species of plankton feeding on a limited variety of resources coexist, apparently flouting the competitive exclusion principle (CEP), which holds that the number of predator (consumer) species cannot exceed that of the resources at a steady state. Here, we present a mechanistic model and demonstrate that intraspecific interference among the consumers enables a plethora of consumer species to coexist at constant population densities with only one or a handful of resource species. This facilitated biodiversity is resistant to stochasticity, either with the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model naturally explains the classical experiments that invalidate the CEP, quantitatively illustrates the universal S-shaped pattern of the rank-abundance curves across a wide range of ecological communities, and can be broadly used to resolve the mystery of biodiversity in many natural ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88958">Predicting the sequence-dependent backbone dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins</a></h4>

              
                How the sequences of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) code for functions is still an enigma. Dynamics, in particular residue-specific dynamics, holds crucial clues. Enormous efforts have been spent to characterize residue-specific dynamics of IDPs, mainly through NMR spin relaxation experiments. Here, we present a sequence-based method, SeqDYN, for predicting residue-specific backbone dynamics of IDPs. SeqDYN employs a mathematical model with 21 parameters: one is a correlation length and 20 are the contributions of the amino acids to slow dynamics. Training on a set of 45 IDPs reveals aromatic, Arg, and long-branched aliphatic amino acids as the most active in slow dynamics whereas Gly and short polar amino acids as the least active. SeqDYN predictions not only provide an accurate and insightful characterization of sequence-dependent IDP dynamics but may also serve as indicators in a host of biophysical processes, including the propensities of IDP sequences to undergo phase separation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89509">The zinc transporter Slc30a1 (ZnT1) in macrophages plays a protective role against attenuated Salmonella</a></h4>

              
                The zinc transporter Slc30a1 plays an essential role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis. Despite this, its functional role in macrophages remains largely unknown. Here, we examine the function of Slc30a1 in host defense using mice models infected with an attenuated stain of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium and primary macrophages infected with the attenuated <i>Salmonella</i>. Bulk transcriptome sequencing in primary macrophages identifies Slc30a1 as a candidate in response to <i>Salmonella</i> infection. Whole-mount immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy imaging of primary macrophage and spleen from <i>Salmonella</i>-infected <i>Slc30a1<sup>flag-EGFP</sup></i> mice demonstrate Slc30a1 expression is increased in infected macrophages with localization at the plasma membrane and in the cytosol. <i>Lyz2</i>-Cre-driven <i>Slc30a1</i> conditional knockout mice (<i>Slc30a1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Lyz2-Cre</i>) exhibit increased susceptibility to <i>Salmonella</i> infection compared to control littermates. We demonstrate that Slc30a1-deficient macrophages are defective in intracellular killing, which correlated with reduced activation of nuclear factor kappa B and reduction in nitric oxide (NO) production. Notably, the model exhibits intracellular zinc accumulation, demonstrating that Slc30a1 is required for zinc export. We thus conclude that zinc export enables the efficient NO-mediated antibacterial activity of macrophages to control invading <i>Salmonella</i>.

                Pre- and perinatal factors such as maternal pregnancy and child birth complications affect child brain development, emphasizing the importance of early life exposures. While most previous studies have focused on a few variables in isolation, here, we investigated associations between a broad range of pregnancy- and birth-related variables and multivariate cortical brain MRI features. Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 years from the ABCD Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pre- and perinatal variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, compromised fetal growth, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and compromised fetal growth, including low birth weight, being born preterm, or as a twin, were associated with smaller global surface area. Additionally, compromised fetal growth was associated with two regional patterns reflecting a complex combination of 1) smaller occipital, inferior frontal and insular cortex, larger fronto-temporal cortex, thinner pre- and post-central cortex, and thicker inferior frontal and insular cortex, and 2) smaller and thicker occipital and temporal lobe cortex, and larger and thinner insular cortex. In contrast, maternal substance use and newborn birth complications showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal growth to global surface area and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.

                Spinocerebellar ataxia 13 (SCA13) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by mutations in KCNC3. Our previous studies revealed that KCNC3 mutation R423H results in an early-onset form of SCA13. Previous biological models of SCA13 include zebrafish and Drosophila but no mammalian systems. More recently, mouse models with KCNC3 mutations presented behavioral abnormalities but without obvious pathological changes in the cerebellum, a hallmark of patients with SCA13. Here, we present a novel transgenic mouse model by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering to express the full-length mouse Kcnc3 expressing the R424H mutation. This BAC-R424H mice exhibited behavioral and pathological changes mimicking the clinical phenotype of the disease. The BAC-R424H mice (homologous to R423H in human) developed early onset clinical symptoms with aberrant gait, tremor, and cerebellar hypoplasia/atrophy. Histopathological analysis of the cerebellum in BAC-R424H mice showed progressive Purkinje cell loss and thinning of the molecular cell layer. Additionally, Purkinje cells of BAC-R424H mice showed significantly lower spontaneous firing frequency with a corresponding increase in inter-spike interval compared to that of wild-type mice. Our SCA13 transgenic mice recapitulate both neuropathological and behavioral changes manifested in human SCA13 R423H patients and provide an advantageous approach to understanding the role of voltage-gated potassium channel in cerebellar morphogenesis and function. This mammalian in vivo model will lead to further understanding of the R423H allelic form of SCA13 from the molecular to the behavioral level and serve as a platform for testing potential therapeutic compounds.

">Dual transcranial electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus-hippocampus network boosts human long-term memory</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have the potential to improve memory functions. However, the results so far have been relatively modest and time-consuming. Here, we implemented a novel 3-minute combination of personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (intermittent theta burst-iTBS) coupled with simultaneous application of gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation ({gamma}tACS) over the precuneus, a brain area connected with the hippocampus, to modulate long term memory in healthy subjects. Only dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus produced a consistent increase in long-term associative memory as compared to iTBS alone and sham conditions in a sample of healthy volunteers. The effects were replicated in another independent sample, in which the increased associative memory was retained for up to one week. Moreover, dual stimulation increased gamma oscillations and precuneus-hippocampus functional connectivity through the white matter tracts linking the precuneus with the temporal lobe. These findings show that dual stimulation may lead neuronal assemblies in a state favorable to enhance long-term plasticity and identify the precuneus as a key brain area involved in memory formation. Personalized dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus-hippocampus network may represent a new powerful approach for enhancing memory functions in several healthy and clinical conditions.

">Sensitivity of Cerebellar Reaching Ataxia to Kinematic and Dynamic Demands</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with cerebellar ataxia often face significant challenges in controlling reaching, especially when multijoint movements are involved. This study investigated the effects of kinematic and dynamic demands on reaching movements by individuals with cerebellar ataxia and healthy controls using a virtual reality task. Participants reached to target locations designed to elicit a range of coordination strategies between shoulder and elbow joint movements. Results showed that the cerebellar group exhibited greater trajectory curvature and variability in hand paths compared to controls, with pronounced deficits in the initial hand movement direction. Kinematic simulations indicated that early hand movement errors were sensitive to the required onset times and rates of joint movements and were most impaired when opposite direction joint movements were required (e.g., elbow extension with shoulder flexion). This highlights significant disruptions in motion planning and feedforward control in the cerebellar group. Dynamic analysis showed that cerebellar participants' movements were more impaired in reaching directions where interaction torques normally assist the desired elbow and shoulder movements, which required them to rely more on muscle torques to move. These reach directions were also those that required opposite direction joint movements. Overall, our data suggest that reaching deficits in cerebellar ataxia result from 1) the early-phase motion planning deficits that worsen with tight timing requirements and 2) the inability to compensate for interaction torques, particularly when they assist the intended movement.

">Dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation over the primary motor cortices increases interhemispheric inhibition and improves bimanual dexterity: A triple-blind, randomised, sham-controlled study</a></h4>

              
                Concurrent application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over distant cortical regions has been shown to modulate functional connectivity between stimulated regions; however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated how dual-site tACS (ds-tACS) applied over the bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) modulates connectivity between M1s. Using a cross-over sham-controlled triple-blind within-subject design, 37 (27 female, age 18-37yrs) healthy participants received tACS (1.0mA, 20Hz) over the bilateral M1s for 20 min. Before and after tACS, functional connectivity between M1s was assessed using imaginary coherence (ImCoh) measured via resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) via dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol. Additionally, manual dexterity was assessed using the Purdue pegboard task. While ImCoh remained unchanged after simulation, spectral power analysis showed a significant decrease in beta (20 Hz) power during the tACS session. ds-tACS but not sham strengthened IHI between the M1s and improved bimanual assembly performance. These results suggest that improvement in bimanual performance may be explained by modulation in M1-M1 IHI, rather than by coupling in the oscillatory activity. As functional connectivity underlies many clinical symptoms in neurological and psychiatric disorders, these findings are invaluable in developing non-invasive therapeutic interventions that target neural networks to alleviate symptoms.

	<p>Background/Objectives: There have been attempts to detect depression using medical-grade electroencephalograph (EEG) data based on a machine learning approach. EEG has garnered interest as a method for assessing brainwaves by attaching electrodes to the scalp to obtain electrical activity in the brain. Recently, machine learning has been applied to the EEG data to detect depression, with encouraging results. Specifically, studies using medical-grade EEG data have shown that depression can be accurately detected. However, there is a need to expand the range of applications by achieving a score with machine learning using simpler consumer-grade brain wave sensors. At present, a sufficient score has not been achieved.; Methods: To improve the score of depression detection, we quantified various EEG indices to train models such as power spectrum, asymmetry, complexity, and functional connectivity. In addition, feature selection was performed to ensure that the model learns only promising EEG indices for depression detection. The feature selection methods were Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) feature importance, mutual information, ReliefF and ElasticNet coefficients. The selected EEG indices were learned by the LightGBM model, which is reported to be as accurate as the latest deep learning models. In cross-validation, the independence of test and training data was ensured to avoid excessively calculated score; Results: The results showed that the Macro F1 score was 91.59%, suggesting that a consumer-grade EEG can detect depression. In addition, analysis of the EEG indices selected by feature selection indicated that the Macro F1 score was about 80% for single EEG indices such as differential entropy in the frequency band &amp;amp;beta; and functional connectivity in the left frontal region in the frequency band 1&amp;amp;ndash;128 Hz; Conclusions: Although the data were obtained from a consumer-grade EEG, the results suggest that these EEG indices are promising for detection depression.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Decreased plasma BDNF (pBDNF) levels have been proposed as a biomarker in the illness phases of mood disorders. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the pBDNF and BDNF promoters&amp;amp;rsquo; DNA methylation levels in workers exposed to occupational stress and suffering from work-related stress disorders. Methods: the pBDNF and BDNF exon I and IV promoters&amp;amp;rsquo; methylation levels were measured by specific immunoassays and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) in 62 patients with adjustment disorders (AD), 79 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 44 healthy controls. Occupational stress was evaluated in the patients and controls using the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Results: the pBDNF levels were significantly higher in the MDD (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and AD (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) patients than in the controls. The MDD patients showed significantly lower pBDNF levels than the AD ones (p = 0.01). The BDNF exon I and IV promoters&amp;amp;rsquo; methylation levels were significantly higher in the MDD patients than in the AD ones (exon I promoter: p = 0.0001, exon IV promoter: p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and controls (exon I promoter: p = 0.0001, exon IV promoter: p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). In the patients, but not in the controls, the BDNF promoters&amp;amp;rsquo; methylation levels showed significant negative correlations with occupational stress. Conclusions: BDNF could play a key role in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders and the peripheral elevation of it observed in patients exposed to occupational stress could suggest a protective mechanism for neurons from stress-mediated damage. The elevation of the pBDNF levels, even in MDD, may characterize a &amp;amp;ldquo;reactive&amp;amp;rdquo; subtype of depressive episode, while the significant elevation of the BDNF promoters&amp;amp;rsquo; methylation levels in depressed patients could indicate a predisposition to more severe illness under stress. Further research is needed, focusing on biomarkers for stress-related disorders as a potential tool for the diagnosis and prevention of occupational diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Chronic pain syndromes pose a significant global health challenge to patients and physicians with a complex relationship of biological and psychosocial factors that are only partly understood. Emerging research suggests an association between prenatal and childhood adversity and the development of somatic syndromes, particularly in females. This study aims to explore the relationship between sexual dimorphic epigenetic changes in the connectome and prenatal and early life adversity (ELA). Methods: A review of the existing literature was conducted, examining studies utilizing MRI to identify critical periods of environmental influence on neural phenotypes. Results: The findings indicate a significant association between prenatal and childhood adversity and the emergence of central sensitization syndromes, particularly among females. Notably, alterations in grey matter volume and neural connectivity patterns were observed, suggesting that early adverse experiences can influence pain signaling mechanisms. Conclusions: Understanding the role of sex differences in brain circuitry is crucial for developing personalized pain management strategies. This study highlights the importance of considering both biological and psychosocial factors in addressing chronic pain, as interventions based predominantly on male subjects may be less effective for females. Further research is warranted to explore these differences and refine therapeutic approaches.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Electronic sports (esports) have grown into a major competitive field in today&amp;amp;rsquo;s digital landscape, attracting the interest of established companies and evolving into a fast-growing industry. Cognitive function, including reaction time, motor time, and eye&amp;amp;ndash;hand coordination, plays a crucial role in e-athlete performance. This study aims to examine the impact of VR training on these cognitive functions in amateur e-athletes. Methods: The study involved 66 amateur e-athletes (45 men and 21 women, aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;41, with a mean age of 23.96 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.90 years) who reported active, non-professional involvement in esports. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (E) (n = 32) and a control group (C) (n = 34), with initial comparisons confirming no significant differences in daily gaming habits, esports experience, or age between groups. The E group completed 15-minute daily training sessions using the VR game Beat Saber over eight consecutive days. Results: The results demonstrated that VR training significantly improved eye&amp;amp;ndash;hand coordination in the experimental group, although there were no notable effects on reaction time or motor time. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VR training may be an effective method to enhance certain cognitive functions, specifically eye&amp;amp;ndash;hand coordination, among amateur e-athletes. This could offer a valuable approach for performance improvement in this rapidly growing field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives. Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) are pathologies that affect millions of people worldwide. They have no effective therapy and are difficult to prevent and control when they develop. It has been known for many years that these diseases have many pathogenic aspects in common. We highlight in this review that neuroglial cells (astroglia, oligodendroglia, and microglia) play a vital role in the origin, clinical&amp;amp;ndash;pathological development, and course of brain neurodegeneration. Moreover, we include the new results of a T2D-AD mouse model (APP+PS1 mice on a high-calorie diet) that we are investigating. Methods. Critical bibliographic revision and biochemical neuropathological study of neuroglia in a T2D-AD model. Results. T2D and AD are not only &amp;amp;ldquo;connected&amp;amp;rdquo; by producing complex pathologies in the same individual (obesity, T2D, and AD), but they also have many common pathogenic mechanisms. These include insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation (both peripheral and central&amp;amp;mdash;or neuroinflammation). Cognitive impairment and AD are the maximum exponents of brain neurodegeneration in these pathological processes. both due to the dysfunctions induced by metabolic changes in peripheral tissues and inadequate neurotoxic responses to changes in the brain. In this review, we first analyze the common pathogenic mechanisms of obesity, T2D, and AD (and/or cerebral vascular dementia) that induce transcendental changes and responses in neuroglia. The relationships between T2D and AD discussed mainly focus on neuroglial responses. Next, we present neuroglial changes within their neuropathological context in diverse scenarios: (a) aging involution and neurodegenerative disorders, (b) human obesity and diabetes and obesity/diabetes models, (c) human AD and in AD models, and (d) human AD-T2D and AD-T2D models. An important part of the data presented comes from our own studies on humans and experimental models over the past few years. In the T2D-AD section, we included the results of a T2D-AD mouse model (APP+PS1 mice on a high-calorie diet) that we investigated, which showed that neuroglial dysfunctions (astrocytosis and microgliosis) manifest before the appearance of amyloid neuropathology, and that the amyloid pathology is greater than that presented by mice fed a normal, non-high-caloric diet A broad review is finally included on pharmacological, cellular, genic, and non-pharmacological (especially diet and lifestyle) neuroglial-related treatments, as well as clinical trials in a comparative way between T2D and AD. These neuroglial treatments need to be included in the multimodal/integral treatments of T2D and AD to achieve greater therapeutic efficacy in many millions of patients. Conclusions. Neuroglial alterations (especially in astroglia and microglia, cornerstones of neuroinflammation) are markedly defining brain neurodegeneration in T2D and A, although there are some not significant differences between each of the studied pathologies. Neuroglial therapies are a very important and p. promising tool that are being developed to prevent and/or treat brain dysfunction in T2D-AD. The need for further research in two very different directions is evident: (a) characterization of the phenotypic changes of astrocytes and microglial cells in each region of the brain and in each phase of development of each isolated and associated pathology (single-cell studies are mandatory) to better understand the pathologies and define new therapeutic targets; (b) studying new therapeutic avenues to normalize the function of neuroglial cells (preventing neurotoxic responses and/or reversing them) in these pathologies, as well as the phenotypic characteristics in each moment of the course and place of the neurodegenerative process.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Palatability significantly influences food consumption, often leading to overeating and obesity by activating the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s reward systems. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a central role in this process, modulating reward mechanisms primarily via dopamine through D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, D4R). While the involvement of D2 receptors in feeding is well-documented, the role of D4 receptors (D4Rs) is less clear. Methods: Male Wistar rats received intra-NAc shell microinjections of the D4R agonist PD-168077 and the antagonist L-745870. This study also examined the modulation between D4R and glutamatergic transmission by administration of NMDA, NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5, AMPA, and AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX. Results: PD-168077 increased sweet solution intake by 46%, an effect that was reversed by L-745870. Pre-treatment with NMDA prevented the stimulatory effect of PD-168077, whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 had no such effect. Additionally, AMPA administration reduced sweet solution intake by 63%, counteracting the effect of PD-168077, while the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX, on its own, increased intake by 40%. Conclusions: These findings suggest that D4Rs promote hedonic feeding by modulating glutamatergic transmission in the NAc shell, highlighting the complexity of D4R involvement in food intake regulation. This study underscores the potential of targeting D4Rs for therapeutic interventions in eating disorders and obesity, though further research is essential to clarify the precise mechanisms through which D4R modulates AMPA and NMDA receptor activity in feeding behavior.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is a subset of patients with pain who become worse after exercise. To explore this, we examined the responses of people with chronic primary pain to a standardized high intensity exercise protocol used to induce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Methods: Ten participants with a diagnosis of chronic widespread muscle pain (CWMP) were matched by age and reported gender to ten participants without muscle pain (i.e., no pain (NP)). Participants completed a standardized DOMS protocol. Pain intensity in the arm at rest and with movement was assessed using daily electronic diaries. Peak pain, the timing of peak pain, and the time to recovery were compared between groups. Associations of pain variables with the functional connectivity of the sensorimotor (SMN), cerebellum, frontoparietal control (FPN), and default mode network (DMN) both within network nodes and the rest of the brain was assessed. Results: Significant differences in peak pain, the time to peak pain, and the time to recovery were noted between groups for both pain at rest and pain with movement after controlling for catastrophizing and pain resilience. Connectivity across the SMN, FPN, and DMN was associated with all pain-related variables. Significant group differences were identified between groups. Conclusions: A standardized muscle &amp;amp;ldquo;injury&amp;amp;rdquo; protocol resulted in more pain, a longer time to peak pain, and a longer time to resolve pain in the patient group compared to the NP group. These differences were associated with differences in connectivity across brain regions related to sensorimotor integration and appraisal. These findings provide preliminary evidence of the dysregulation of responses to muscle (micro)trauma in people with chronic pain.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) accounts for 70% of dementia cases and with no effective pharmacological treatments, new rehabilitation methods are needed. Motor and cognitive activities and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in stabilizing and enhancing cognitive functions. Objective: we want to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with motor or cognitive activity on cognitive functions in AD patients. (2) Methods: Patients with mild or moderate AD were randomized between anodic tDCS groups (MotA or CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS or CogS). They received two weeks of treatment (45 min, five days/week), with the first 15 min using tDCS stimulation on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cognitive assessments were conducted pre-treatment (T0), post-treatment (T1), and one week after (T2). (3) Results: Twenty-three patients were included. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between anodic tDCS groups (MotA + CogA) and sham tDCS groups (MotS + CogS) with advantages for the first in improving global cognitive status (p = 0.042), selective attention (p = 0.012), and sustained attention (p = 0.012). Further analysis indicated no differences between the two anodic tDCS groups between T0 and T1. (4) Conclusions: combined anodal tDCS with motor or cognitive activity could improve global cognitive state and attention, slowing cognitive decline in AD patients. The trial was registered on Clinical Trials: NCT06619795.</p>

	<p>Chronic low back pain (CLBP) negatively impacts quality of life and contributes to a significant economic burden. One conservative management strategy for CLBP is lumbar back bracing. Despite the benefits of back bracing for improving pain and function, there remains hesitance to use the therapy long term due to unfounded fear related to muscle weakness, deconditioning, or joint contracture. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes for patients with CLBP who were managed with lumbar back bracing and physical therapy. Methods: This was a single-site, retrospective chart review. Results: Patients were included in the study if they were treated for CLBP with back bracing for at least one hour daily and physical therapy for twelve weeks. Pain was assessed at three, six, and twelve months using the 11-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Function was assessed at three months using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The VAS score reduced from 6.28 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.32 to 3.96 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.66 at three months (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) for 198 patients. At six and twelve months, the VAS score reduced to 3.74 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.73 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 3.23 +/&amp;amp;minus; 2.29 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), respectively. The total ODI score for 199 patients improved from 46.56 +/&amp;amp;minus; 15.30 to 33.13 +/&amp;amp;minus; 19.99 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) at three months. Conclusion: Back bracing in combination with physical therapy is effective for treating low back pain.</p>

	<p>Background: Growing evidence suggests that glucose metabolism plays a crucial role in activated immune cells, significantly contributing to the occurrence and development of neuroinflammation and depression-like behaviors. Chronic stress has been reported to induce microglia activation and disturbances in glucose metabolism in the hippocampus. Aims: This study aims to investigate how chronic stress-mediated glycolysis promotes neuroinflammation and to assess the therapeutic potential of the glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), in a model of chronic stress-induced neuroinflammation and depression-like behavior. Methods: In in vitro studies, we first explored the effects of 2-DG on the inflammatory response of microglia cells. The results showed that corticosterone (Cort) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased glycolysis, and promoted the release of inflammatory mediators. However, these effects were reversed by intervention with 2-DG. Subsequently, we examined changes in depression-like behavior and hippocampal glycolysis in mice during chronic stress. The results indicated that chronic stress led to prolonged escape latency in the Morris water maze, increased platform-crossing frequency, reduced sucrose preference index, and extended immobility time in the forced swim test, all of which are indicative of depression-like behavior in mice. Additionally, we found that the expression of the key glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) was upregulated in the hippocampus of stressed mice, along with an increased release of inflammatory factors. Further in vivo experiments investigated the effects of 2-DG on glycolysis and pro-inflammatory mediator production, as well as the therapeutic effects of 2-DG on chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice. The results showed that 2-DG alleviated chronic stress-induced depression-like behaviors, such as improving escape latency and platform-crossing frequency in the Morris water maze, and increasing the time spent in the center of the open field. Additionally, 2-DG intervention reduced the level of glycolysis in the hippocampus and decreased the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Conclusions: These findings suggest that 2-DG can mitigate neuroinflammation and depressive behaviors by inhibiting glycolysis and inflammatory responses. Overall, our results highlight the potential of 2-DG as a therapeutic agent for alleviating chronic stress-induced neuroinflammation through the regulation of glycolysis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: MMAE (middle meningeal artery embolization) has emerged as a potential effective treatment for cSDH (chronic subdural hematoma). In this study, MMAE efficiency with regards to cSDH cause and architecture was explored. The comparability of cSDH thickness and volume as parameters for cSDH pre- and post-MMAE assessment was also analyzed. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 52 consecutive cSDH patients treated with MMAE in a single tertiary center were included. The cohort was divided into two group pairs pertaining to cSDH cause (spontaneous or traumatic) and cSDH architecture (non-mature or mature). The radiological outcome was compared in each group before and after MMAE and between each group pair using CT imaging. A correlation analysis between cSDH thickness and volume before and after MMAE was also performed. Results: A statistically significant positive linear association between cSDH thickness and volume at admission and at each follow-up interval (1&amp;amp;ndash;3, 3&amp;amp;ndash;6, 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months) was noticed. cSDH thickness and volume reduction in each group was statistically significant, except for a traumatic cSDH volume reduction at 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months. There was no statistically significant difference between each group pair in the cSDH thickness and volume reduction difference at all the follow-up intervals. Conclusions: A comparable efficiency of MMAE may be achieved in non-mature and mature as well as in spontaneous and traumatic cSDH, with an advantage for spontaneous cSDH at 6&amp;amp;ndash;12 months follow-up compared to traumatic cSDH. Traumatic cSDH may require a relatively long-term follow-up post-MMAE. cSDH thickness and volume, as parameters for pre- and post-MMAE cSDH evaluation, appear similar.</p>

	<p>Objectives: During cochlear implant (CI) electrode placement, single low-frequency (e.g., 500 Hz) cochlear microphonics (CM) measurements are used to monitor hair-cell function and provide feedback to avert insertion trauma. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between trauma and the electrode&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression through the cochlea when monitored with a single frequency. Multi-frequency CM measurements, while more complex to analyze, can provide more accurate feedback by measuring CM from various locations along the basilar membrane. Methods: A new algorithm was developed to analyze multi-frequency CM tracings by comparing amplitude and phase changes across different test frequencies. The new algorithm was evaluated as to its ability to identify drop-alarm instances with the multi-frequency approach, as compared to single-frequency 500 Hz tracings. Results: The algorithm presented in this manuscript uses the relationship between CM amplitude and phase changes across frequencies to provide real-time feedback during CI electrode placement. The results show that multi-frequency CM tracings raised an alarm only 0.5 times, as compared to 2.8 instances of alarm raised for the single-frequency 500 Hz CM measurements. Conclusions: Multi-frequency CM tracings can help reduce the number of alarms which may be false positives prompting unnecessary electrode manipulations, thereby minimizing the risk of insertion trauma.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are designed to precisely and selectively target specific brain regions, thus enabling focused modulation of neural activity. Among NIBS technologies, low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising new modality. The application of tFUS can safely and non-invasively stimulate deep brain structures with millimetric precision, offering distinct advantages in terms of accessibility to non-cortical regions over other NIBS methods. However, to date, several tFUS aspects still need to be characterized; furthermore, there are only a handful of studies that have utilized tFUS in psychiatric populations. This narrative review provides an up-to-date overview of key aspects of this NIBS technique, including the main components of a tFUS system, the neuronavigational tools used to precisely target deep brain regions, the simulations utilized to optimize the stimulation parameters and delivery of tFUS, and the experimental protocols employed to evaluate the efficacy of tFUS in psychiatric disorders. The main findings from studies in psychiatric populations are presented and discussed, and future directions are highlighted.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have shown that creative thinking is associated with metacontrol, but its neural basis is unknown. The present study explored the neural basis of both by assessing EEG complexity through multiscale entropy. Subjects were engaged in a metacontrol task and an Alternative Uses Task, grouped according to task performance, and the EEG was analysed by multiscale entropy. The results showed that EEG complexity was significantly higher in the high-metacontrol and high-creativity groups than in the low-metacontrol and low-creativity groups, respectively, at high time scales. The metacontrol adaptability score and multipurpose task score were significantly and positively correlated with the EEG complexity at multiple electrode sites. It suggests that metacontrol and creativity are dependent on the activation of long-duration neural networks.</p>

	<p>Background: The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between low muscle mass (LMM) and depression, with a specific focus on identifying the sex-specific relationship between LMM and depression in a large sample. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study involved 292,922 community-dwelling adults from 2012 to 2019. Measurements were taken using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) scale and body composition analyses. Depression was defined as a CESD score &amp;amp;ge; 16, and severe depression as a CESD score &amp;amp;ge; 22. LMM was defined as an appendicular muscle mass/height2 below 7.0 kg/m2 in men and below 5.4 kg/m2 in women. Sex-based multivariable logistic regression analyzed the LMM&amp;amp;ndash;depression association, adjusting for confounders, with depression status and severe depression status as dependent variables. Results: Both men and women in the LMM group had an increased odds of depression (men, adjusted odds ratio = 1.13 [95% confidence interval = 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;1.12]; women, 1.07 [1.03&amp;amp;ndash;1.23]) and severe depression (men, 1.20 [1.05&amp;amp;ndash;1.36]; women, 1.10 [1.04&amp;amp;ndash;1.15]) compared to those in the control group. Men showed a stronger association between LMM and the presence of depression (p for interaction = 0.025) and the presence of severe depression (p for interaction = 0.025) compared to women. Conclusions: Decreased muscle mass was independently associated with increased chances of depression and severe depression in both sexes, with a significantly stronger association in men compared to women. This highlights the potential significance of LMM as a predictor of depression, particularly in men.</p>

	<p>In the past five years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has evolved significantly, driven by advancements in device design, treatment protocols, software integration, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This review evaluates how these innovations enhance the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of rTMS while identifying key challenges such as protocol standardization and ethical considerations. A structured review of peer-reviewed studies from 2019 to 2024 focused on technological and clinical advancements in rTMS, including AI-driven personalized treatments, portable devices, and integrated BCIs. AI algorithms have optimized patient-specific protocols, while portable devices have expanded access. Enhanced coil designs and BCI integration offer more precise and adaptive neuromodulation. However, challenges remain in standardizing protocols, addressing device complexity, and ensuring equitable access. While recent innovations improve rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s clinical utility, gaps in long-term efficacy and ethical concerns persist. Future research must prioritize standardization, accessibility, and robust ethical frameworks to ensure rTMS&amp;amp;rsquo;s sustainable impact.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural processes involved in visual detection, decision-making, and motor plan execution are believed to play a key role in the avoidance of sport-related injuries, but very little evidence exists to guide the development of training activities for the optimization of brain function. Immersive virtual reality provides a means to precisely measure the amount of time that elapses from visual stimulus presentation to the initiation of a motor response (i.e., perceptual latency) or its completion (i.e., response time). Methods: The median value of a metric quantifying both the speed and accuracy (i.e., the rate correct per second of response time) of 50 high school female soccer players was used to assign those who exhibited suboptimal performance to a training program. Training sessions required less than 5 min and the number of sessions completed over a 7-week period ranged from 3 to 13 (median = 5). Results: Among 42 players available for follow-up assessment at 8 weeks after the first practice session (training n = 19; comparison n = 23), the results of regression-discontinuity analyses demonstrated statistically significant differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) for metrics representing fast/accurate movement initiation (i.e., the rate correct score for perceptual latency, p = 0.016) and across-trial consistency (i.e., perceptual latency variability, p = 0.027). From the first practice session to the end of the soccer season, 12 injuries were sustained by 10 players (four concussions and eight musculoskeletal injuries). A time-to-event analysis demonstrated strong associations with perceptual latency variability &amp;amp;ge; 0.143 (Hazard Ratio = 15.43, p = 0.011) and a lifetime history of at least one concussion (Hazard Ratio = 8.84, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The strong association of movement initiation consistency with the avoidance of concussion or musculoskeletal injury suggests that the training program may have a highly beneficial far-transfer effect.</p>

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Smoking may also increase the risk of developing ACS. The most advantageous therapy is percutaneous coronary intervention. However, this therapy may fail because of the no-reflow phenomenon. This case report describes a young male patient admitted to the emergency department due to ST-segment elevation of myocardial infarction (STEMI), with smoking as the only risk factor. Case description A 37-year-old male presented to our hospital with a typical chest pain. He was a heavy smoker. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed extensive anterior STEMI. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a high-burden thrombus. The no-reflow phenomenon occurs during Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI). After two days of hospitalization, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient was administered ticagrelor, acetylsalicylic acid, enoxaparin for three days, high-dose statins, and optimized heart failure treatment. The patient was discharged on the 7th day after admission. Discussion Cigarette smoke chemicals may induce atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries. Lipid oxidation leads to plaque formation. If plaque ruptures, it will cause thrombus occlusion. A high-burden thrombus can induce a no-reflow phenomenon, leading to heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Conclusion Smoking may induce STEMI and tends to result in a high-burden thrombus. The no-reflow phenomenon is an evidence of miscarriage during PCI, which may increase because of smoking.

                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Background Teaching professionalization aimed at the digital transformation of educational scenarios and training processes for students in contemporary higher education requires the mastery of digital competence by the teaching staff. The objectives of the study were to analyze the self-perceived level of digital teaching competence (DTC) of the faculty of the Technical University of Manabí (UTM), Ecuador, and to establish the relationship between age, sex, and academic profile variables with digital teaching competence. Methods A quantitative methodological approach was adopted to develop a descriptive-correlational field study with a non-experimental design. The participants were 277 professors, selected through non-probabilistic and voluntary sampling, who completed the DigCompEdu Check-In questionnaire sent by e-mail. Results The data revealed that the “integrator” and “expert” categories achieved high levels in all competencies. In particular, 48.74% of the participants were placed in the integrator category in the competence of facilitating skills, while 46.21% positioned themselves as integrators in the competence of evaluation and feedback. Additionally, a significant difference was found in the pedagogy variable in the interaction. Conclusions It is concluded that the competences self-perceived by the professors are within the intermediate categories such as integrator and expert. Likewise, the age, sex, and academic profile variables differ in the digital pedagogy level, which produces an inconsistent relationship, with the exception of the variable evaluates and provides feedback, where it was significant.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0141-24.2024?rss=1">The Zebrafish Cerebellar Neural Circuits Are Involved in Orienting Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deficits in social behavior are found in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Since abnormalities in cerebellar morphology and function are observed in ASD patients, the cerebellum is thought to play a role in social behavior. However, it remains unknown whether the cerebellum is involved in social behavior in other animals and how cerebellar circuits control social behavior. To address this issue, we employed zebrafish stereotyped orienting behavior as a model of social behaviors, in which a pair of adult zebrafish in two separate tanks approach each other, with one swimming at synchronized angles (orienting angles) with the other. We harnessed transgenic zebrafish that express botulinum toxin, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters, in either granule cells or Purkinje cells (PCs), and zebrafish mutants of <I>reelin</I>, which is involved in the positioning of cerebellar neurons, including PCs. These zebrafish, deficient in the function or formation of cerebellar neural circuits, showed a significantly shorter period of orienting behavior compared with their control siblings. We found an increase in c-<I>fos</I> and <I>egr1</I> expression in the cerebellum after the orienting behavior. These results suggest that zebrafish cerebellar circuits play an important role in social orienting behavior.</p>

                <p>Illusionism is a general philosophical framework in which specific theories of consciousness can be constructed without having to invoke a magical mind essence. The advantages of illusionism are not widely recognized, perhaps because scholars tend to think only of the most extreme forms and miss the range of possibilities. The brain's internal models are never fully accurate, nothing is exactly as the brain represents it, and therefore some element of illusionism is almost certainly necessary for any working theory of consciousness or of any other property that is accessed through introspection. Here I describe the illusionist framework and propose six specific theories. One purpose of this article is to demonstrate the range of possibilities in a domain that is not yet sufficiently explored. The second purpose is to argue that even existing, popular theories, such as the integrated information theory or the global workspace theory, can be transformed and greatly strengthened by adding an illusionist layer. The third purpose is to argue that when illusionist logic is used, even very disparate theories of consciousness that emerge from unrelated conceptual origins begin to converge onto a deeper, unified understanding.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0436-23.2024?rss=1">Coding Dynamics of the Striatal Networks During Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>The rat dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS), equivalent to caudate nucleus and putamen in primates, are required for goal-directed and habit behaviour, respectively. However, it is still unclear whether and how this functional dichotomy emerges in the course of learning. In this study, we investigated this issue by recording DMS and DLS single neuron activity in rats performing a continuous spatial alternation task, from the acquisition to optimized performance. We first applied a classical analytical approach to identify task-related activity based on the modifications of single neuron firing rate in relation to specific task events or maze trajectories. We then used an innovative approach based on Hawkes process to reconstruct a directed connectivity graph of simultaneously recorded neurons, that was used to decode animal behavior. This approach enabled us to better unravel the role of DMS&nbsp;and DLS neural networks across learning stages. We showed that DMS and DLS display different task-related activity throughout learning stages, and the proportion of coding neurons over time decreases in the DMS and increases in the DLS. Despite these major differences, the decoding power of both networks increases during learning. These results suggest that DMS and DLS neural networks gradually reorganize in different ways in order to progressively increase their control over the behavioral performance.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Pollution refers to the addition of harmful substances to that level where they cause an effect on the environment, it has three major categories such as water, soil, and air pollution but this report is on water pollution. It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                <p>by Keith Murphy, Elsa Fouragnan</p>

Our understanding of brain circuit operations and disorders has rapidly outpaced our ability to intervene and restore them. Developing technologies that can precisely interface with any brain region and circuit may combine diagnostics with therapeutic intervention, expediting personalised brain medicine. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising noninvasive solution to this challenge, offering focal precision and scalability. By exploiting the biomechanics of pressure waves on brain tissue, TUS enables multi-site targeted neuromodulation across distributed circuits in the cortex and deeper areas alike. In this Essay, we explore the emergent evidence that TUS can functionally test and modify dysfunctional regions, effectively serving as a search and rescue tool for the brain. We define the challenges and opportunities faced by TUS as it moves towards greater target precision and integration with advanced brain monitoring and interventional technology. Finally, we propose a roadmap for the evolution of TUS as it progresses from a research tool to a clinically validated therapeutic for brain disorders.

                Background Hydatidosis of the thoracic wall differs from other hydatid localizations in its pathophysiology, diagnostic, and therapeutic management. It is a little-studied entity. The objectives of our work were to describe its surgical management and to analyze the factors that may influence recurrence and mortality. Methods A retrospective, descriptive, longitudinal, and multicenter study on four university hospital surgical centers of Tunis, from January 1995 to December 2022 including operated hydatid cysts of the thoracic wall. Overall survival (OS) and cumulative recurrence rates were calculated. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify recurrence and mortality risk factors. Results Forty-nine patients were included. The mean age was 41 ± 17 years [8-76]. The main presenting sign was thoracic parietal swelling (n=22). Chest ultrasound and CT scan showed multivesicular formation in 17 and 33 cases, respectively. Muscle involvement was in the intercostal (n=4), paravertebral (n=13), and pectoralis major (n=3) muscles. Bone involvement was vertebral (n=11), costal (n=12), costo-vertebral (n=21) and sternal (n=2). A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed (n=20). Surgical excision at various levels of the chest wall with spinal stabilization (n=15) was performed. Sixty-three percent of the patients received antiparasitic medical treatment. Recurrence occurred in 37% of cases. Four patients died from hydatidosis-related complications. Factors could be independently associated with recurrence such as male gender, and vertebral involvement. The presence of a visceral hydatid cyst located at a distance from the parietal lesion at the time of diagnosis and the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications could increase mortality. Conclusions Chest wall hydatidosis represents a rare medical condition where surgery remains the preferred treatment modality. However, it carries a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality, influenced by various factors. Further large-scale studies are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of these factors and to optimize management strategies accordingly.

                Background Physical activity trackers possess the potential to encourage increased physical activity. However, users often exhibit poor long-term adherence to these devices, which may stem from a lack of understanding of the factors influencing their use, as well as changes in health behavior. This study aims to provide new insights into the types of health-related apps and devices that young people discover, select, and utilize, along with the underlying reasons for their choices. Methods Young adults aged between 18-25 years reporting the use and nonuse of health apps and wearables were recruited and participated in focus group discussions about app choice, features, their perceptions towards the physical activity trackers, and reasons for continued use and for not using one. A total of Nine FGDS were conducted among users, nonusers, and former users of physical activity tracker usage. Data was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes in an iterative approach. Results The physical activity tracker users group stated that they had a sense of achievement, validation, and other motivational feedback, which helped with adherence. All three groups (user, non-user, and former user) had similar concerns about cost, reliability, accuracy, and dependency. Former users also reported that the idea of accomplishing the goals would create anxiety and, in turn, harm the body. Former users and nonusers expressed their concerns regarding lack of time and loss of motivation to track their physical activity. Nonusers had issues with the functionality of the device (ease of use, battery, notifications, apps hang) and were also aware of all the health benefits of using wearables. Conclusion Physical activity users group, former users group, and nonusers group shared concerns about accuracy, cost, and battery.

                Background Actions that are repetitive and being practiced automatically are called habits. Oral habits can be classified as normal or deleterious. Oral health education starts from footprints of awareness. Growing children require appropriate guidance for healthy growth and maintenance of their teeth, which makes the parent an active participant in the prevention and treatment of malocclusion and thus is majorly affected by their knowledge and attitude regarding various deleterious oral habits and habit breaking appliances. Aim To assess and compare awareness of deleterious oral habits and knowledge of habit breaking appliance, among parents at Alkharj Saudi Arabia. Methodology Study assessed awareness of deleterious oral habits and knowledge of habit breaking appliances among parents in Alkharj, Saudi Arabia. Results Conclusion Majority of the parents were aware of different deleterious oral habits but not aware of the dimensions of interventions like types of appliances, duration of use, etc. without knowing mentioned facts, in future which leads to development of malocclusion which probably requires orthodontic, surgical or prosthetic intervention correcting the outcomes of oral deleterious habits.

                Background Sustainable supply chains are more competitive than conventional supply chains. Supply chain sustainability performance needs to be carried out to determine sustainability under current conditions and to design appropriate strategies to increase sustainability. This study aims to design a sustainability performance assessment model for the sago agro-industry supply chain and identify critical indicators for sustainability improvement. Methods The Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) evaluates sustainability on three levels: economic, social, and environmental. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is then used to aggregate the overall sustainability performance. The cosine amplitude method (CAM) was used to analyze key indicators. This study assessed the sustainability performance on industrial- and small-medium-scale sago agro-industry. Results The results show that the supply chain sustainability performance on the industrial scale is 44.25, while it is 48.81 for the small-medium scale with the same status, almost sustainable. Key indicators for improving sago agro-industry supply chain sustainability performance include profit distribution among supply chain actors, institutional support for supply chains, waste utilization (reuse & recycle), and the availability of waste management facilities. The implication of this research for managers regards assessing the current status of sustainability performance and key indicators as a reference for formulating sustainability strategies and practices. Implication The sago agro-industry sustainability performance evaluation methodology uses industry-relevant metrics to assess supply chain sustainability, promoting collaboration among stakeholders and assisting in the creation of sustainable strategies. Conclusions The results of the study will enable supply chain actors to understand the key indicators for improving sustainability performance in the sago agro-industry supply chain, especially in Meranti Islands Regency, Riau Province. The proposed model can be applied to other agro-industries by adjusting the indicators used and assessing data availability and suitability for the research object.

                Background Heat polymerized acrylic (HPA) resins are known to have high porosity that contributes to increased surface roughness and microcrack formation in stress areas. This facilitates the attachment and growth of polymicrobial biofilms contributing to increased antimicrobial resistance. Many research had been carried out on avocado seeds, but no research that studies avocado seeds effect on denture-plaque microorganism biofilm on HPA resin has been found. Methods This study used 144 samples (n=144), namely HPA resin discs covered with mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms. The discs were soaked for 8 hours in the 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% avocado seed extract, positive control (alkaline peroxide), and negative control (aquadest). Each disc was shaken with a vortex mixer for 1 minute, and 100 μL was added into 96-well microplates with three times repetition and incubated for 24 hours. A microtiter plate biofilm formation assay was then conducted The inhibition values were determined from the percentage inhibition value formula which required absorption values from a microplate reader (595 nm). The research data were analyzed using a univariant test, and a one-way ANOVA test, accompanied by Welch ANOVA on non-homogenous data. Results In this research, it was found that the MBIC50 of avocado seed extract against the mono-species of C. albicans (5%), C. glabrata (5%), A. odontolyticus (15%), S. gordonii (15%), S. aureus (10%), while against polymicrobial was 20%. There was a significant effect of soaking HPA resin in avocado seed extract on the inhibition of mono-species and polymicrobial biofilms with a value of p<0.001 (p<0.05). Conclusion The MBIC50 of avocado seed extract in polymicrobial biofilm group was higher than that in the mono-species biofilm groups. Although alkaline peroxide showed higher inhibition value than that of the MBIC50 in polymicrobial biofilm group, 20% avocado seed extract was concluded effective as it inhibited >50% polymicrobial biofilm.

                Background As of July 2021, only 57% of Ecuador’s population had received the first vaccine dose against COVID-19. The national immunization campaign faced difficulties in reaching and providing vaccines to underserved population in remote areas. Methods The RISE project, funded by USAID and implemented by Jhpiego, aimed to develop an immunization strategy, that through the collaboration of an international non-profit organization, an academic institution and the public sector, could effectively support the national vaccination campaign of the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health. Results The program identified gaps in vaccination access and uptake, established specific strategies for targeted communities, analyzed official geographical information on vaccination coverage, ran micro-planning exercises at the local level, and adapted to new needs identified to ensure an effective vaccination uptake. From November 2021 up to May 2023, more than 1.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to underserved populations living in geographically dispersed areas, in 18 provinces. Conclusions Employing data-targeted approaches and microplanning to identify underserved populations, strategic planning and collaboration between local governments, private sector, academic institution, and community leaders can substantially improve COVID-19 vaccines coverage and, thus, equity to vaccine access. The lessons learned might be useful to improve overall immunization service delivery.

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure throughout gestation and breastfeeding leads to multiple adverse outcomes in the hepatic system. Under oxidative stress, alterations in the liver are related to the inhibition of induced nitric oxide synthase activity in sinusoidal cells as a consequence of low expression of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-kinase interacting (GIT1). Here, we hypothesized that both glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and GIT1 could be altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of human equivalent development. Methods We exposed rats during the third trimester equivalent [postnatal days (PD) 2-8] to moderate levels of maternal EtOH (20%). GPx1 and GIT1 expression was detected by western blotting, and the antioxidant activity of glutathione peroxidase GPx and the concentration of hepatic carbonyl groups (CG were determined by spectrophotometry. Serum biochemistry parameters such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glucose (gluc), cholesterol (chol), and triglycerides (TG) were also measured. Results We found that ethanol decreased both GIT1 and GPx1 selenoprotein expression, affecting GPx antioxidant activity and increasing protein oxidation. Conclusions These results demonstrate for the first time that the GPx antioxidant system altered by EtOH exposure during the third trimester of development is related to a parallel decrease in GIT1 expression [1].

                Background Antibiotic misuse and overuse have contributed to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, posing a serious public health problem across the globe. Phage cocktails, which combine multiple phages, provide an efficient method to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This study integrated a computational pipeline to design a phage cocktail against the bacterial strains Acinetobacter baumannii AB0057, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae HS11286, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. Methods The whole genome sequences of selected multidrug-resistant bacteria were accessed. Prophage sequences were identified from them which could be expressed to produce viable lytic phages against MDR bacterial strains, thereby reducing the severity of infection. Prophages were annotated for open reading frames (ORFs), putative promoters, virulence factors, transcriptional terminators, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNAs. A dot plot was also generated to investigate similar phages and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results A total of 11 prophages were predicted from the bacterial genomes. About 472 open reading frames were predicted along with 3 transfer RNAs. Additionally, the presence of 754 putative promoters and 281 transcription terminator sequences was also detected. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses provided insight into the diversity, relatedness, and lytic potential of the phages. The final designed phage cocktail consisted of five selected prophages including Acinetobacter baumannii prophages (2759376-2809756) and (3311844-3364667), and Klebsiella pneumoniae prophages (1288317-1338719), (1778306-1808606), and (2280703-2325555). Conclusion The phage cocktail designed in this study might be useful against MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, especially where conventional antibiotics fail. Sequence similarity analysis suggested that the phage cocktail may also be effective against other carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains.

                Patients present a wide range of clinical severities in response severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, but the underlying molecular and cellular reasons why clinical outcomes vary so greatly within the population remains unknown. Here, we report that negative clinical outcomes in severely ill patients were associated with divergent RNA transcriptome profiles in peripheral immune cells compared with mild cases during the first weeks after disease onset. Protein–protein interaction analysis indicated that early-responding cytotoxic natural killer cells were associated with an effective clearance of the virus and a less severe outcome. This innate immune response was associated with the activation of select cytokine–cytokine receptor pathways and robust Th1/Th2 cell differentiation profiles. In contrast, severely ill patients exhibited a dysregulation between innate and adaptive responses affiliated with divergent Th1/Th2 profiles and negative outcomes. This knowledge forms the basis of clinical triage that may be used to preemptively detect high-risk patients before life-threatening outcomes ensue.

                The foveated architecture of the human retina and the eye’s mobility enables prime spatial vision, yet the interplay between photoreceptor cell topography and the constant motion of the eye during fixation remains unexplored. With in vivo foveal cone-resolved imaging and simultaneous microscopic photo stimulation, we examined visual acuity in both eyes of 16 participants while precisely recording the stimulus path on the retina. We find that resolution thresholds were correlated with the individual retina’s sampling capacity, and exceeded what static sampling limits would predict by 18%, on average. The length and direction of fixational drift motion, previously thought to be primarily random, played a key role in achieving this sub-cone diameter resolution. The oculomotor system finely adjusts drift behavior towards retinal areas with higher cone densities within only a few hundred milliseconds to enhance retinal sampling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87780">Linking the evolution of two prefrontal brain regions to social and foraging challenges in primates</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains both a fascinating and a controversial issue. Recent comparative studies provided conflicting results regarding the contribution of social vs ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology. Using brain imaging data from 16 primate species, we measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to a combination of socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance (an index of ecological constraints), and population density (an index of social constraints). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Thus, our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.

">Transcriptional profiling of the cortico-accumbal pathway reveals sex-specific alterations underlying stress susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and depressive disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), affect millions of people every year, imposing significant socio-economic burdens. In this scenario, current treatments for MDD show limited efficacy, highlighting the need to better understand its molecular mechanisms. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been identified as a critical brain region in MDD pathology, displaying altered activity and morphology. This study targets the mPFC-to-nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway, which is implicated in the regulation of emotional behavior. We used a pathway-specific approach to uncover transcriptional profiles in mPFC neurons projecting to the NAc in stressed male and female mice. Using the RiboTag technique and RNA sequencing, we identified sex-specific gene expression changes, revealing potential roles in stress susceptibility. Differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analyses revealed distinct transcriptional responses to chronic stress in males and females. Key findings include the identification of the X-linked lymphocyte-regulated 4B (Xlr4b) gene, within a highly relevant gene module, as a stress susceptibility driver in males. By experimentally overexpressing the Xlr4b gene, we characterized its crucial role in regulating neuronal firing and influencing arborization patterns to promote anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific fashion. These findings suggest that chronic stress induces unique and shared transcriptional alterations in mPFC neurons projecting to the NAc. Some of these alterations change the morphological and functional properties of neuronal pathways ultimately contributing to the differential manifestation of anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in male and female mice.

">Adaptive Gaze and Hand Coordination while Manipulating and Monitoring the Environment in Parallel</a></h4>

              
                Research on eye-hand coordination has focused on action tasks performed in isolation. However, real world action tasks are often performed concurrently with perception tasks that compete for gaze. Here we examine how participants adapt their eye and hand movements when performing an object manipulation task, in which they repeatedly grasped a ball and inserted it into a slot, while simultaneously monitoring a text display to detect probabilistically occurring letter changes. We varied the visuomotor demands of the action task by having participants use either their fingertips or tweezers. We found that fixations allocated to the action task were exclusively directed to the ball and slot, and were more prevalent when using tweezers. The timing of ball and slot fixations were coupled in time with ball grasp and slot entry. On average, gaze shifted away from the landmarks ~400 ms before contact when using fingertips,allowing the use of peripheral vision to direct the hand, and around the contact time when using tweezers, further allowing central vision to guide the hand as it approached the ball or slot. We found that participants controlled the timing of their hand movements, as well as the timing and patterns (sequence of fixations) of their eye movements, to exploit the temporal regularities of the perception task, thereby lowering the probability that a letter change would occur during action task fixations. Our results illustrate that eye-hand coordination can be flexibly and intelligently adapted when simultaneously acting on and perceiving the environment.

">A Surface-based deep learning approach for cortical shape analysis</a></h4>

              
                Advances in deep learning hold promise for predicting clinical factors from human brain images. In this study, we applied a spherical harmonics-based convolutional neural network approach (SPHARM-Net) to MRI-derived brain shape metrics to predict age, sex, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. MRI-derived brain features included vertex-wise cortical curvature, convexity, thickness, and surface area. SPHARM-Net performs convolutions using the spherical harmonic transforms, eliminating the need to explicitly define neighborhood size, and achieving rotational equivariance. Sex classification and age regression were carried out in a large sample of healthy adults (UK Biobank; N=32,979), and AD classification performance was tested in a large, publicly available sample (ADNI; N=1,213). SPHARM-Net showed strong performance for sex classification (accuracy=0.91; balanced accuracy= 0.91; AUC=0.97), and age regression (average absolute error=2.97 years; R-squared=0.77; Pearson's coefficient=0.9). AD classification also performed well (accuracy=0.86; balanced accuracy=0.83; AUC=0.9). Our experiments demonstrate promising preliminary performance using the SPHARM-Net for two widely studied benchmarking tasks and for AD classification. Future work will include comparisons of shape-based methods and extending these analysis to more challenging tasks such as mood disorder classification.

">SCAD Delivery Platform: A Novel Approach for Efficient CNS and Extrahepatic Oligonucleotide Therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                Oligonucleotide therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and duplex RNAs like siRNA, saRNA, and miRNA, hold immense potential for treating genetic and acquired diseases by modulating gene expression in a target-specific manner. However, effective delivery to extrahepatic tissues, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), remains a significant challenge. While GalNAc conjugation has enabled liver-specific delivery, leading to several approved siRNA drugs for hepatic targets, CNS delivery lags. ASOs, on the other hand, can self-deliver to the CNS when administered locally, as seen with nusinersen and tofersen. To address this disparity, we've developed the Smart Chemistry Aided Delivery (SCAD) platform which enables duplex RNA delivery by conjugating it to an accessory oligonucleotide (ACO), which acts as an aptamer to mediate protein binding and facilitate cellular uptake. Through extensive screening, we identified an optimal SCAD architecture that demonstrates enhanced cell-free protein binding and in vitro activity. In rodent models, local administration of SCAD-siRNA conjugates resulted in broad biodistribution throughout the CNS and sustained mRNA knockdown for over five months, with a favorable safety profile. The SCAD platform also exhibited efficient delivery to other tissues, including the eye, the lung and the joint. These features support its potential for broader clinical applications, as evidenced by an ongoing trial targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with mutations in the SOD1 gene. The modular design of SCAD allows it to easily adapt to any duplex RNA, making it a powerful tool for advancing oligonucleotide therapeutics.

">Retrograde transport of neurotrophin receptor TrkB-FL induced by excitotoxicity regulates Golgi stability and is a target for stroke neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                Excitotoxicity, aberrant function of survival pathways dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and disruption of the Golgi complex are shared pathological hallmarks of relevant chronic and acute neurological diseases, including stroke. However, precise interdependence among these mechanisms is not completely defined, a knowledge essential to develop neuroprotective strategies. For ischemic stroke, a leading cause of death, disability and dementia, promising results have been obtained by interfering excitotoxicity, major mechanism of neuronal death in the penumbra area surrounding the infarct. We are exploring neuroprotection by promotion of survival cascades dependent on BDNF binding to full-length tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB-FL) receptor, which become aberrant after excitotoxicity induction. We have previously developed a blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeable neuroprotective peptide (MTFL457) containing a TrkB-FL sequence which efficiently prevents receptor processing induced by excitotoxicity and preserves BDNF-dependent pathways in a model of ischemia, where it efficiently decreases infarct size and improves neurological outcome after stroke. In this work, using cellular and animal models, we demonstrate that excitotoxicity-induced TrkB-FL downregulation is secondary to receptor endocytosis, receptor interaction with endosomal protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), retrograde transport to the Golgi and disruption of this organelle. Interestingly, peptide MTFL457 efficiently interferes TrkB-FL/Hrs interaction and receptor trafficking, processes required for excitotoxic Golgi fragmentation and TrkB-FL cleavage, demonstrating a central role for TrkB-FL in the control of Golgi stability. These results also suggest the potential of peptide MTFL457 to preserve function of this organelle and of critical neuronal survival pathways in stroke and, probably, other neurodegenerative diseases associated to excitotoxicity.

">Maladaptation of Memory Systems Impairs Dorsal CA1-Dependent Temporal Binding and Declarative Memory in The Cntnap2 Knockout Mouse Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                The CA1 region of the hippocampus plays a multifaceted role in cognitive functions related to temporal binding, spatial navigation, and social interactions. Growing evidence reports a role of the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder, particularly in social interactions and cognitive domains. Yet, the mechanisms driving hippocampal-driven cognitive impairments remain poorly defined. Here, we characterized how dorsal CA1 dysfunction impacts the long term retention of temporally discontiguous events. We found that Cntnap2 knockout mice exhibit reduced temporal binding capabilities compared to controls, stemming from decreased dorsal CA1 activity during temporal gaps. We further demonstrate a deficit of the flexibility component of relational/declarative memory in Cntnap2 KO mice. This impairment was secondary to the use of a procedural learning strategy associated with the imbalance of memory systems, in favor of the activity of the frontal-striatal areas, instead of the hippocampus. This study offers deeper insights into how memory systems are mistuned in autism, opening new avenues for understanding and addressing atypical cognition in this condition.

">Slit regulates compartment-specific targeting of dendrites and axons in the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Proper functioning of the nervous system requires precise neuronal connections at subcellular domains, which can be achieved by projection of axons or dendrites to subcellular domains of target neurons. Here we studied subcellular-specific targeting of dendrites and axons in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), where mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and local dopaminergic neurons (DAN) project their dendrites and axons, respectively, to specific compartments of MB axons. Through genetic ablation, we demonstrate that compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons involves mutual repulsion of MBON dendrites and/or DAN axons between neighboring compartments. We further show that Slit expressed in subset of DANs mediates such repulsion by acting through different Robo receptors in different neurons. Loss of Slit-mediated repulsion leads to projection of MBON dendrites and DAN axons into neighboring compartments, resulting formation of ectopic synaptic contacts between MBONs and DANs and changes in olfactory-associative learning. Together, our findings suggest that Slit-mediated repulsion controls compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons, which ensures precise connections between MBON dendrites and DAN axons and proper learning and memory formation.

">Transcranial Brain-Wide Functional Ultrasound and Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in Mice using Multilinear Probes</a></h4>

              
                Functional ultrasound imaging (fUS) and ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) are advanced ultrasound imaging modalities for assessing both functional and anatomical characteristics of the brain. However, the application of these techniques at a whole-brain scale has been limited by technological challenges. While conventional linear acoustic probes provide a narrow 2D field of view and matrix probes lack sufficient sensitivity for 3D transcranial fUS, multilinear probes have been developed to combine high sensitivity to blood flow with fast 3D acquisitions. In this study, we present a novel approach the combined implementation of transcranial whole-brain fUS and ULM in mice using a motorized multilinear probe. This technique provides high-resolution, non-invasive imaging of neurovascular dynamics across the entire brain. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between absolute cerebral blood volume ({Delta}CBV) increases and microbubble velocity, indicating vessel-level dependency of the evoked response. However, the lack of correlation with relative CBV (rCBV) suggests that fUS cannot distinguish functional responses alterations across different arterial vascular compartments. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of neurovascular coupling and could be applied in brain disease diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring.

">An fMRI-based Approach for Measuring Contrast Sensitivity Across the Visual Field in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral vision is crucial for daily activities and quality of life, yet traditional measures of visual function like visual acuity primarily assess central vision. Visual field tests can evaluate peripheral vision but require extended focus combined with precise fixation, often very challenging for patients with severe sight loss. Functional MRI (fMRI) with population receptive field (pRF) mapping offers a non-invasive way to map scotomas but is limited by its reliance on single contrast levels and the necessity of accurate fixation. We developed an fMRI-based approach to measure contrast sensitivity across the visual field without the need for precise fixation. By combining large-field stimulation with varying spatial frequencies and contrast levels with either pRF mapping or a retinotopic atlas based on anatomical landmarks, we modeled contrast sensitivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) over a large (40 deg) expanse of the visual field. In seven normal-sighted participants, we characterized differences in V1 cortical sensitivity across eccentricities and visual quadrants, finding reliable and reproducible patterns of sensitivity differences at individual and session levels. Additionally, our method effectively visualized cases of simulated and disease-linked sensitivity loss at the cortical level. Crucially, we demonstrated that these results could be largely recovered using a structure-based retinotopic atlas, eliminating the need for pRF mapping and precise fixation - although such an approach reduced sensitivity. This approach, integrating large-field stimulation with a retinotopic atlas, offers a promising tool for monitoring vision loss and recovery in patients with various visual impairments, addressing a significant challenge in current clinical assessments.

">Quantification of the effect of hemodynamic occlusion in two-photon imaging</a></h4>

              
                The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of tools available to measure neuronal activity using fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2021). When performed in vivo, these measurements are invariably contaminated by hemodynamic occlusion artifacts. In widefield calcium imaging, this problem is well recognized. For two-photon imaging, however, the effects of hemodynamic occlusion have only been sparsely characterized. Here we perform a quantification of hemodynamic occlusion effects using measurements of fluorescence changes observed with GFP expression using both widefield and two-photon imaging. We find that in many instances the magnitude of signal changes attributable to hemodynamic occlusion is comparable to that observed with activity sensors. Moreover, we find that hemodynamic occlusion effects were spatially heterogeneous, both over cortical regions and across cortical depth, and exhibited a complex relationship with behavior. Thus, hemodynamic occlusion is an important caveat to consider when analyzing and interpreting not just widefield but also two-photon imaging data.

">Resistance of E2F4DN to p38MAPK phosphorylation attenuates DNA damage-induced neuronal death via Cited2</a></h4>

              
                E2F4, a transcription factor with a prominent role in cell homeostasis, can be phosphorylated by the stress kinase p38MAPK at the Thr248/Thr250 motif, while the Thr248Ala/Thr250Ala E2F4 mutant (E2F4DN) triggers multifactorial therapeutic effects in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that the mechanism of action of this therapy relays on the phosphorylation of the Thr248/Thr250 motif under stress conditions, which prevents the homeostatic function of E2F4, while exogenous E2F4DN expression can restore this function. To provide support to this hypothesis, we have focused on genotoxicity induced by camptothecin (CPT) in N2a neuroblastoma-derived neurons, as a paradigm of cell stress followed by cell death. Here we show that, in these cells, p38MAPK becomes activated 6 h after CPT treatment, followed by E2F4 phosphorylation in the Thr248/Thr250 motif. The effect of this phosphorylation in apoptosis was tested by overexpressing wild-type E2F4 (E2F4WT), its Thr248Glu/Thr250Glu phosphomimetic (E2F4CA) or E2F4DN in CPT-treated N2a neurons, followed by quantification of procaspase-3 cleavage. E2F1, which was used as a positive control, induced a statistically-significant increase of procaspase-3 cleavage 32 h after CPT treatment. This was mimicked by either E2F4WT or E2F4CA, while E2F4DN expression inhibited this effect through a Cited2-dependent mechanism. Pharmacological p38MAPK inhibition prevented cell death by E2F4WT but not by E2F4CA, confirming the requirement of E2F4 phosphorylation for cell death in these cells. We conclude that the phosphorylation of E2F4 facilitates the death of N2a neurons carrying DNA damage, while E2F4DN maintains the homeostatic function of E2F4 under stress conditions.

">Pup defence in lactating rats: The underlying neuropeptide signalling and their interactions in the nucleus accumbens shell</a></h4>

              
                Maternal aggression is a core feature of rodent maternal behaviour to defend their offspring from potential threats and is modulated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and oxytocin (OXT) systems signalling. Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF- receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self- grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others. In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour.

                Emotional well-being improves with age, but how neural activity related to emotional brain states changes with aging remains unclear. This study examined individualized brain activation patterns for rumination, worry, and positive thinking to explore age-related variations in emotional state representation. Thirty-five participants (aged 18-64) recalled autobiographical events tied to these emotional states during fMRI scanning. Brain activity was analyzed using an individualized machine learning classifier. Results showed increased discriminability of rumination and worry with age, with older adults exhibiting heightened activation in cognitive control regions during rumination and reduced activation in the cingulate and temporoparietal junction during worry. No significant age-related changes were found for positive thinking, although increased discriminability between positive and negative states correlated with well-being (FDR < 0.05). These findings suggest that aging enhances cognitive control during rumination and reduces anxiety responses during worry, potentially contributing to improved emotional well-being in older adults.

                Locomotion is continuously regulated by an animals position within an environment relative to goals. Direct and indirect pathway striatal output neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) influence locomotion, but how their activity is naturally coordinated by changing environments is unknown. We found, in head-fixed mice, that the relative balance of dSPN and iSPN activity was dynamically modulated with respect to position within a visually-guided locomotor trajectory to retrieve reward. Imbalances were present within ensembles of position-tuned SPNs which were sensitive to the visual environment. Our results suggest a model in which competitive imbalances in striatal output are created by learned associations with sensory input to shape context dependent locomotion.

">Task-irrelevant features in working memory alter current visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Higher-level cognition depends on visual working memory (VWM), the ability of our brain to maintain and manipulate internal representations of images that are no longer presented to us. An important question in this field is whether VWM is represented in a sensory or nonsensory manner. Progress has been made in understanding the features to be remembered, but the representational nature of the memory-irrelevant features is unclear. Here, we used a dual-task paradigm to investigate how and when the memory-irrelevant features interact with the concurrent visual information. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to perform a visual search task (Experiment 1) or a perceptual discrimination task (Experiments 2 and 3) involving a memory irrelevant feature while simultaneously holding the other feature for later retrieval. Experiment 1 showed that VWM biases the allocation of attention to color matching to the memory-irrelevant color. More importantly, the degree of VWM-biased attention decreased monotonically with decreasing feature similarity, and this behavioral monotonic gradient profile resembled the tuning curve of feature-selective neurons in the early visual cortex. Experiment 2 revealed that irrelevant features biased ongoing perception, as indicated by the shifted discrimination threshold. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that VWM-biased perception occurs only at short delays but not at prolonged delays. Our results suggest that the memory-irrelevant feature is represented as a sensory analog for a limited period of time in the visual areas where it was initially processed. Our results extend sensory recruitment theory to memory-irrelevant features in VWM.

">Ictal-Related Chirp as a Biomarker for Monitoring Seizure Progression</a></h4>

              
                Despite being prevalent, the causes, mechanisms, and progression of epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder with unprovoked seizures, are not well understood, complicating drug development for treatment. This study used a comprehensive mouse epilepsy kindling model dataset to investigate frequency modulation (chirp) as a potential indicator of distinct states of epilepsy (early evoked discharge, late evoked discharge, spontaneous recurrent seizure, and drug state). Employing time-frequency ridge extraction, chirp identification, and statistical testing, our analyses revealed that chirp patterns occur in the majority of ictal discharges (>81.6%), persisting across evoked and spontaneous seizures. While the focus was on hippocampal recordings, chirps were also detected in the piriform peripheral cortex. Significant frequency and duration changes in chirp patterns during the transition from early to late evoked ictal events suggest their potential as the screening tool for seizure progression. Additionally, detailed analyses illuminate the impact of Lorazepam, a GABA A enhancer, on chirp characteristics, providing insights into how increased inhibitory tone quantifiably influences excitatory-inhibitory balances during seizures.

">A Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface for Enhancing Nostalgia, Well-Being, and Memory Vividness in Young and Elderly Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Music-evoked nostalgia has the potential to assist in recalling autobiographical memories and enhancing well-being. However, nostalgic music preferences vary from person to person, presenting challenges for applying nostalgia-based music interventions in clinical settings, such as a non-pharmacological approach. To address these individual differences, we developed the Nostalgia Brain-Music Interface (N-BMI), a neurofeedback system that recommends nostalgic songs tailored to each individual. This system is based on prediction models of nostalgic feelings, developed by integrating subjective nostalgia ratings, acoustic features and in-ear electroencephalographic (EEG) data during song listening. To test the effects of N-BMI on nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory recall, seventeen elderly and seventeen young participants took part in the study. The N-BMI was personalized for each individual, and songs were recommended under two conditions: the "nostalgia condition", where songs were selected to enhance nostalgic feelings, and the "control condition", to reduce nostalgic feelings. We found nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory vividness were significantly higher after listening to the recommended songs in the nostalgia condition compared to the control condition in both groups. This indicates that the N-BMI enhanced nostalgic feelings, well-being, and memory recall across both groups. The N-BMI paves the way for innovative therapeutic interventions, including non-pharmacological approaches.

">Trading Place for Space: Increasing Location Resolution Reduces Contextual Capacity in Hippocampal Codes</a></h4>

              
                Many animals learn cognitive maps of their environment - a simultaneous representation of context, experience, and position. Place cells in the hippocampus, named for their explicit encoding of position, are believed to be a neural substrate of these maps, with place cell "remapping" explaining how this system can represent different contexts. Briefly, place cells alter their firing properties, or "remap", in response to changes in experiential or sensory cues. Substantial sensory changes, produced, e.g., by moving between environments, cause large subpopulations of place cells to change their tuning entirely. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, we lack explicit calculations of how the contextual capacity of the place cell system changes as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we propose a geometric approach to understanding population level activity of place cells. Using known firing field statistics, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties affect the distances between representations of different environments within firing rate space. Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We identify a fundamental trade-off between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This trade-off is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. We demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework and conclude by discussing how our geometric approach could be extended to include other cell types and abstract spaces.

">Somatomotor disconnection links sleep duration with socioeconomic context, screen time, cognition, and psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sleep is critical for healthy brain development and emotional wellbeing, especially during adolescence when sleep, behavior, and neurobiology are rapidly evolving. Theoretical reviews and empirical research have historically focused on how sleep influences mental health through its impact on higher-order brain systems. No studies have leveraged data-driven network neuroscience methods to uncover interpretable, brain-wide signatures of sleep duration in adolescence, their socio-environmental origins, or their consequences for cognition and mental health. Methods: Here, we implement graph theory and component-based predictive modeling to examine how a multimodal index of sleep duration is associated with intrinsic brain architecture in 3,173 youth (11-12 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study. Results: We demonstrate that network integration/segregation exhibit a strong, generalizable multivariate association with sleep duration. We next identify a single component of brain architecture centered on a single network as the dominant contributor of this relationship. This component is characterized by increasing disconnection of a lower-order system - the somatomotor network - from other systems, with shorter sleep duration. Finally, greater somatomotor disconnection is associated with lower socioeconomic resources, longer screen times, reduced cognitive/academic performance, and elevated externalizing problems. Conclusions: These findings reveal a novel neural signature of shorter sleep in adolescence that is intertwined with environmental risk, cognition, and psychopathology. By robustly elucidating the key involvement of an understudied brain system in sleep, cognition, and psychopathology, this study can inform theoretical and translational research directions on sleep to promote neurobehavioral development and mental health during the adolescent transition.

">Distinct roles of brain network flexibility in motor learning across age</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning is a lifelong process, from infancy through old age. Acquiring new motor skills through repetitive practice requires adjusting motor output in response to sensory input and integrating them to facilitate learning. For this to occur, the central nervous system must flexibly predict and adapt to the dynamic interplay between sensory inputs and motor outputs. Although overall brain function changes with age, it remains unclear how neural flexibility evolves and influences motor learning ability with aging. To address this, we designed a motor learning paradigm involving both younger and older adults and quantitatively assessed neural flexibility from the perspective of functional brain networks, leveraging multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Here we found age-related differences in motor learning properties, brain network flexibility, and their neural relationships. In younger adults, motor learning retention was associated with brain network flexibility during the preparatory period of the task. However, this association was not observed in older adults. Together, our findings establish that brain network flexibility plays a crucial role in acquiring and maintaining new motor skills in younger adults, but this relationship becomes less effective with age.

">Soft biocompatible polymer optical fiber tapers for implantable neural devices</a></h4>

              
                Optical fibers are between the most common implantable devices for delivering light in the nervous system for optogenetics and infrared neural stimulation applications. Tapered optical fibers, in particular, can offer homogeneous light delivery to a large volume and spatially resolved illumination compared to standard flat-cleaved fibers while being minimally invasive. However, the use of tapers for neural applications has up to now been limited to silica optical fibers, whose large Young's modulus can cause detrimental foreign body response in chronic settings. Here, we present the fabrication and optimization of tapered fiber implants based on polymer optical fibers (POFs). After numerically determining the optimal materials and taper geometry, we fabricated two types of POFs by thermal fiber drawing. The fabrication of the taper was achieved by chemical etching of the fibers, for which several solvents previously reported in literature have been tested. The influence of different parameters on the etching process and on the quality of the obtained tapers was also investigated. The large illumination volume of the produced high-quality taper-based implants was finally tested in vitro in a brain phantom.

">Ephrin-mediated dendrite-dendrite repulsion regulates compartment- specific targeting of dendrites in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Neurons often forms synaptic contacts at specific subcellular domains to differentially regulate the activity of target neurons. However, how dendrites are targeted to specific subcellular domains of axons is rarely studied. Here we use Drosophila mushroom body out neurons (MBONs) and local dopaminergic neurons (DANs) as a model system to study how dendrites and axons are targeted to specific subcellular domains (compartments) of mushroom body axonal lobes to form synaptic contacts. We found that Ephrin-mediated dendrite- dendrite repulsion between neighboring compartments restricts the projection of MBON dendrites to their specific compartments and prevents the formation of ectopic synaptic connections with DAN axons in neighboring compartments. Meanwhile, DAN neurons in a subset of compartments may also depend on their partner MBONs for projecting their axons to a specific compartment and cover the same territory as their partner MBON dendrites. Our work reveals that compartment-specific targeting of MBON dendrites and DAN axons is regulated in part by a combination of dendrite-dendrite repulsion between neighboring compartments and dendrite-axon interactions within the same compartment.

">Intra-arterial Deoxyribonuclease therapy improves stroke outcomes in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Futile recanalization affects more than half of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a major factor of microvascular hypoperfusion after stroke. Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) targeting NETs exhibited a neuroprotective effect in young mice with AIS. This study explored a novel direct intra-arterial administration of DNase therapy and its effect in aged mice with AIS. Method: AIS was induced in aged C57BL/6 mice followed by reperfusion and immediate, intra-arterial DNase administration via the internal carotid artery. Cerebral blood flow, neurological function, cerebral infarct volume, and NET markers were examined. Results: Direct intra-arterial DNase therapy significantly increased cerebral blood flow, reduced neurological deficit scores, increased the latency to fall in wire hang test, reduced cerebral infarct volume, and decreased neutrophil and NET count in both the parenchyma and micro vessels in aged mice with AIS compared with age-matched, vehicle controls. Conclusion: Our data is the first to demonstrate that successful, direct intra-arterial DNase therapy provides more efficient cerebral reperfusion and better outcomes after recanalization during the treatment of large vessel occlusion in aged mice. This study provides evidence for the potential clinical application of catheter delivered intra-arterial DNase therapy post-recanalization.

">How relevant is the prior? Bayesian causal inference for dynamic perception in volatile environments</a></h4>

              
                Our brains predict future sensory input based on their current beliefs about the world around us, but interpreting prediction errors can be challenging in a volatile environment because they can be caused by stochastic noise or by outdated predictions. Noisy signals should be integrated with prior beliefs to improve precision, but the two should be segregated when environmental changes render prior beliefs irrelevant. Bayesian inference provides a statistically optimal solution to deal with situations in which there is uncertainty about the cause of the prediction errors. However, the method quickly becomes memory intensive and computationally intractable when applied consecutively. Here, we systematically evaluate the predictive performance of Bayesian causal inference for human perceptual decisions in a spatial prediction task based on noisy audiovisual sequences with occasional changepoints. We elucidate the simplifying assumptions of a previously proposed reduced Bayesian observer model, and we compare it to an extensive set of models based on alternative simplification strategies. Model-free analyses revealed the hallmarks of Bayesian causal inference: participants seem to have integrated sensory evidence with prior beliefs to improve accuracy when prediction errors were small, and prior influence gradually decreased as prediction errors grew larger, signalling probable irrelevance of the prior due to a changepoint. Model comparison results further supported the hypotheses that participants computed probability-weighted averages over the causal options (noise or changepoint) and that they iteratively summarized their beliefs while accounting for causal uncertainty akin to the reduced Bayesian observer model. However, we also found that participants' reliance on prior beliefs was systematically smaller than predicted by the model, and this was best explained by individually fitting lower-than-optimal parameters for the a-priori probability of prior relevance. We conclude that perceptual belief updating in volatile environments with stochastic noise is well described by a simplified model of consecutive Bayesian causal inference. Observers utilize priors flexibly to the extent that they are deemed relevant, though also conservatively with a lower tendency to bind than an ideal Bayesian observer.

">Neurodegeneration impairs the consolidation of developmentally synchronized behavioral patterns</a></h4>

              
                Animals generate predictable patterns of behavior that are robustly synchronized with the developmental clock. However, the long-term establishment of time-locked behaviors across development, and the neuronal alterations that may impair them, remain underexplored. Here, by quantifying the temporal synchronization of behavior in multiple isolated C. elegans individuals throughout their complete development time, we show that robust behavioral synchronization consolidates across stages as development progresses. Analyses of multiple mutant populations with perturbed neuronal function or structure reveal that neurodegeneration in specific circuits impairs the developmental organization of behavior. In one of the cases, protection from neurodegeneration of the circuit of touch receptor neurons restored normal modes of long-term behavior. Moreover, at the neuronal activity level, we found altered activity patterns in downstream motor neurons following neurodegeneration. These results suggest the impairment of developmental patterns of synchronized behavior by localized neurodegenerative processes within the nervous system.

	<p>Background: The dopaminergic theory, the oldest and most comprehensively analyzed neurotransmitter theory of schizophrenia, remains a focal point of research. Methods: This systematic review examines the association between combinations of 14 dopaminergic genes and the risk of schizophrenia. The selected genes include dopamine receptors (DRD1&amp;amp;ndash;5), metabolizing enzymes (COMT, MAOA, MAOB, DBH), synthesizing enzymes (TH, DDC), and dopamine transporters (DAT, VMAT1, and VMAT2). Results: Recurring functional patterns show combinations with either hyperdopaminergic effects in limbic and striatal regions or high striatal and low prefrontal dopamine levels. The protective statuses of certain alleles or genotypes are often maintained in epistatic effects; however, exceptions exist. This complexity could explain the inconsistent results in previous genetic studies. Investigating individual alleles may be insufficient due to the heterozygous advantage observed in some studies. Conclusions: Schizophrenia may not be a monolithic disease, but rather a sum of different phenotypes which respond uniquely to different treatment and prevention approaches.</p>

	<p>Background: The localization of seizure onset zones (SOZs) is a critical step before the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Methods and Results: In this paper, we propose an SOZ detection method based on convolutional neural networks and EEG signals. This method aims to locate SOZs through the seizure status of each channel in multi-channel EEG signals. First, we preprocess the data with filtering, segmentation, resampling, and standardization to ensure their quality and consistency. Then, the single-channel UCI epilepsy seizure recognition dataset is used to train and test the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, achieving an accuracy of 98.70%, a sensitivity of 97.53%, and a specificity of 98.98%. Next, the multi-channel clinical EEG dataset collected by a hospital is divided into 21 single-channel site datasets and input into the model for detection, and then the seizure results of 21 sites per second are obtained. Finally, the seizure sites are visualized through the international 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system electrode distribution map, diagrams of the change process of the seizure sites during seizures are drawn, and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; SOZs are located. Conclusions: Our proposed method well classifies seizure and non-seizure data and successfully locates SOZs by detecting the seizure results of 21 sites through a single-channel model. This study can effectively assist doctors in locating the SOZs of patients and provide help for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults exhibit core and comorbid features that can have an impact on their daily functioning and lead to considerable psychological distress. Significant and consistent associations have been identified between autism characteristics&amp;amp;mdash;restricted repetitive behaviors and sensory features&amp;amp;mdash;and high levels of stress and anxiety. For a better understanding of the issue, it is necessary to consider the cognitive aspects that can help explain variations in stress and anxiety levels among adults with autism. We therefore aimed to model the contributions of worry and intolerance of uncertainty on the relationship between autism characteristics (sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors) and psychological distress (stress and anxiety). Methods: The sample comprised 144 autistic individuals with a mean age of 35.15 (SD = 11.44). They participated in the study by completing an online questionnaire to assess the study variables. Most of the participants reported being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (63.6%) or Level 1 autism spectrum disorder (27.1%). Results: The model fit index values tested through path analysis indicated a good fit (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 5.65; p = 0.13 ns; CFI = 0.993; NFI = 0.985; RMSEA = 0.079; SRMR = 0.025) and identified worry and intolerance of uncertainty as significant mediating variables within a comprehensive explanatory model. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of worry and intolerance of uncertainty as specific targets in interventions aimed at improving stress and anxiety problems in autistic adults.</p>

	<p>Background: The single-channel sleep EEG has the advantages of convenient collection, high-cost performance, and easy daily use, and it has been widely used in the classification of sleep stages. Methods: This paper proposes a single-channel sleep EEG classification method based on long short-term memory and a hidden Markov model (LSTM-HMM). First, the single-channel EEG is decomposed using wavelet transform (WT), and multi-domain features are extracted from the component signals to characterize the EEG characteristics fully. Considering the temporal nature of sleep stage changes, this paper uses a multi-step time series as the input for the model. After that, the multi-step time series features are input into the LSTM. Finally, the HMM improves the classification results, and the final prediction results are obtained. Results: A complete experiment was conducted on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. The results show that the proposed method can extract deep information from EEG and make full use of the sleep stage transition rule. The proposed method shows the best performance in single-channel sleep EEG classification; the accuracy, macro average F1 score, and kappa are 82.71%, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed method can realize single-channel sleep EEG classification and provide a reference for other EEG classifications.</p>

	<p>Background: The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are very rare lysosomal diseases. MPSs belong to inherited diseases; however, newborns are usually asymptomatic. A deficiency of one of the enzymes, which is responsible for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) catabolism, results in the accumulation of this material. GAGs lead to progressive damage to tissues. More than 90% of patients with MPS suffer from otitis media with effusion or recurrent otitis media, craniofacial dysmorphia, obstructive sleep apnea, different types of hearing loss, and progressive upper and lower airway dysfunction. Patients visit otolaryngologists often before the diagnosis of MPS. Thus, the awareness of symptoms of MPS is crucial for otolaryngologists and pediatricians. The earlier the diagnosis is made, the more effective treatment is. Ineffective or delayed treatment leads to premature death. Two principal treatments for MPS are currently available: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in gene therapy as a potential treatment for patients with MPS. Mortality in patients with MPS typically occurs during childhood and early adolescence as a consequence of upper and lower respiratory diseases. Methods: This systematic review is based on papers available in the following scientific databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results: After screening, 72 articles met our inclusion criteria. Conclusions: It is of paramount importance that otolaryngologists are involved in this field. This narrative review examines and synthesizes the otolaryngologic issues encountered in patients with MPS.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep is one of the most essential processes for sustaining cognitive, emotional, and physical health across all age groups. Insomnia or inadequate sleep significantly impacts health and poses economic burdens due to increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity. Objectives and Methods: This study aimed to investigate sleep quality in the Romanian active population using an online survey incorporating the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Conducted over four months in 2023, the survey gathered 2243 complete responses from urban and rural residents over the age of 18. Results: The results highlight gender and urban&amp;amp;ndash;rural disparities in sleep quality, revealing that females and urban residents experienced poorer sleep compared to their counterparts. Additionally, sleep quality was found to significantly worsen with age, with elders (56+ years) reporting the highest PSQI scores, indicating greater sleep difficulties compared to middle-aged adults and youngsters. A high prevalence of sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunctions, and sleep medication use was reported. Common pre-sleep activities included using electronic devices and watching TV, while fewer participants engaged in reading books or consuming alcohol and caffeine. Additionally, participants&amp;amp;rsquo; bedding preferences were documented. Conclusions: Our study highlights the influence of various factors on sleep quality and emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions to improve sleep health in Romania.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Since the Act for Eliminating Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities was enacted in 2016, the number of students with disabilities in higher education institutions has increased significantly, creating a greater need for support. Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) often coexists with other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and reading and writing difficulties; yet, awareness of DCD remains low. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of DCD traits among Japanese higher education students and their relationship with ADHD, ASD, and reading and writing support needs Methods: A pilot study was conducted with 77 university students (mean age: 19.17 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.68) in the Kansai region, using the Adolescents and Adults Coordination Questionnaire (AAC-Q) to screen for DCD traits, along with a questionnaire assessing difficulties related to ADHD and ASD, and a survey on reading and writing support needs. Results: The study found that 12.9% of students scored more than 1 standard deviation above the mean on the AAC-Q. Students in the DCD trait group (n = 10) reported greater difficulties related to ADHD and ASD than those in the non-DCD group (n = 67). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate-to-strong association between AAC-Q scores and difficulties related to ADHD and ASD among students in the DCD trait group. Conclusions: This study suggests the need to raise awareness about DCD traits and to provide comprehensive support for students with ADHD and ASD in Japanese higher education institutions.</p>

	<p>Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21 or T21) and is associated with an increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), also known as DS-associated AD (DSAD). Individuals with DS typically develop amyloid neuropathology in their late-thirties to early-forties and the mean age of onset of clinical dementia is approximately 55 years. Recent advances in AD clinical research have focused on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques as a potential therapeutic approach. Therefore, there has been guarded enthusiasm about using anti-amyloid mAbs in the prevention/treatment of DSAD. This narrative review and perspective explores the current understanding of amyloid pathology in AD and DSAD, the rationale for using anti-amyloid mAbs in the treatment of DSAD, and the challenges and opportunities for research toward the application of this therapeutic strategy to older adults with DS.</p>

	<p>Background: Speech production is a possible way to monitor bulbar and respiratory functions in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, the emergence of smartphone-based data collection offers a promising approach to reduce frequent hospital visits and enhance patient outcomes. Here, we studied the relationship between bulbar and respiratory functions with voice characteristics of ALS patients, alongside a speech therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s evaluation, at the convenience of using a simple smartphone. Methods: For voice assessment, we considered a speech therapist&amp;amp;rsquo;s standardized tool&amp;amp;mdash;consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice (CAPE-V); and an acoustic analysis toolbox. The bulbar sub-score of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) was used, and pulmonary function measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC%), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP%), and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP%). Correlation coefficients and both linear and logistic regression models were applied. Results: A total of 27 ALS patients (12 males; 61 years mean age; 28 months median disease duration) were included. Patients with significant bulbar dysfunction revealed greater CAPE-V scores in overall severity, roughness, strain, pitch, and loudness. They also presented slower speaking rates, longer pauses, and higher jitter values in acoustic analysis (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The CAPE-V&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall severity and sub-scores for pitch and loudness demonstrated significant correlations with MIP% and MEP% (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In contrast, acoustic metrics (speaking rate, absolute energy, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio) significantly correlated with FVC% (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The results provide supporting evidence for the use of smartphone-based recordings in ALS patients for CAPE-V and acoustic analysis as reliable correlates of bulbar and respiratory function.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Childhood maltreatment has been linked to numerous adverse outcomes in adulthood, including problem substance use. However, not all individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment develop substance use problems, indicating the role of other factors in influencing this outcome. Past work suggests that adverse early life experiences, including childhood maltreatment, lead to neurobiological changes in frontolimbic functions that, in turn, result in altered stress and reward responses, heightened impulsivity, affect dysregulation, and, ultimately, increased risk for maladaptive behaviors such as substance use. The aim of this preliminary investigation using cross-sectional data was to test associations between these factors in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use problems in a sample of emerging adults. Methods: Emerging adults (18&amp;amp;ndash;30 years old) who identified as regular drinkers (i.e., drinking at least 2&amp;amp;ndash;4 times in the past month) were recruited from a crowd-sourcing platform (Prolific) as well as community samples. Participants completed online standardized questionnaires assessing reward sensitivity and responsiveness, impulsivity, emotion regulation, and alcohol consequences. Results: Path analyses demonstrated good fit for the data (SRMR = 0.057, RMSEA = 0.096, 90% CI [0.055, 0.142], CFI = 0.957). Childhood maltreatment was associated with reward responsiveness (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.026, Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.222, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and emotion dysregulation (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.669, Z = 9.633, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), which in turn was associated with urgency and, subsequently, alcohol consequences (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.758, Z = 7.870, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Although these findings are preliminary, the current study is one of the first to test a comprehensive model addressing the relationship between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use problems. The findings have the potential to inform treatment strategies that target motivation and goal-directed action for reducing and managing consequences associated with childhood maltreatment. Future research should test the model using longitudinal data to address the limitations of a cross-sectional study and assess temporal associations between constructs.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; intention understanding ability reflects their professional insight, which is the basis for effective classroom teaching activities. However, the cognitive process and brain mechanism of how teachers understand students&amp;amp;rsquo; action intention in class are still unclear. Methods: This study used event-related potential (ERP) technology to explore the cognitive neural differences in intention understanding ability among teachers with different levels of knowledge and experience. The experiment used the comic strips paradigm to examine the ability of expert and novice teachers to understand students&amp;amp;rsquo; normative and non-normative classroom actions under different text prompts (&amp;amp;ldquo;how&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;why&amp;amp;rdquo;). Results: The results revealed that in the late time window, expert teachers induced larger P300 and LPC amplitudes when they understood students&amp;amp;rsquo; classroom action intentions, while the N250 amplitudes induced by novice teachers in the early time window were significantly larger. In addition, for both types of teachers, when understanding the intentions behind students&amp;amp;rsquo; normative actions, the N250 amplitude was the most significant, while the P300 and LPC amplitudes were more significant for non-normative actions. Conclusions: This study found that teachers at varying professional development stages had different time processing processes in intention understanding ability, which supported teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; brain electrophysiological activities related to social ability.</p>

	<p>Background: Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of long-term music training (i.e., musicianship) on the neural processing of sound, including simple tones and speech. However, the effects of musicianship on the encoding of simultaneously presented pitches, in the form of complex musical chords, is less well established. Presumably, musicians&amp;amp;rsquo; stronger familiarity and active experience with tonal music might enhance harmonic pitch representations, perhaps in an attention-dependent manner. Additionally, attention might influence chordal encoding differently across the auditory system. To this end, we explored the effects of long-term music training and attention on the processing of musical chords at the brainstem and cortical levels. Method: Young adult participants were separated into musician and nonmusician groups based on the extent of formal music training. While recording EEG, listeners heard isolated musical triads that differed only in the chordal third: major, minor, and detuned (4% sharper third from major). Participants were asked to correctly identify chords via key press during active stimulus blocks and watched a silent movie during passive blocks. We logged behavioral identification accuracy and reaction times and calculated information transfer based on the behavioral chord confusion patterns. EEG data were analyzed separately to distinguish between cortical (event-related potential, ERP) and subcortical (frequency-following response, FFR) evoked responses. Results: We found musicians were (expectedly) more accurate, though not faster, than nonmusicians in chordal identification. For subcortical FFRs, responses showed stimulus chord effects but no group differences. However, for cortical ERPs, whereas musicians displayed P2 (~150 ms) responses that were invariant to attention, nonmusicians displayed reduced P2 during passive listening. Listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; degree of behavioral information transfer (i.e., success in distinguishing chords) was also better in musicians and correlated with their neural differentiation of chords in the ERPs (but not high-frequency FFRs). Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest long-term music training strengthens even the passive cortical processing of musical sounds, supporting more automated brain processing of musical chords with less reliance on attention. Our results also suggest that the degree to which listeners can behaviorally distinguish chordal triads is directly related to their neural specificity to musical sounds primarily at cortical rather than subcortical levels. FFR attention effects were likely not observed due to the use of high-frequency stimuli (&amp;amp;gt;220 Hz), which restrict FFRs to brainstem sources.</p>

     alt="A Novel Mouse Model for Cerebral Inflammatory Demyelination in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy: Insights into Pathogenesis and Potential Therapeutic Targets"/>

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in <i>ABCD1</i>, a peroxisomal gene. More than half of males with an <i>ABCD1</i> mutation develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cALD), but underlying mechanisms remain unknown and therapies are limited. We sought to develop and characterize a mouse model of cALD to facilitate study of disease mechanisms and therapy development.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used immunoassays and immunohistochemistry to assess novel (interleukin 18 [IL-18]) and established molecular markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain tissue from cALD patients. We generated a cALD phenotype in <i>Abcd1-</i>knockout mice using a 2-hit method that combines cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. We then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry to assess the fidelity of cALD molecular markers in the mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Human and mouse cALD lesions shared histologic features of myelin phagocytosis, myelin loss, abundant microglial activation, T and B-cell infiltration, and astrogliosis. Compared to wild-type controls, <i>Abcd1</i>-knockout mice displayed more cerebral demyelination, blood–brain barrier disruption, and perivascular immune cell infiltration. This enhanced inflammatory response was associated with higher levels of fibrin deposition, oxidative stress, demyelination, and axonal injury. IL-18 immunoreactivity co-localized with perivascular monocytes/macrophages in both human and mouse brain tissue. In cALD patients, CSF IL-18 levels correlated with MRI lesion severity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest loss of <i>Abcd1</i> function in mice predisposes to more severe blood–brain barrier disruption, cerebral inflammation driven by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, demyelination, and axonal damage, replicating human cALD features. This novel mouse model could shed light on cALD mechanisms and accelerate cALD therapy development. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>
