	<p>Drug addiction is thought to be driven by negative reinforcement, and it is thought that a shift from positive affect upon initial exposure to negative affect after chronic exposure to a drug is responsible for maintaining self-administration (SA) in addicted individuals. This can be modeled in rats by analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a type of intraspecies communication indicative of affective state based on the frequency of the emission: calls in the 22 kHz range indicate negative affect, whereas calls in the 50 kHz range indicate positive affect. We employed a voluntary chronic, long-access model of fentanyl SA to analyze affective changes in the response to chronic fentanyl exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered either fentanyl (N = 7) or saline (N = 6) for 30 consecutive days and USVs were recorded at four different time points: the day before first SA session (PRE), the first day of SA (T01), the last day of SA (T30), and the first day of abstinence (ABS). At T01, the ratio of 50 to 22 kHz calls was similar between the fentanyl and saline groups, but at T30, the ratio differed between groups, with the fentanyl group showing significantly fewer 50 kHz calls and more 22 kHz calls relative to saline animals. These results indicate a shift toward a negative affect during drug use after chronic exposure to fentanyl and support negative reinforcement as a main driving factor of opioid addiction.</p>

	<p>Functional neuroimaging studies have highlighted the roles of three networks in processing language, all of which are typically left-lateralized: a ventral stream involved in semantics, a dorsal stream involved in phonology and speech production, and a more dorsal “multiple demand” network involved in many effortful tasks. As lateralization in all networks may be affected by life factors such as age, literacy, education, and brain pathology, we sought to develop a task paradigm with which to investigate the engagement of these networks, including manipulations to selectively emphasize semantic and phonological processing within a single task performable by almost anyone regardless of literacy status. In young healthy participants, we administered an auditory word monitoring task, in which participants had to note the occurrence of a target word within a continuous story presented in either their native language, Portuguese, or the unknown language, Japanese. Native language task performance activated ventral stream language networks, left lateralized but bilateral in the anterior temporal lobe. Unfamiliar language performance, being more difficult, activated left hemisphere dorsal stream structures and the multiple demand network bilaterally, but predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that increased demands on phonological processing to accomplish word monitoring in the absence of semantic support may result in the bilateral recruitment of networks involved in speech perception under more challenging conditions.</p>

                We study an analog of Serre’s modularity conjecture for projective representations ρ¯:Gal(K¯/K)→PGL2(k), where K is a totally real number field. We prove cases of this conjecture when k=F5.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular phenotyping reveals the identity of Barretts esophagus and its malignant transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The origin of human metaplastic states and their propensity for cancer is poorly understood. Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.</p>

                <p>CRISPR-associated transposition systems allow guide RNA&ndash;directed integration of a single DNA cargo in one orientation at a fixed distance from a programmable target sequence. We used cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate&ndash;bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP&bull;AlF<SUB>3</SUB>. These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>The oomycete <I>Phytophthora infestans</I> is a damaging crop pathogen and a model organism to study plant-pathogen interactions. We report the discovery of a family of copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in plant pathogenic oomycetes and its role in plant infection by <I>P. infestans</I>. We show that LPMO-encoding genes are up-regulated early during infection and that the secreted enzymes oxidatively cleave the backbone of pectin, a charged polysaccharide in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of the most abundant of these LPMOs sheds light on its ability to recognize and degrade pectin, and silencing the encoding gene in <I>P. infestans</I> inhibits infection of potato, indicating a role in host penetration. The identification of LPMOs as virulence factors in pathogenic oomycetes opens up opportunities in crop protection and food security.</p>

                <p>Harnessing the potential wide-ranging quantum science applications of molecules will require control of their interactions. Here, we used microwave radiation to directly engineer and tune the interaction potentials between ultracold calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. By merging two optical tweezers, each containing a single molecule, we probed collisions in three dimensions. The correct combination of microwave frequency and power created an effective repulsive shield, which suppressed the inelastic loss rate by a factor of six, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The demonstrated microwave shielding shows a general route to the creation of long-lived, dense samples of ultracold polar molecules and evaporative cooling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Chemically recyclable thermoplastics from reversible-deactivation polymerization of cyclic acetals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identifying plastics capable of chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the foremost challenge in creating a sustainable circular plastic economy. Polyacetals are promising candidates for CRM but lack useful tensile strengths owing to the low molecular weights produced using current uncontrolled cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) methods. Here, we present reversible-deactivation CROP of cyclic acetals using a commercial halomethyl ether initiator and an indium(III) bromide catalyst. Using this method, we synthesize poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDXL), which demonstrates tensile strength comparable to some commodity polyolefins. Depolymerization of PDXL using strong acid catalysts returns monomer in near-quantitative yield and even proceeds from a commodity plastic waste mixture. Our efficient polymerization method affords a tough thermoplastic that can undergo selective depolymerization to monomer.</p>

                <p>Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.</p>

                <p>Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).</p>

                <p>Little is known about woolly mammoth (<I>Mammuthus primigenius</I>) mobility and range. Here we use high temporal resolution sequential analyses of strontium isotope ratios along an entire 1.7-meter-long tusk to reconstruct the movements of an Arctic woolly mammoth that lived 17,100 years ago, during the last ice age. We use an isotope-guided random walk approach to compare the tusk&rsquo;s strontium and oxygen isotope profiles to isotopic maps. Our modeling reveals patterns of movement across a geographically extensive range during the animal&rsquo;s ~28-year life span that varied with life stages. Maintenance of this level of mobility by megafaunal species such as mammoth would have been increasingly difficult as the ice age ended and the environment changed at high latitudes.</p>

                <p>Total daily energy expenditure ("total expenditure") reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, but its trajectory over the life course is poorly studied. We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass&ndash;adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to ~50% above adult values at ~1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by ~20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span.</p>

                <p>A Western-style, high-fat diet promotes cardiovascular disease, in part because it is rich in choline, which is converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut microbiota. However, whether diet-induced changes in intestinal physiology can alter the metabolic capacity of the microbiota remains unknown. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet escalates <I>Escherichia coli</I> choline catabolism by altering intestinal epithelial physiology. A high-fat diet impaired the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the colonic epithelium to increase the luminal bioavailability of oxygen and nitrate, thereby intensifying respiration-dependent choline catabolism of <I>E. coli</I>. In turn, <I>E. coli</I> choline catabolism increased levels of circulating trimethlamine <I>N</I>-oxide, which is a potentially harmful metabolite generated by gut microbiota.</p>

We analyzed their effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding, as well as the effects of two of these mutations (K417N and E484K) on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternative binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.</p>

                <p>The emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that are resistant to therapeutic antibodies highlights the need for continuing discovery of broadly reactive antibodies. We identified four receptor binding domain&ndash;targeting antibodies from three early-outbreak convalescent donors with potent neutralizing activity against 23 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.526, and B.1.617 VOCs. Two antibodies are ultrapotent, with subnanomolar neutralization titers [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<SUB>50</SUB>) 0.3 to 11.1 nanograms per milliliter; IC<SUB>80</SUB> 1.5 to 34.5 nanograms per milliliter). We define the structural and functional determinants of binding for all four VOC-targeting antibodies and show that combinations of two antibodies decrease the in vitro generation of escape mutants, suggesting their potential in mitigating resistance development.</p>

                <p>Capturing the heterogeneous phenotypes of microbial populations at relevant spatiotemporal scales is highly challenging. Here, we present par-seqFISH (parallel sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization), a transcriptome-imaging approach that records gene expression and spatial context within microscale assemblies at a single-cell and molecule resolution. We applied this approach to the opportunistic pathogen <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, analyzing about 600,000 individuals across dozens of conditions in planktonic and biofilm cultures. We identified numerous metabolic- and virulence-related transcriptional states that emerged dynamically during planktonic growth, as well as highly spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity in sessile populations. Our data reveal that distinct physiological states can coexist within the same biofilm just several micrometers away, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Our results illustrate the complex dynamics of microbial populations and present a new way of studying them at high resolution.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) acts in part through a family of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), which mediate diverse physiological processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and sensory transduction. Pharmacologically, nAChRs are responsible for tobacco addiction and are targeted by medicines for hypertension and dementia. Nicotinic AChRs were the first ion channels to be isolated. Recent studies have identified molecules that control nAChR biogenesis, trafficking, and function. These nAChR accessories include protein and chemical chaperones as well as auxiliary subunits. Whereas some factors act on many nAChRs, others are receptor specific. Discovery of these regulatory mechanisms is transforming nAChR research in cells and tissues ranging from central neurons to spinal ganglia to cochlear hair cells. Nicotinic AChR&ndash;specific accessories also enable drug discovery on high-confidence targets for psychiatric, neurological, and auditory disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of substance abuse and its associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Substance abuse by medical students poses a significant risk not only on their personal life but also on their professional life by putting their patients at risk. Our study aims to find out the prevalence of substance abuse and factors associated with it among medical students. Methods: A descriptive, online-questionnaire based, cross-sectional study was carried out at Gandaki Medical College, a medical school in Gandaki Province of Nepal. Whole sampling technique was used. SPSS-25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for analyzing demographic and substance abuse related variables. Chi square and Fishers exact test was used to find out if any differences existed in substance abuse by demographic characteristics. Results: Among 420 eligible participants, 219 participated in the survey (response rate: 52.2%). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance with overall lifetime prevalence of 58% followed by cigarette smoking and illegal drug abuse at 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. The abuse of substances was significantly higher (p<0.05) in males, who were offered substances by friends, and amongst study participants who worked with an intoxicated colleague. The most common reason for substance abuse was “For pleasure, curiosity or to go along with friends” (23%, n=18). Major and minor dysfunction due to alcohol abuse was reported by 8(3.7%) and 33(15.1%) participants, while the same dysfunctions due to drug abuse were reported by 1(0.5%) and 14(6.4%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance abuse was high among medical students and was found to be associated with male gender, if offer of substances were made by friends, and amongst those who worked with an intoxicated colleague. This problem of substance abuse among medical students should be addressed timely as failing to do so might have serious consequences on the healthcare system of the country.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeepG4: A deep learning approach to predict cell-type specific active G-quadruplex regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vincent Rocher, Matthieu Genais, Elissar Nassereddine, Raphael Mourad</p>

DNA is a complex molecule carrying the instructions an organism needs to develop, live and reproduce. In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered that DNA is composed of two chains forming a double-helix. Later on, other structures of DNA were discovered and shown to play important roles in the cell, in particular G-quadruplex (G4). Following genome sequencing, several bioinformatic algorithms were developed to map G4s in vitro based on a canonical sequence motif, G-richness and G-skewness or alternatively sequence features including k-mers, and more recently machine/deep learning. Recently, new sequencing techniques were developed to map G4s in vitro (G4-seq) and G4s in vivo (G4 ChIP-seq) at few hundred base resolution. Here, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (DeepG4) to map cell-type specific active G4 regions (<i>e.g</i>. regions within which G4s form both in vitro and in vivo). DeepG4 is very accurate to predict active G4 regions in different cell types. Moreover, DeepG4 identifies key DNA motifs that are predictive of G4 region activity. We found that such motifs do not follow a very flexible sequence pattern as current algorithms seek for. Instead, active G4 regions are determined by numerous specific motifs. Moreover, among those motifs, we identified known transcription factors (TFs) which could play important roles in G4 activity by contributing either directly to G4 structures themselves or indirectly by participating in G4 formation in the vicinity. In addition, we used DeepG4 to predict active G4 regions in a large number of tissues and cancers, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for researchers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying dose-, strain-, and tissue-specific kinetics of parainfluenza virus infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lubna Pinky, Crystal W. Burke, Charles J. Russell, Amber M. Smith</p>

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a leading cause of acute respiratory infection hospitalization in children, yet little is known about how dose, strain, tissue tropism, and individual heterogeneity affects the processes driving growth and clearance kinetics. Longitudinal measurements are possible by using reporter Sendai viruses, the murine counterpart of HPIV 1, that express luciferase, where the insertion location yields a wild-type (rSeV-luc(M-F*)) or attenuated (rSeV-luc(P-M)) phenotype. Bioluminescence from individual animals suggests that there is a rapid increase in expression followed by a peak, biphasic clearance, and resolution. However, these kinetics vary between individuals and with dose, strain, and whether the infection was initiated in the upper and/or lower respiratory tract. To quantify the differences, we translated the bioluminescence measurements from the nasopharynx, trachea, and lung into viral loads and used a mathematical model together a nonlinear mixed effects approach to define the mechanisms distinguishing each scenario. The results confirmed a higher rate of virus production with the rSeV-luc(M-F*) virus compared to its attenuated counterpart, and suggested that low doses result in disproportionately fewer infected cells. The analyses indicated faster infectivity and infected cell clearance rates in the lung and that higher viral doses, and concomitantly higher infected cell numbers, resulted in more rapid clearance. This parameter was also highly variable amongst individuals, which was particularly evident during infection in the lung. These critical differences provide important insight into distinct HPIV dynamics, and show how bioluminescence data can be combined with quantitative analyses to dissect host-, virus-, and dose-dependent effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bistability in fatty-acid oxidation resulting from substrate inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fentaw Abegaz, Anne-Claire M. F. Martines, Marcel A. Vieira Lara, Melany Rios Morales, Dirk-Jan Reijngoud, Ernst C. Wit, Barbara M. Bakker</p>

In this study we demonstrated through analytic considerations and numerical studies that the mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation can exhibit bistable-hysteresis behavior. In an experimentally validated computational model we identified a specific region in the parameter space in which two distinct stable and one unstable steady state could be attained with different fluxes. The two stable states were referred to as low-flux (disease) and high-flux (healthy) state. By a modular kinetic approach we traced the origin and causes of the bistability back to the distributive kinetics and the conservation of CoA, in particular in the last rounds of the β-oxidation. We then extended the model to investigate various interventions that may confer health benefits by activating the pathway, including (i) activation of the last enzyme MCKAT via its endogenous regulator p46-SHC protein, (ii) addition of a thioesterase (an acyl-CoA hydrolysing enzyme) as a safety valve, and (iii) concomitant activation of a number of upstream and downstream enzymes by short-chain fatty-acids (SCFA), metabolites that are produced from nutritional fibers in the gut. A high concentration of SCFAs, thioesterase activity, and inhibition of the p46Shc protein led to a disappearance of the bistability, leaving only the high-flux state. A better understanding of the switch behavior of the mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation process between a low- and a high-flux state may lead to dietary and pharmacological intervention in the treatment or prevention of obesity and or non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational identification and experimental characterization of preferred downstream positions in human core promoters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by René Dreos, Anna Sloutskin, Nati Malachi, Diana Ideses, Philipp Bucher, Tamar Juven-Gershon</p>

Metazoan core promoters, which direct the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), may contain short sequence motifs termed core promoter elements/motifs (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>. the TATA box, initiator (Inr) and downstream core promoter element (DPE)), which recruit Pol II via the general transcription machinery. The DPE was discovered and extensively characterized in <i>Drosophila</i>, where it is strictly dependent on both the presence of an Inr and the precise spacing from it. Since the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE is recognized by the human transcription machinery, it is most likely that some human promoters contain a downstream element that is similar, though not necessarily identical, to the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE. However, only a couple of human promoters were shown to contain a functional DPE, and attempts to computationally detect human DPE-containing promoters have mostly been unsuccessful. Using a newly-designed motif discovery strategy based on Expectation-Maximization probabilistic partitioning algorithms, we discovered preferred downstream positions (PDP) in human promoters that resemble the <i>Drosophila</i> DPE. Available chromatin accessibility footprints revealed that <i>Drosophila</i> and human Inr+DPE promoter classes are not only highly structured, but also similar to each other, particularly in the proximal downstream region. Clustering of the corresponding sequence motifs using a neighbor-joining algorithm strongly suggests that canonical Inr+DPE promoters could be common to metazoan species. Using reporter assays we demonstrate the contribution of the identified downstream positions to the function of multiple human promoters. Furthermore, we show that alteration of the spacing between the Inr and PDP by two nucleotides results in reduced promoter activity, suggesting a spacing dependency of the newly discovered human PDP on the Inr. Taken together, our strategy identified novel functional downstream positions within human core promoters, supporting the existence of DPE-like motifs in human promoters.

Navigation of fast migrating cells such as amoeba <i>Dictyostelium</i> and immune cells are tightly associated with their morphologies that range from steady polarized forms that support high directionality to those more complex and variable when making frequent turns. Model simulations are essential for quantitative understanding of these features and their origins, however systematic comparisons with real data are underdeveloped. Here, by employing deep-learning-based feature extraction combined with phase-field modeling framework, we show that a low dimensional feature space for 2D migrating cell morphologies obtained from the shape stereotype of keratocytes, <i>Dictyostelium</i> and neutrophils can be fully mapped by an interlinked signaling network of cell-polarization and protrusion dynamics. Our analysis links the data-driven shape analysis to the underlying causalities by identifying key parameters critical for migratory morphologies both normal and aberrant under genetic and pharmacological perturbations. The results underscore the importance of deciphering self-organizing states and their interplay when characterizing morphological phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using mobility data in the design of optimal lockdown strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ritabrata Dutta, Susana N. Gomes, Dante Kalise, Lorenzo Pacchiardi</p>

A mathematical model for the COVID-19 pandemic spread, which integrates age-structured Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased dynamics with real mobile phone data accounting for the population mobility, is presented. The dynamical model adjustment is performed via Approximate Bayesian Computation. Optimal lockdown and exit strategies are determined based on nonlinear model predictive control, constrained to public-health and socio-economic factors. Through an extensive computational validation of the methodology, it is shown that it is possible to compute robust exit strategies with realistic reduced mobility values to inform public policy making, and we exemplify the applicability of the methodology using datasets from England and France.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational method for identifying an optimal combination of existing drugs to repair the action potentials of SQT1 ventricular myocytes</a></h4>

Mutations are known to cause perturbations in essential functional features of integral membrane proteins, including ion channels. Even restricted or point mutations can result in substantially changed properties of ion currents. The additive effect of these alterations for a specific ion channel can result in significantly changed properties of the action potential (AP). Both AP shortening and AP prolongation can result from known mutations, and the consequences can be life-threatening. Here, we present a computational method for identifying new drugs utilizing combinations of existing drugs. Based on the knowledge of theoretical effects of existing drugs on individual ion currents, our aim is to compute optimal combinations that can ‘repair’ the mutant AP waveforms so that the baseline AP-properties are restored. More specifically, we compute optimal, combined, drug concentrations such that the waveforms of the transmembrane potential and the cytosolic calcium concentration of the mutant cardiomyocytes (CMs) becomes as similar as possible to their wild type counterparts after the drug has been applied. In order to demonstrate the utility of this method, we address the question of computing an optimal drug for the short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1). For the SQT1 mutation N588K, there are available data sets that describe the effect of various drugs on the mutated K<sup>+</sup> channel. These published findings are the basis for our computational analysis which can identify optimal compounds in the sense that the AP of the mutant CMs resembles essential biomarkers of the wild type CMs. Using recently developed insights regarding electrophysiological properties among myocytes from different species, we compute optimal drug combinations for hiPSC-CMs, rabbit ventricular CMs and adult human ventricular CMs with the SQT1 mutation. Since the ‘composition’ of ion channels that form the AP is different for the three types of myocytes under consideration, so is the composition of the optimal drug.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluation and comparison of multi-omics data integration methods for cancer subtyping</a></h4>

Computational integrative analysis has become a significant approach in the data-driven exploration of biological problems. Many integration methods for cancer subtyping have been proposed, but evaluating these methods has become a complicated problem due to the lack of gold standards. Moreover, questions of practical importance remain to be addressed regarding the impact of selecting appropriate data types and combinations on the performance of integrative studies. Here, we constructed three classes of benchmarking datasets of nine cancers in TCGA by considering all the eleven combinations of four multi-omics data types. Using these datasets, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten representative integration methods for cancer subtyping in terms of accuracy measured by combining both clustering accuracy and clinical significance, robustness, and computational efficiency. We subsequently investigated the influence of different omics data on cancer subtyping and the effectiveness of their combinations. Refuting the widely held intuition that incorporating more types of omics data always produces better results, our analyses showed that there are situations where integrating more omics data negatively impacts the performance of integration methods. Our analyses also suggested several effective combinations for most cancers under our studies, which may be of particular interest to researchers in omics data analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Structures of the mycobacterial membrane protein MmpL3 reveal its mechanism of lipid transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chih-Chia Su, Philip A. Klenotic, Meng Cui, Meinan Lyu, Christopher E. Morgan, Edward W. Yu</p>

The mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) transporter is essential and required for shuttling the lipid trehalose monomycolate (TMM), a precursor of mycolic acid (MA)-containing trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan (mAGP), in <i>Mycobacterium</i> species, including <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i>. However, the mechanism that MmpL3 uses to facilitate the transport of fatty acids and lipidic elements to the mycobacterial cell wall remains elusive. Here, we report 7 structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL3 transporter in its unbound state and in complex with trehalose 6-decanoate (T6D) or TMM using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. Combined with calculated results from molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD simulations, we reveal a lipid transport mechanism that involves a coupled movement of the periplasmic domain and transmembrane helices of the MmpL3 transporter that facilitates the shuttling of lipids to the mycobacterial cell wall.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Global and national trends, gaps, and opportunities in documenting and monitoring species distributions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ruth Y. Oliver, Carsten Meyer, Ajay Ranipeta, Kevin Winner, Walter Jetz</p>

Conserving and managing biodiversity in the face of ongoing global change requires sufficient evidence to assess status and trends of species distributions. Here, we propose novel indicators of biodiversity data coverage and sampling effectiveness and analyze national trajectories in closing spatiotemporal knowledge gaps for terrestrial vertebrates (1950 to 2019). Despite a rapid rise in data coverage, particularly in the last 2 decades, strong geographic and taxonomic biases persist. For some taxa and regions, a tremendous growth in records failed to directly translate into newfound knowledge due to a sharp decline in sampling effectiveness. However, we found that a nation’s coverage was stronger for species for which it holds greater stewardship. As countries under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework renew their commitments to an improved, rigorous biodiversity knowledge base, our findings highlight opportunities for international collaboration to close critical information gaps.

The number of species on Earth is highly uncertain. A recent study has suggested that there are less than 2 million prokaryotic species on Earth; this Formal Comment suggests instead that there are more likely hundreds of millions or billions of species, and that the majority of these are bacteria associated with insects and other animals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Whole genome sequencing of colonies derived from cannabis flowers and the impact of media selection on benchmarking total yeast and mold detection tools [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis products are subjected to microbial testing for human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. These testing requirements often rely on non-specific colony forming unit (CFU/g) specifications without clarity on which medium, selection or growth times are required. We performed whole genome sequencing to assess the specificity of colony forming units (CFU) derived from three different plating media: Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), PDA with chloramphenicol and Dichloran Rose Bengal with chloramphenicol (DRBC). Methods: Colonies were isolated from each medium type and their whole genomes sequenced to identify the diversity of microbes present on each medium selection. Fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS3) and Bacterial 16S RNA(16S) quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were performed, to correlate these CFUs with fungi- and bacterial- specific qPCR. Results: Each plating medium displayed a ten-fold difference in CFU counts. PDA with chloramphenicol showed the highest diversity and the highest concordance with whole genome sequencing. According to ITS3 and 16S qPCR confirmed with whole genome sequencing, DRBC under counted yeast and mold while PDA without chloramphenicol over counted CFUs due to bacterial growth without selection. Conclusions: Colony Forming Unit regulations lack specificity. Each medium produces significant differences in CFU counts. These are further dependent on subjective interpretation, failure to culture most microbes, and poor selection between bacteria and fungi. Given the most human pathogenic microbes found on cannabis are endophytes which culture fails to detect, molecular methods offer a solution to this long-standing quantification problem in the cannabis testing field.

                Background: Land cover/land cover (LULC) change is one of the major contributors to global environmental and climate variations. The ability to predict future LULC is crucial for environmental engineers, civil engineers, urban designers, and natural resources managers for planning activities. Methods: TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling System and ArcGIS Pro 2.8 were used to process LULC data for the region of the Lepelle River Basin (LRB) of South Africa. Driver variables such as population density, slope, elevation as well as the Euclidean distances of cities, roads, highways, railroads, parks and restricted areas, towns to the LRB in combination with LULC data were analysed using the Land Change Modeller (LCM) and Cellular-Automata Markov (CAM) model. Results: The results reveal an array of losses (-) and gains (+) for certain LULC classes in the LRB by the year 2040: natural vegetation (+8.5%), plantations (+3.5%), water bodies (-31.6%), bare ground (-8.8%), cultivated land (-29.3%), built-up areas (+10.6%) and mines (+14.4%). Conclusions: The results point to the conversion of land uses from natural to anthropogenic by 2040. These changes also highlight how the potential losses associated with resources such as water that will negatively impact society and ecosystem functioning in the LRB by exacerbating water scarcity driven by climate change. This modelling study provides a decision support system for the establishment of sustainable land resource utilization policies in the LRB.

<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synapses with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the second optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla, we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades, there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used fourth instar larvae of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Morphological and neurochemical characterization of glycinergic neurons in laminae I-IV of the mouse spinal dorsal horn"/>
<p>Glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I-II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. Based on dendritic morphology, we divided them into three and six groups in laminae I-II and III-IV, respectively. At least one type of neurons in laminae III-IV may project its axon into laminae I-II. We also provided experimental evidence indicating that there are glycine-only neurons and axon terminals in laminae I-II. The glycine-only neurons may express RORβ and/or RET, but there might be other neurochemical markers which are still awaiting identification.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>A growing body of experimental evidence shows that glycinergic inhibition plays vital roles in spinal pain processing. In spite of this, however, our knowledge about the morphology, neurochemical characteristics and synaptic relations of glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn is very limited. The lack of this knowledge makes our understanding about the specific contribution of glycinergic neurons to spinal pain processing quite vague. Here we investigated the morphology and neurochemical characteristics of glycinergic neurons in laminae I-IV of the spinal dorsal horn using a GlyT2::CreERT2-tdTomato transgenic mouse line. Confirming previous reports, we show that glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I-II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. First in the literature, we provide experimental evidence indicating that in addition to neurons in which glycine co-localizes with GABA, there are glycinergic neurons in laminae I-II that do not express GABA and can thus be referred to as glycine-only neurons. According to the shape and size of cell bodies and dendritic morphology, we divided the tdTomato labelled glycinergic neurons into three and six morphological groups in laminae I-II and laminae III-IV, respectively. We also demonstrate that most of the glycinergic neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase, parvalbumin, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET and the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ) but there might be others that need further neurochemical characterization. The present findings may foster our understanding about the contribution of glycinergic inhibition to spinal pain processing.</p>

                Rhoades et al. show that patients acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a distinct nasal microbiome marked by an increase in bacterial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and accompanied by a robust inflammatory host transcriptional response. This provides a potential explanation for the high rate of bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LMO2 is essential to maintain the ability of progenitors to differentiate into T-cell lineage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Notch signaling primarily determines T-cell fate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of T-lineage potential in pre-thymic progenitors remain unclear. Here, we established two murine <i>Ebf1</i>-deficient pro-B cell lines, with and without T-lineage potential. The latter expressed lower levels of <i>Lmo2</i>; their potential was restored via ectopic expression of <i>Lmo2</i>. Conversely, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>Lmo2</i> resulted in the loss of the T-lineage potential. Introduction of <i>Bcl2</i> rescued massive cell death of Notch-stimulated pro-B cells without efficient LMO2-driven <i>Bcl11a</i> expression but was not sufficient to retain their T-lineage potential. Pro-B cells without T-lineage potential failed to activate <i>Tcf7</i> due to DNA methylation; <i>Tcf7</i> transduction restored this capacity. Moreover, direct binding of LMO2 to the <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i> loci was observed. Altogether, our results highlight LMO2 as a crucial player in the survival and maintenance of T-lineage potential in T-cell progenitors via the regulation of the expression of <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gaps in global wildlife trade monitoring leave amphibians vulnerable</a></h4>

              
                As the biodiversity crisis continues, we must redouble efforts to understand and curb pressures pushing species closer to extinction. One major driver is the unsustainable trade of wildlife. Trade in internationally regulated species gains the most research attention, but this only accounts for a minority of traded species and we risk failing to appreciate the scale and impacts of unregulated legal trade. Despite being legal, trade puts pressure on wild species via: direct collection, introduced pathogens, and invasive species. Smaller species-rich vertebrates, such reptiles, fish, and amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to trading because of gaps in regulations, small distributions, and demand of novel species. Here we combine data from five sources: online web searches in six languages, CITES trade database, LEMIS trade inventory, IUCN assessments, and a recent literature review, to characterise the global trade in amphibians, and also map use by purpose including meat, pets, medicinal and for research. We show that 1,215 species are being traded (17% of amphibian species), almost three times previous recorded numbers, 345 are threatened, and 100 data deficient or unassessed. Traded species origin hotspots include South American, China, and Central Africa; sources indicate 42% of amphibians are taken from the wild. Newly described species can be rapidly traded (mean time lag of 6.5 years), including threatened and unassessed species. The scale and limited regulation of the amphibian trade, paired with the triptych of connected pressures (collection, pathogens, invasive species), warrants a re-examination of the wildlife trade status-quo, application of the precautionary principle in regards to wildlife trade, and a renewed push to achieve global biodiversity goals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Loss of N1-methylation of G37 in tRNA induces ribosome stalling and reprograms gene expression</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i><sup>1</sup>-methylation of G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using <i>E. coli</i> as a model, we show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m<sup>1</sup>G37-containing tRNAs. Stalling occurs during decoding of affected codons at the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanism than that of +1 frameshifting, which occurs after the affected codons leave the A site. Enzyme- and cell-based assays show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces tRNA aminoacylation and in some cases peptide-bond formation. We observe changes of gene expression in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency similar to those in the stringent response that is typically induced by deficiency of amino acids. This work demonstrates a previously unrecognized function of m<sup>1</sup>G37 that emphasizes its role throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis, providing new insight into its essentiality for bacterial growth and survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A feedback loop between the androgen receptor and 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) drives prostate cancer growth</a></h4>

              
                Alterations to the androgen receptor (AR) signalling axis and cellular metabolism are hallmarks of prostate cancer. This study provides insight into both hallmarks by uncovering a novel link between AR and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Specifically, we identify 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (<i>6PGD</i>) as an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer. AR increased the expression of <i>6PGD </i>indirectly via activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Accordingly, loss of 6PGD, AR or SREBP1 resulted in suppression of PPP activity, as revealed by 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub> glucose metabolic flux analysis. Knockdown of 6PGD also impaired growth and elicited death of prostate cancer cells, at least in part due to increased oxidative stress. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 6PGD using two specific inhibitors, physcion and S3, and observed substantial anti-cancer activity in multiple models of prostate cancer, including aggressive, therapy-resistant models of castration-resistant disease as well as prospectively-collected patient-derived tumour explants. Targeting of 6PGD was associated with two important tumour-suppressive mechanisms: first, increased activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which repressed anabolic growth-promoting pathways regulated by ACC1 and mTOR; and second, enhanced AR ubiquitylation, associated with a reduction in AR protein levels and activity. Supporting the biological relevance of positive feedback between AR and PGD, pharmacological co-targeting of both factors was more effective in suppressing the growth of prostate cancer cells than single agent therapies. Collectively, this work provides new insight into the dysregulated metabolism of prostate cancer and provides impetus for further investigation of co-targeting AR and the PPP as a novel therapeutic strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cAMP effector PKA mediates Moody GPCR signaling in Drosophila blood-brain barrier formation and maturation</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of <i>Drosophila </i>is comprised of a thin epithelial layer of subperineural glia (SPG), which ensheath the nerve cord and insulate it against the potassium-rich hemolymph by forming intercellular septate junctions (SJs). Previously, we identified a novel Gi/Go protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Moody, as a key factor in BBB formation at the embryonic stage. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Moody signaling in BBB formation and maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) as a crucial antagonistic Moody effector that is required for the formation, as well as for the continued SPG growth and BBB maintenance in the larva and adult stage. We show that PKA is enriched at the basal side of the SPG cell and that this polarized activity of the Moody/PKA pathway finely tunes the enormous cell growth and BBB integrity. Moody/PKA signaling precisely regulates the actomyosin contractility, vesicle trafficking, and the proper SJ organization in a highly coordinated spatiotemporal manner. These effects are mediated in part by PKA's molecular targets MLCK and Rho1. Moreover, 3D reconstruction of SJ ultrastructure demonstrates that the continuity of individual SJ segments, and not their total length, is crucial for generating a proper paracellular seal. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized Moody/PKA signaling plays a central role in controlling the cell growth and maintaining BBB integrity during the continuous morphogenesis of the SPG secondary epithelium, which is critical to maintain tissue size and brain homeostasis during organogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sulfonylureas target the neurovascular response to decrease Alzheimer's pathology</a></h4>

              
                Hyperexcitability is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where aberrant neuronal activity is both a cause and consequence of AD. Therefore, identifying novel targets that modulate cellular excitability is an important strategy for treating AD. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are metabolic sensors that modulate cellular excitability. Sulfonylureas are KATP channel antagonists traditionally used to combat hyperglycemia in diabetic patients by inhibiting pancreatic KATP channels, thereby stimulating insulin release. However, KATP channels are not limited to the pancreas and systemic modulation of KATP channels has pleotropic physiological effects, including profound effects on vascular function. Here, we demonstrate that human AD patients have higher cortical expression of vascular KATP channels, important modulators of vasoreactivity. We demonstrate that peripheral treatment with the sulfonylurea and KATP channel inhibitor, glyburide, reduced the aggregation and activity-dependent production of amyloid-beta (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, in mice. Since glyburide does not readily cross the blood brain barrier, our data suggests that glyburide targets vascular KATP channel activity to reduce arterial stiffness, improve vasoreactivity, and normalize pericyte-endothelial cell morphology, offering a novel therapeutic target for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Iba1+ cell density and morphology classification at postnatal day 10 in four hippocampal subregions of female and male C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglia maintain normal brain function and support the brain's response to disease and injury. The hippocampus is an area of focus for microglial study due to its central role in numerous behavioral and cognitive functions. Interestingly, microglia and related cells in the hippocampus and throughout the brain are distinct in male vs. female rodents, even in early life. Indeed, postnatal day (P)-dependent sex differences in number, density, and morphology of microglia-like cells have been reported in certain hippocampal subregions. For example, P3 female mice have more phagocytic microglia in dentate gyrus (DG) molecular layer (Mol) and CA1-3 stratum oriens (SO) regions vs. male mice, while P8 -- but not P15 -- male rats have more volume immunoreactive for markers of microglia-like cells (Iba1 and CD68) in the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) vs. female rats. In the mouse, P10 is roughly equivalent to human term gestation, making it a common time point to study for many translationally-relevant neurobiological processes. However, sex differences in hippocampal microglia have not been examined in the P10 mouse hippocampus. In addition, key subregions of the hippocampus -- CA3 SR, DG hilus -- have not yet been assessed for sex differences in microglia. To address these knowledge gaps, we quantified Iba1+ cell densities and classified Iba1+ cell morphology in P10 male and female C57BL/6J mice. Four subregions in the bilateral anterior hippocampus were analyzed in 40-m coronal sections: DG Mol (Mol), DG Hilus, CA1 SR and stratum lacunosum moleculare (CA1), and CA3 SR and stratum lucidum (CA3). Light microscope images (40x) were analyzed offline for Iba1+ cell density and morphology by an observer blind to sex. The morphology of each Iba1+ cell was used to place cells into one of four previously-published categories: Round or ameboid (round-ish soma, no processes), Stout (round-ish soma, short process), Thick (irregular soma with few, thick processes), or Thin (irregular soma with multiple thin processes). Analysis of Iba1+ cell density shows no difference between male and female mice in Mol, Hilus, CA3, or CA1 (male n=6, female n=7). However, morphology classification shows a sex-dependent difference in the Mol and Hilus, with female mice having a greater percentage of Thick Iba1+ cells vs. male mice (Mol, Hilus), and a lower percentage of Thin Iba1+ cells vs. male mice (Mol). With our analysis, it is unclear whether this greater percentage of thick and lower percentage of thin Iba1+ cells in the female vs. male hippocampus means Iba1+ microglia in female mice are ''younger'' or ''more active'' than those in male mice. However, these data are important as they reveal sex differences in Iba1+ microglia in the P10 mouse hippocampus. We discuss these results in the context of the large literature on sex differences in rodent microglia in the early postnatal period.

                The subiculum is positioned at a critical juncture at the interface of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain. However, the exact roles of the subiculum in most hippocampal-dependent memory tasks remain largely unknown. One obstacle to make analytical comparisons of neural firing patterns between the subiculum and hippocampal CA1 is the broad firing fields of the subicular cells. Here, we used spiking phases in relation to theta rhythm to parse the broad firing field of a subicular neuron into multiple subfields to find the unique functional contribution of the subiculum while male rats performed a hippocampal-dependent visual scene memory task. Some of the broad firing fields of the subicular neurons were successfully divided into multiple subfields by using the theta-phase precession cycle. The resulting phase-based fields in the subiculum were more similar to those in CA1 in terms of the field size and phase-precession strength. The new method significantly improved the detection of task-relevant information in subicular cells without affecting the information content represented by CA1 cells. Notably, multiple fields of a single subicular neuron, unlike those in the CA1, could carry heterogeneous task-related information such as visual context and choice response. Our findings suggest that the subicular cells integrate multiple task-related factors by using theta rhythm to associate environmental context with action.

                Schizophrenia (Scz) is a brain disorder that has a typical onset in early adulthood but otherwise maintains unknown disease origins. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment of Scz due to ethical and technical limitations in accessing developing human brain tissue. To overcome this challenge, we have previously utilized patient-derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to generate self-developing, self-maturating, and self-organizing 3D brain-like tissue known as cerebral organoids. As a continuation of this prior work [1], here we provide a molecular architectural map of the developing Scz organoid proteome. Utilizing iPSCs from n = 25 human donors (n = 8 healthy Ctrl donors, and n = 17 Scz patients), we generated 3D human cerebral organoids, employed 16-plex isobaric sample-barcoding chemistry, and simultaneously subjected samples to comprehensive high-throughput liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) quantitative proteomics. Of 3,705 proteins identified by high-throughput proteomic profiling, we identified that just ~2.62% of the organoid global proteomic landscape was differentially regulated in Scz organoids. In sum, just 43 proteins were up-regulated and 54 were down-regulated in Scz patient-derived organoids. Notably, a range of neuronal factors were depleted in Scz organoids (e.g., MAP2, TUBB3, SV2A, GAP43, CRABP1, NCAM1 etc.). Based on global enrichment analysis, alterations in key pathways that regulate nervous system development (e.g., axonogenesis, axon development, axon guidance, morphogenesis pathways regulating neuronal differentiation, as well as substantia nigra development) were perturbed in Scz patient-derived organoids. We also identified prominent alterations in two novel GWAS factors, Pleiotrophin (PTN) and Podocalyxin (PODXL), in Scz organoids. In sum, this work serves as both a report and a resource whereby researchers can leverage human-derived neurodevelopmental data from Scz patients, which can be used to mine, compare, contrast, or orthogonally validate novel factors and pathways related to Scz risk identified in datasets from observational clinical studies and other model systems.

                Androgens regulate behavioural flexibility, which is essential to adapt to a changing environment and depends on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Testosterone (T) administration decreases behavioural flexibility. It is well known that T is produced in the gonads, but T is also produced in the mesocorticolimbic system, which modulates behavioural flexibility. It is unclear how T produced in the brain versus the gonads influences behavioural flexibility. Here, we assess the effects of the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate (ABI) and long-term gonadectomy (GDX) on behavioural flexibility in two paradigms. In Experiment 1, ABI independent of GDX reduced the number of trials to criterion and perseverative errors in a strategy set-shifting task. Similarly, in Experiment 2, ABI but not GDX reduced perseverative errors in a reversal learning task. In subjects from Experiment 1, we also examined tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir), and ABI but not GDX increased TH-ir in the mPFC. Our findings suggest that neurally-produced androgens modulate behavioural flexibility via modification of dopamine signalling in the mesocorticolimbic system. These results suggest novel roles for neurosteroids and possible side effects of ABI treatment for prostate cancer.

                Lack of physical activity is a predictor of poor health outcomes that can be prevented or reversed by exercise. Sedentary lifestyle, chronic disease or microgravity can cause muscle deconditioning that then has an impact on other physiological systems. An example is the nervous system, which is adversely affected by decreased physical activity resulting in increased incidence of neurological problems such as chronic pain. We sought to better understand how this might occur by conducting RNA sequencing experiments on muscle biopsies from human volunteers in a 5-week bed-rest study with an exercise intervention arm. We also used a computational method for examining ligand-receptor interactions between muscle and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the latter of which play a key role in nociception and are generators of signals responsible for chronic pain. We identified 1352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bed rest subjects without an exercise intervention but only 132 DEGs in subjects with the intervention. Thirty-six genes were shared between the exercise and no intervention groups. Among 591 upregulated muscle genes in the no intervention arm, 26 of these were ligands that have receptors that are expressed by human DRG neurons. We detected a specific splice variant of one of these ligands, placental growth factor (PGF), in deconditioned muscle that binds to neuropilin 1, a receptor that is highly expressed in DRG neurons and known to promote neuropathic pain. We conclude that exercise intervention protects muscle from deconditioning transcriptomic changes, and prevents changes in expression of ligands that might sensitize DRG neurons that promote pain. Our work creates a set of actionable hypotheses to better understand how deconditioned muscle may influence the function of sensory neurons that innervate the entire body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep learning based behavioral profiling of rodent stroke recovery</a></h4>

              
                Stroke research heavily relies on rodent behavior when assessing underlying disease mechanisms and treatment efficacy. Although functional motor recovery is considered the primary targeted outcome, tests in rodents are still poorly reproducible, and often unsuitable for unraveling the complex behavior after injury. Here, we provide a comprehensive 3D gait analysis of mice after focal cerebral ischemia based on the new deep learning-based software (DeepLabCut, DLC) that only requires basic behavioral equipment. We demonstrate a high precision 3D tracking of 10 body parts (including all relevant joints and reference landmarks) in several mouse strains with an accuracy of 99.4%. Building on this rigor motion tracking, a comprehensive post-analysis (with >100 parameters) unveils biologically relevant differences in locomotor profiles after a stroke over a time course of three weeks. We further refine the widely used ladder rung test using deep learning and compare its performance to human annotators. The generated DLC-assisted tests were then benchmarked to five widely used conventional behavioral set-ups (neurological scoring, rotarod, ladder rung walk, cylinder test, and single-pellet grasping) regarding sensitivity, accuracy, time use and costs. We conclude that deep learning-based motion tracking with comprehensive post-analysis provides accurate and sensitive data to describe the complex recovery of rodents following a stroke. The experimental set-up and analysis can also benefit a range of other neurological injuries that affect locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of Subpallial Neuronal Populations Across Zebrafish Larval Stages that Express Molecular Markers for the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                Striatal neurons within the basal ganglia play a central role in vertebrate action selection; however, their location in larval zebrafish is not well defined. We assayed for conserved striatal markers in the zebrafish subpallium using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. Whole mount FISH revealed an inhibitory neuronal cluster rostral to the anterior commissure that expresses tac1, the gene that encodes the precursor peptide for substance P. This molecular profile is shared by mammalian striatal direct pathway neurons. A second partially overlapping population of inhibitory neurons was identified that expresses penka, the gene that encodes the precursor peptide for enkephalin. This molecular profile is shared by striatal indirect pathway neurons. Immunostaining for substance P and enkephalin confirmed the presence of these peptides in the subpallium as well as the presence of dopaminergic innervation. The tac1 and penka populations were both found to increase linearly across larval stages. Together, these findings support the existence of a striatal homologue in larval zebrafish that grows to match the development and increasing behavioural complexity of the organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A gap-junction mutation in the mouse cochlea reveals cochlear amplification is driven by outer hair cell extracellular receptor potentials</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear amplification, whereby cochlear responses to low-to-moderate sound levels are 31 amplified and compressed to loud sounds, is attributed to outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility 32 driven by voltage changes across the OHC basolateral membranes due to sound-induced 33 receptor-current modulation. Cochlear operation at high acoustic frequencies is enigmatic 34 because the OHC intracellular receptor potential (RP) is severely attenuated at these 35 frequencies. Clues to understanding the voltage control of OHC electromotility at different 36 frequencies was provided by measurements from CD-1 mice with an A88V mutation of the 37 gap-junction (GJ) protein connexin 30 (Cx30), which with Cx26, form heterogeneous GJs 38 between supporting cells in the organ of Corti (OoC) and stria vascularis. The A88V mutation 39 results in a smaller GJ conductance which may explain why the resistance across the OoC in 40 CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mutants is higher compared with wild-type mice. The endocochlear 41 potential, which drives the OHC receptor current and, consequently, the OHC RPs, is smaller 42 in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mutants. Even so, their high-frequency hearing sensitivity equals that of 43 wild-type mice. Preservation of high-frequency hearing correlates with similar amplitude of 44 extracellular receptor potentials (ERPs), measured immediately adjacent to the OHCs. ERPs 45 are generated through OHC receptor current flow across the OoC electrical resistance, which 46 is larger in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V than in wild-type mice. Thus, smaller OHC receptor currents 47 flowing across a larger OoC resistance in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mice may explain why their ERP 48 magnitudes are similar to wild-type mice. It is proposed that the ERPs, which are not subject 49 to low-pass electrical filtering, drive high-frequency cochlear amplification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms of Coupling between Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus encapsulated by a spike (S) glycoprotein envelope, binds with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) during cell entry of a susceptible host. Recent studies suggest nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a role in functional ACE2 regulation and nicotine may contribute to the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we present evidence for coupling between ACE2 and nAChR through bioinformatic analysis and cell culture experiments. Following molecular and structural protein comparison of over 250 ACE2 vertebrate orthologues, a region of human ACE2 at positions C542-L554 was identified to have sequence similarity to nAChR-binding neurotoxin and rabies virus glycoproteins (RBVG). Furthermore, experiments conducted in PC12 cells indicate a potential for physical interaction between ACE2 and alpha 7 nAChR proteins. Our findings support a model of nAChR involvement in in COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral sTREM2-related inflammatory activity alterations in early stage Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to multiple immune system genetic variants, implicating potential broad alterations in inflammatory profiles in the disease. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) genetic variants are risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A soluble TREM2 isoform (sTREM2) is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in the early stages of AD suggesting it may be a biomarker of progressive alterations in immune response to AD-related pathology. Multiple studies have reported an altered peripheral immune response in AD. However, less is known about the relationship between plasma sTREM2 and the altered peripheral immune response in AD. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory activity in human participants defined by clinically characterized cognitive symptoms and groups defined by the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, and neurodegeneration (NIA-AA Research Framework: "ATN continuum".) The hypothesis of this exploratory study was that sTREM2 related inflammatory activity differs by AD stage. We observed different patterns of inflammatory activity across disease groups and ATN categories that implicates peripheral sTREM2 related inflammatory activity as altered in the early stages of AD. Notably, fractalkine showed a significant relationship with sTREM2 across different analyses in the control groups that was lost as disease progressed, and fractalkine, IL-5 and IL-17A were decreased in AD. These preliminary data provide important support to the hypothesis that sTREM2-related inflammatory activity is a stage-specific biomarker of AD progression, providing the groundwork for future studies and therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence for three functionally specialized subregions in the subthalamic nucleus: A model-based 7 T fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small, subcortical brain structure. It is a target for deep brain stimulation, an invasive treatment that reduces motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Side effects of DBS are commonly explained using the tripartite model of STN organization, which proposes three functionally distinct subregions in the STN specialized in cognitive, limbic, and motor processing. However, evidence for the tripartite model exclusively comes from anatomical studies and functional studies using clinical patients. Here, we provide the first experimental tests of the tripartite model in healthy volunteers using ultra-high field 7 Tesla (T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 34 participants performed a random-dot motion decision-making task with a difficulty manipulation and a choice payoff manipulation aimed to differentially affect cognitive and limbic networks. Moreover, participants responded with their left and right index finger, differentially affecting motor networks. We analysed BOLD signal in three subregions of equal volume of the STN along the dorsolateral-ventromedial axis, identified using manually delineated high resolution anatomical images. Our results indicate that all segments responded equally to the experimental manipulations, and did not support the tripartite model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Invalidity of light sensor data in field studies and a proposal of an algorithmic approach for detection and filtering of non-wear time</a></h4>

              
                Wearable light sensors are increasingly used in intervention and population-based studies investigating the consequences of environmental light exposure on human physiology. An important step in such analyses is the reliable detection of non-wear time. We observed in light data that days with less wear-time also have lower variability in the light signal, and we sought to test if the standard deviation of the change between subsequent samples can detect this condition. In this study, we propose and validate an easy-to-implement algorithm designed to discriminate between days with a non-wear time >4h ('invalid days') vs. [&le;]4h ('valid days') and investigate to which extent values of commonly used physiologically meaningful light variables differ between invalid days, valid days, and algorithm-selected non-wear days. We used 83 days of light data from a field study with high participant compliance, complemented by 47 days of light data where free-living individuals were instructed not to wear the sensor for varying amounts of time. Light data were recorded every two minutes using the pendant-worn f.luxometer light sensor; validity was derived from daily logs where participants recorded all non wear time. The algorithm-derived score discriminated well between valid and invalid days (area under the curve (AUC): 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). The best cut-off value (i.e., highest Youden index) correctly recognized valid days with a probability of 87% ('sensitivity'), and invalid days with a probability of 63% ('specificity'). Values of various light variables derived from algorithm selected days only (median: 264.3 (Q1: 153.6, Q3: 420.0) for 24h light intensity (in lux); 496.0 (404.0, 582.0) for time spent above 50-lux) gave values close to those derived from self reported valid days only. However, these values did not significantly differ when derived across all days compared to self-reported valid days. Our results suggest that our proposed algorithm discriminates well between valid and invalid days. However, in high compliance cohorts, distortions in aggregated light measures of individual-level environmental light recordings across days appear to be small, making the application of our algorithm optional, but not necessary.

	<p>In youths, callous–unemotional (CU) traits and conduct problems (CP) are independently associated with bullying perpetration and these effects are also observed when controlling for sex. Moreover, research indicates that the co-existence of high levels of both CU and CP further increase the risk. Although several studies have examined the relationship between CU traits and traditional bullying, few have also included a measure of cyberbullying and very few of them have focused the early adolescence. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend these findings in a large sample of Italian early adolescents considering both traditional and cyberbullying behaviors. Data were extracted from the Bullying and Youth Mental Health Naples study (BYMHNS) which included 2959 students of 10–15 years of age. CP, CU traits, traditional bullying behaviors, and cyberbullying behaviors were assessed by multi-item self-report scales. As expected, we replicated the significant and specific association between CU traits and traditional bullying, extending the findings to cyberbullying. In addition, in the latter case the effect was moderated by CP. The theoretical and clinical implications of these results were discussed.</p>

	<p>Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading neurological cause of disability in young adults. As a chronic disease, MS requires complex and challenging management. In this context, eHealth has gained an increasing relevance. Here, we aim to summarize beneficial features of a mobile app recently implemented in clinical MS routine as well as beyond MS. PatientConcept is a CE-certified, ID-associated multilingual software application allowing patients to record relevant health data without disclosing any identifying data. Patients can voluntarily share their health data with selected physicians. Since its implementation in 2018, about 3000 MS patients have used PatientConcept. Initially developed as a physician–patient communication platform, the app maps risk management plans of all current disease modifying therapies and thereby facilitates adherence to specified monitoring appointments. It also allows continuous monitoring of various PROs (Patient Reported Outcomes), enabling a broad overview of the disease course. In addition, various studies/projects currently assess monitoring, follow-up, diagnostics and telemetric evaluations of patients with other diseases beyond MS. Altogether, PatientConcept offers a broad range of possibilities to support physician–patient communication, implementation of risk management plans and assessment of PROs. It is a promising tool to facilitate patient-tailored management of MS and other chronic diseases.</p>

	<p>Impaired verbal ‘phonological’ short-term memory is considered a cardinal feature of the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) and is assumed to underpin most of the language deficits in this syndrome. Clinically, examination of verbal short-term memory in individuals presenting with PPA is common practice and serves two objectives: (i) to help understand the possible mechanisms underlying the patient’s language profile and (ii) to help differentiate lv-PPA from other PPA variants or from other dementia syndromes. Distinction between lv-PPA and the non-fluent variant of PPA (nfv-PPA), however, can be especially challenging due to overlapping language profiles and comparable psychometric performances on verbal short-term memory tests. Here, we present case vignettes of the three PPA variants (lv-PPA, nfv-PPA, and the semantic variant (sv-PPA)) and typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These vignettes provide a detailed description of the short-term and working memory profiles typically found in these patients and highlight how speech output and language comprehension deficits across the PPA variants differentially interfere with verbal memory performance. We demonstrate that a combination of verbal short-term and working memory measures provides crucial information regarding the cognitive mechanisms underlying language disturbances in PPA. In addition, we propose that analogous visuospatial span tasks are essential for the assessment of PPA as they measure memory capacity without language contamination.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ in situ hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that it may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

                <p>Poststroke optogenetic stimulations can promote functional recovery. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying recovery remain unclear. Elucidating key neural circuits involved in recovery will be invaluable for translating neuromodulation strategies after stroke. Here, we used optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain-wide neural circuit dynamics after stroke in mice treated with and without optogenetic excitatory neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1). We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth&ndash;associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin<sup>+</sup>/channelrhodopsin<sup>+</sup> presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery. Together, these findings suggest early involvement of corticothalamic circuit as an important mediator of poststroke recovery.</p>

Many phases that are believed to exhibit exotic properties only exist on the nanoscale, coexisting with other phases that make them challenging to study, as measurements require both nanometer spatial resolution and spectroscopic information, which are not easily accessible with traditional x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques. Here, we use coherent diffractive imaging spectroscopy (CDIS) to acquire quantitative hyperspectral images of the prototypical quantum material vanadium oxide across the vanadium <I>L</I><SUB>2,3</SUB> and oxygen <I>K</I> x-ray absorption edges with nanometer-scale resolution. We extract the full complex refractive indices of the monoclinic insulating and rutile conducting phases of VO<SUB>2</SUB> from a single sample and find no evidence for correlation-driven phase transitions. CDIS will enable quantitative full-field x-ray spectromicroscopy for studying phase separation in time-resolved experiments and other extreme sample environments where other methods cannot operate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Single-molecule measurements reveal that PARP1 condenses DNA by loop stabilization</a></h4>

              
                <p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that plays important roles in DNA repair, chromatin organization and transcription regulation. Although binding and activation of PARP1 by DNA damage sites has been extensively studied, little is known about how PARP1 binds to long stretches of undamaged DNA and how it could shape chromatin architecture. Here, using single-molecule techniques, we show that PARP1 binds and condenses undamaged, kilobase-length DNA subject to sub-piconewton mechanical forces. Stepwise decondensation at high force and DNA braiding experiments show that the condensation activity is due to the stabilization of DNA loops by PARP1. PARP inhibitors do not affect the level of condensation of undamaged DNA but act to block condensation reversal for damaged DNA in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Our findings suggest a mechanism for PARP1 in the organization of chromatin structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Efficient derivation of human trophoblast stem cells from primed pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) provide a valuable model to study placental development and function. While primary hTSCs have been derived from embryos/early placenta, and transdifferentiated hTSCs from nai&#x0308;ve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), the generation of hTSCs from primed PSCs is problematic. We report the successful generation of TSCs from primed hPSCs and show that BMP4 substantially enhances this process. TSCs derived from primed hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs in terms of morphology, proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression. We define the chromatin accessibility dynamics and histone modifications (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) that specify hPSC-derived TSCs. Consistent with low density of H3K27me3 in primed hPSC-derived hTSCs, we show that knockout of H3K27 methyltransferases (EZH1/2) increases the efficiency of hTSC derivation from primed hPSCs. Efficient derivation of hTSCs from primed hPSCs provides a simple and powerful model to understand human trophoblast development, including the pathogenesis of trophoblast-related disorders, by generating disease-specific hTSCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A general model for the demographic signatures of the transition from pandemic emergence to endemicity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anticipating the medium- and long-term trajectory of pathogen emergence has acquired new urgency given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For many human pathogens, the burden of disease depends on age and previous exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing, and immunity to establish a plausible range for future age incidence and mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism across a range of immunity durations and relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured mixing to bound expectations for changing age incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailor mitigation strategies in countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Room temperature crack-healing in an atomically layered ternary carbide</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ceramic materials provide outstanding chemical and structural stability at high temperatures and in hostile environments but are susceptible to catastrophic fracture that severely limits their applicability. Traditional approaches to partially overcome this limitation rely on activating toughening mechanisms during crack growth to postpone fracture. Here, we demonstrate a more potent toughening mechanism that involves an intriguing possibility of healing the cracks as they form, even at room temperature, in an atomically layered ternary carbide. Crystals of this class of ceramic materials readily fracture along weakly bonded crystallographic planes. However, the onset of an abstruse mode of deformation, referred to as kinking in these materials, induces large crystallographic rotations and plastic deformation that physically heal the cracks. This implies that the toughness of numerous other layered ceramic materials, whose broader applications have been limited by their susceptibility to catastrophic fracture, can also be enhanced by microstructural engineering to promote kinking and crack-healing.</p>

                <p>Stochastic resonance, where noise synchronizes a system&rsquo;s response to an external drive, is a wide-reaching phenomenon found in noisy systems spanning from the dynamics of neurons to the periodicity of ice ages. Quantum tunneling can extend stochastic resonance to the quantum realm. We demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance for magnetic transitions in atoms by inelastic electron tunneling with a scanning tunneling microscope. Stochastic resonance is shown deep in the quantum regime, where spin-state fluctuations are driven by tunneling of the magnetization, and in a semiclassical crossover region, where thermally excited electrons drive transitions between ground and excited states. Inducing synchronization by periodically modulating transition rates provides a general mechanism to determine real-time spin dynamics ranging from milliseconds to picoseconds.</p>

Here, we tested the mental mappings of the Tsimane&rsquo;, an indigenous population with few such cultural practices. Tsimane&rsquo; adults spatially arranged number, size, and time stimuli according to their relative magnitudes but showed no directional bias for any domain on any spatial axis; different mappings went in different directions, even in the same participant. These findings challenge claims that people have an innate left-to-right mapping of numbers and that these mappings arise from a domain-general magnitude system. Rather, the direction-specific mappings found in industrialized cultures may originate from direction-agnostic mappings that reflect the correlational structure of the natural world.</p>

                <p>Orbital angular momentum of light is a core feature in photonics. Its confinement to surfaces using plasmonics has unlocked many phenomena and potential applications. Here, we introduce the reflection from structural boundaries as a new degree of freedom to generate and control plasmonic orbital angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrate plasmonic vortex cavities, generating a succession of vortex pulses with increasing topological charge as a function of time. We track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these angularly decelerating plasmon pulse train within the cavities for over 300 femtoseconds using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, showing that the angular momentum grows by multiples of the chiral order of the cavity. The introduction of this degree of freedom to tame orbital angular momentum delivered by plasmonic vortices could miniaturize pump probe&ndash;like quantum initialization schemes, increase the torque exerted by plasmonic tweezers, and potentially achieve vortex lattice cavities with dynamically evolving topology.</p>

                <p>The ability to characterize individual biomarker protein molecules in patient blood samples could enable diagnosis of diseases at an earlier stage, when treatment is typically more effective. Single-molecule imaging offers a promising approach to accomplish this goal. However, thus far, single-molecule imaging methods have not been translated into the clinical setting. The detection limit of these methods has been confined to the picomolar (10<sup>&ndash;12</sup> M) range, several orders of magnitude higher than the circulating concentrations of biomarker proteins present in many diseases. Here, we describe single-molecule augmented capture (SMAC), a single-molecule imaging technique to quantify and characterize individual protein molecules of interest down to the subfemtomolar (&lt;10<sup>&ndash;15</sup> M) range. We demonstrate SMAC in a variety of applications with human blood samples, including the analysis of disease-associated secreted proteins, membrane proteins, and rare intracellular proteins. SMAC opens the door to the application of single-molecule imaging in noninvasive disease profiling.</p>

                <p>The history of Earth&rsquo;s climate and carbon cycle is preserved in deep-sea foraminiferal carbon and oxygen isotope records. Here, we show that the sub-million-year fluctuations in both records have exhibited negatively skewed non-Gaussian tails throughout much of the Cenozoic era (66 Ma to present), suggesting an intrinsic asymmetry that favors "hyperthermal-like" extreme events of abrupt global warming and oxidation of organic carbon. We show that this asymmetry is quantitatively consistent with a general mechanism of self-amplification that can be modeled using stochastic multiplicative noise. A numerical climate&ndash;carbon cycle model in which the amplitude of random biogeochemical fluctuations increases at higher temperatures reproduces the data well and can further explain the apparent pacing of past extreme warming events by changes in orbital parameters. Our results also suggest that, as anthropogenic warming continues, Earth&rsquo;s climate may become more susceptible to extreme warming events on time scales of tens of thousands of years.</p>

                <p>Cyclically sheared jammed packings form memories of the shear amplitude at which they were trained by falling into periodic orbits where each particle returns to the identical position in subsequent cycles. While simple models that treat clusters of rearranging particles as isolated two-state systems offer insight into this memory formation, they fail to account for the long training times and multiperiod orbits observed in simulated sheared packings. We show that adding interactions between rearranging clusters overcomes these deficiencies. In addition, interactions allow simultaneous encoding of multiple memories, which would not have been possible otherwise. These memories are different in an essential way from those found in other systems, such as multiple transient memories observed in sheared suspensions, and contain information about the strength of the interactions.</p>

                <p>When an amorphous solid is deformed cyclically, it may reach a steady state in which the paths of constituent particles trace out closed loops that repeat in each driving cycle. A remarkable variant has been noticed in simulations where the period of particle motions is a multiple of the period of driving, but the reasons for this behavior have remained unclear. Motivated by mesoscopic features of displacement fields in experiments on jammed solids, we propose and analyze a simple model of interacting soft spots&mdash;locations where particles rearrange under stress and that resemble two-level systems with hysteresis. We show that multiperiodic behavior can arise among just three or more soft spots that interact with each other, but in all cases it requires frustrated interactions, illuminating this otherwise elusive type of interaction. We suggest directions for seeking this signature of frustration in experiments and for achieving it in designed systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Stochastic gene expression drives mesophyll protoplast regeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cell pluripotency is fundamental to biology. It has long been known that differentiated somatic plant cells may reacquire pluripotency, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A PSMA-targeted bispecific antibody for prostate cancer driven by a small-molecule targeting ligand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the development of next-generation antiandrogens, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable. Here, we describe a unique semisynthetic bispecific antibody that uses site-specific unnatural amino acid conjugation to combine the potency of a T cell&ndash;recruiting anti-CD3 antibody with the specificity of an imaging ligand (DUPA) for prostate-specific membrane antigen. This format enabled optimization of structure and function to produce a candidate (CCW702) with specific, potent in vitro cytotoxicity and improved stability compared with a bispecific single-chain variable fragment format. In vivo, CCW702 eliminated C4-2 xenografts with as few as three weekly subcutaneous doses and prevented growth of PCSD1 patient-derived xenograft tumors in mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, CCW702 was well tolerated up to 34.1 mg/kg per dose, with near-complete subcutaneous bioavailability and a PK profile supporting testing of a weekly dosing regimen in patients. CCW702 is being evaluated in a first in-human clinical trial for men with mCRPC who had progressed on prior therapies (NCT04077021).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Sex and Estrous Cycle on the Time Course of Incubation of Cue-Induced Craving following Extended-Access Cocaine Self-Administration</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cocaine addiction is a devastating public health epidemic that continues to grow. Studies focused on identifying biological factors influencing cocaine craving and relapse vulnerability are necessary to promote abstinence in recovering drug users. Sex and ovarian hormones are known to influence cocaine addiction liability and relapse vulnerability in both humans and rodents. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in the time-dependent intensification or "incubation" of cue-induced cocaine craving that occurs during withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration and have identified changes across the rat reproductive cycle (estrous cycle). Female rats in the estrus stage of the cycle (Estrus Females), the phase during which ovulation occurs, show an increase in the magnitude of incubated cue-induced cocaine craving compared with females in all other phases of the estrous cycle (Non-Estrus Females). Here we extend these findings by assessing incubated craving across the estrous cycle during earlier withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 1 and 15) and later withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 48). We found that this increase in the magnitude of incubated craving during estrus (Estrus Females) is present on withdrawal day 15, but not on withdrawal day 1, and further increases by withdrawal day 48. No difference in the magnitude of incubated craving was observed between Males and Non-Estrus Females. Our data indicate that the effects of hormonal fluctuations on cue-induced cocaine craving intensify during the first month and a half of withdrawal, showing an interaction among abstinence length, estrous cycle fluctuations, and cocaine craving.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">MicroRNAs 21 and 199a-3p Regulate Axon Growth Potential through Modulation of Pten and mTor mRNAs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Increased mTOR activity has been shown to enhance regeneration of injured axons by increasing neuronal protein synthesis, while PTEN signaling can block mTOR activity to attenuate protein synthesis. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in regulation of PTEN and mTOR expression, and previous work in spinal cord showed an increase in miR-199a-3p after spinal cord injury (SCI) and increase in miR-21 in SCI animals that had undergone exercise. Pten mRNA is a target for miR-21 and miR-199a-3p is predicted to target mTor mRNA. Here, we show that miR-21 and miR-199a-3p are expressed in adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we used culture preparations to test functions of the rat miRs in adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons. miR-21 increases and miR-199a-3p decreases in DRG neurons after in vivo axotomy. In both the adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons, miR-21 promotes and miR-199a-3p attenuates neurite growth. miR-21 directly bound to Pten mRNA and miR-21 overexpression decreased Pten mRNA levels. Conversely, miR-199a-3p directly bound to mTor mRNA and miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased mTor mRNA levels. Overexpressing miR-21 increased both overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis in cultured DRGs, while miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased this protein synthesis. The axon growth phenotypes seen with miR-21 and miR-199a-3p overexpression were reversed by co-transfecting PTEN and mTOR cDNA expression constructs with the predicted 3' untranslated region (UTR) miR target sequences deleted. Taken together, these studies indicate that injury-induced alterations in miR-21 and miR-199a-3p expression can alter axon growth capacity by changing overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis through regulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Nicotine is an addictive substance historically consumed through smoking and more recently through the use of electronic vapor devices. The increasing prevalence and popularity of vaping prompts the need for preclinical rodent models of nicotine vapor exposure and an improved understanding of the impact of vaping on specific brain regions, bodily functions, and behaviors. We used a rodent model of electronic nicotine vapor exposure to examine the cellular and behavioral consequences of acute and repeated vapor exposure. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a single 3-h session (acute exposure) or five daily sessions (repeated exposure) of intermittent vapes of 120 mg/ml nicotine in propylene glycol:vegetable glycerol (PG/VG) or PG/VG control. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure did not alter body weight, and both exposure paradigms produced pharmacologically significant serum nicotine and cotinine levels in the 120 mg/ml nicotine group compared with PG/VG controls. Acute exposure to electronic nicotine vapor increased central amygdala (CeA) activity in individual neuronal firing and in expression of the molecular activity marker, cFos. The changes in neuronal activity following acute exposure were not observed following repeated exposure. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure decreased core body temperature, however acute exposure decreased locomotion while repeated exposure increased locomotion. Collectively, these studies provide validation of a mouse model of nicotine vapor exposure and important evidence for how exposure to electronic nicotine vapor produces differential effects on CeA neuronal activity and on specific body functions and behaviors like thermoregulation and locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Implicit Visuomotor Adaptation Remains Limited after Several Days of Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks has been viewed as an implicit learning phenomenon. The implicit process affords recalibration of existing motor skills so that the system can adjust to changes in the body or environment without relearning from scratch. However, recent findings suggest that the implicit process is heavily constrained, calling into question its utility in motor learning and the theoretical framework of sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. These inferences have been based mainly on results from single bouts of training, where explicit compensation strategies, such as explicitly re-aiming the intended movement direction, contribute a significant proportion of adaptive learning. It is possible, however, that the implicit process supersedes explicit compensation strategies over repeated practice sessions. We tested this by dissociating the contributions of explicit re-aiming strategies and the implicit process in human participants over five consecutive days of training. Despite a substantially longer duration of training, the implicit process still plateaued at a value far short of complete learning and, as has been observed in previous studies, was inappropriate for a mirror-reversal task. Notably, we find significant between subject differences that call into question traditional interpretation of these group-level results.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations in the X-linked cell adhesion protein PCDH19 lead to seizures, cognitive impairment, and other behavioral comorbidities when present in a mosaic pattern. Neither the molecular mechanisms underpinning this disorder nor the function of PCDH19 itself are well understood. By combining RNA <I>in situ</I> hybridization with immunohistochemistry and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we reveal <I>Pcdh19</I> expression in cortical interneurons and provide a first account of the subtypes of neurons expressing <I>Pcdh19</I>/<I>PCDH19</I>, both in the mouse and the human cortex. Our quantitative analysis of the <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mouse exposes subtle changes in cortical layer composition, with no major alterations of the main axonal tracts. In addition, <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant animals, particularly females, display preweaning behavioral changes, including reduced anxiety and increased exploratory behavior. Importantly, our experiments also reveal an effect of the social environment on the behavior of wild-type littermates of <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mice, which show alterations when compared with wild-type animals not housed with mutants.</p>
