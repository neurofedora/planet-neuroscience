              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unmasking the cloak of comorbidities in OSA-association and their severity – a prospective observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with high prevalence in the community but highly underreported. It is also seen that a significant number of cases with OSA are associated with various comorbidities. The study objective was to estimate and assess the specific type and proportion of various comorbidities seen in association with OSA and association of severity of OSA with comorbidities. Methods: The study was a hospital-based descriptive study of 85 patients with OSA. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data and Chi-square test was done to find out the association. Results: The most common comorbidity associated with OSA was obesity (60%). Around half of the patients (49.4%) had severe OSA based on Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) scores. Statistically significant association was seen between presence of comorbidities, like diabetes and hypertension, and risk of OSA based on the snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, blood pressure (S.T.O.P) questionnaire. Conclusions: In our study, a significant proportion (73%) of patients with OSA had associated   comorbidities at the time of initial diagnosis. This indicates a delayed diagnosis as OSA is diagnosed only after multiple and irreversible comorbidities have developed. A majority (49%) had a severe OSA on initial presentation. This combination of multiple comorbidities and severe OSA at the time on diagnosis is reflective of a huge problem that is peculiar to OSA at large at a community level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous among Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mental foramen (MF) and its accessories are the important anatomical considerations while placing implants or doing surgical procedures in and around the mandibular premolar region. This study aimed to evaluate the shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous patients among the Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans that were taken between 2015 and 2020 from Riyadh Elm University were retrieved. A total of 180 samples of CBCT (90 dentate and 90 edentulous) were analyzed. Prevalence of different horizontal positions of the mental foramen (P1 to P6) and other additive parameters like the distance from mental foramen to alveolar crest and inferior border of the mandible, along with the mental foramen angle was assessed. The difference in the mental foramen location among dentate and edentulous subjects was assessed. Gender and age variation also was assessed. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Results: The predominant horizontal position is P4 followed by P3 (59 % in males and 63 % in females at P4, and 15 % each in males and females at P3, respectively). The horizontal position of the mental foramen and gender showed a statistical significance difference, especially at the P3B, P5, and P4 positions. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was seen in the mental foramen to the mandibular inferior border of the mandible (MF_MSB) and the width of mental foramen in the transverse section (MFW). Comparison of the mental foramen among dentate and edentulous subjects showed a statistically significant difference. There was a change in the mental foramen with age. Conclusions: Based on the methodology and sample of this study, it can be concluded that the edentulism only reduced the dimension of the mental foramen opening.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The impact of sparsity in low-rank recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elizabeth Herbert, Srdjan Ostojic</p>

Neural population dynamics are often highly coordinated, allowing task-related computations to be understood as neural trajectories through low-dimensional subspaces. How the network connectivity and input structure give rise to such activity can be investigated with the aid of low-rank recurrent neural networks, a recently-developed class of computational models which offer a rich theoretical framework linking the underlying connectivity structure to emergent low-dimensional dynamics. This framework has so far relied on the assumption of all-to-all connectivity, yet cortical networks are known to be highly sparse. Here we investigate the dynamics of low-rank recurrent networks in which the connections are randomly sparsified, which makes the network connectivity formally full-rank. We first analyse the impact of sparsity on the eigenvalue spectrum of low-rank connectivity matrices, and use this to examine the implications for the dynamics. We find that in the presence of sparsity, the eigenspectra in the complex plane consist of a continuous bulk and isolated outliers, a form analogous to the eigenspectra of connectivity matrices composed of a low-rank and a full-rank random component. This analogy allows us to characterise distinct dynamical regimes of the sparsified low-rank network as a function of key network parameters. Altogether, we find that the low-dimensional dynamics induced by low-rank connectivity structure are preserved even at high levels of sparsity, and can therefore support rich and robust computations even in networks sparsified to a biologically-realistic extent.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Genome-wide association studies of global Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to 13 antimicrobials in 10,228 genomes identify new resistance mechanisms</a></h4>

The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major global public health concern that threatens the ability to control the disease. Whole-genome sequencing as a tool to rapidly diagnose resistant infections can transform patient treatment and clinical practice. While resistance mechanisms are well understood for some drugs, there are likely many mechanisms yet to be uncovered, particularly for new and repurposed drugs. We sequenced 10,228 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) isolates worldwide and determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on a grid of 2-fold concentration dilutions for 13 antimicrobials using quantitative microtiter plate assays. We performed oligopeptide- and oligonucleotide-based genome-wide association studies using linear mixed models to discover resistance-conferring mechanisms not currently catalogued. Use of MIC over binary resistance phenotypes increased sample heritability for the new and repurposed drugs by 26% to 37%, increasing our ability to detect novel associations. For all drugs, we discovered uncatalogued variants associated with MIC, including in the <i>Rv1218c</i> promoter binding site of the transcriptional repressor <i>Rv1219c</i> (isoniazid), upstream of the <i>vapBC20</i> operon that cleaves 23S rRNA (linezolid) and in the region encoding an α-helix lining the active site of Cyp142 (clofazimine, all <i>p</i> < 10<sup>−7.7</sup>). We observed that artefactual signals of cross-resistance could be unravelled based on the relative effect size on MIC. Our study demonstrates the ability of very large-scale studies to substantially improve our knowledge of genetic variants associated with antimicrobial resistance in <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human perceptual and metacognitive decision-making rely on distinct brain networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paolo Di Luzio, Luca Tarasi, Juha Silvanto, Alessio Avenanti, Vincenzo Romei</p>

Perceptual decisions depend on the ability to exploit available sensory information in order to select the most adaptive option from a set of alternatives. Such decisions depend on the perceptual sensitivity of the organism, which is generally accompanied by a corresponding level of certainty about the choice made. Here, by use of corticocortical paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol (ccPAS) aimed at inducing plastic changes, we shaped perceptual sensitivity and metacognitive ability in a motion discrimination task depending on the targeted network, demonstrating their functional dissociation. Neurostimulation aimed at boosting V5/MT+-to-V1/V2 back-projections enhanced motion sensitivity without impacting metacognition, whereas boosting IPS/LIP-to-V1/V2 back-projections increased metacognitive efficiency without impacting motion sensitivity. This double-dissociation provides causal evidence of distinct networks for perceptual sensitivity and metacognitive ability in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multivariate phenotype analysis enables genome-wide inference of mammalian gene function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Nicholson, Hugh Morgan, Habib Ganjgahi, Steve D. M. Brown, Ann-Marie Mallon, Chris Holmes</p>

The function of the majority of genes in the human and mouse genomes is unknown. Investigating and illuminating this dark genome is a major challenge for the biomedical sciences. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) is addressing this through the generation and broad-based phenotyping of a knockout (KO) mouse line for every protein-coding gene, producing a multidimensional data set that underlies a genome-wide annotation map from genes to phenotypes. Here, we develop a multivariate (MV) statistical approach and apply it to IMPC data comprising 148 phenotypes measured across 4,548 KO lines.
There are 4,256 (1.4% of 302,997 observed data measurements) hits called by the univariate (UV) model analysing each phenotype separately, compared to 31,843 (10.5%) hits in the observed data results of the MV model, corresponding to an estimated 7.5-fold increase in power of the MV model relative to the UV model. One key property of the data set is its 55.0% rate of missingness, resulting from quality control filters and incomplete measurement of some KO lines. This raises the question of whether it is possible to infer perturbations at phenotype–gene pairs at which data are not available, i.e., to infer some in vivo effects using statistical analysis rather than experimentation. We demonstrate that, even at missing phenotypes, the MV model can detect perturbations with power comparable to the single-phenotype analysis, thereby filling in the complete gene–phenotype map with good sensitivity.
A factor analysis of the MV model’s fitted covariance structure identifies 20 clusters of phenotypes, with each cluster tending to be perturbed collectively. These factors cumulatively explain 75% of the KO-induced variation in the data and facilitate biological interpretation of perturbations. We also demonstrate that the MV approach strengthens the correspondence between IMPC phenotypes and existing gene annotation databases. Analysis of a subset of KO lines measured in replicate across multiple laboratories confirms that the MV model increases power with high replicability.

The Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis: an International Consortium (CRyPTIC) presents here a data compendium of 12,289 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> global clinical isolates, all of which have undergone whole-genome sequencing and have had their minimum inhibitory concentrations to 13 antitubercular drugs measured in a single assay. It is the largest matched phenotypic and genotypic dataset for <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> to date. Here, we provide a summary detailing the breadth of data collected, along with a description of how the isolates were selected, collected, and uniformly processed in CRyPTIC partner laboratories across 23 countries. The compendium contains 6,814 isolates resistant to at least 1 drug, including 2,129 samples that fully satisfy the clinical definitions of rifampicin resistant (RR), multidrug resistant (MDR), pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR), or extensively drug resistant (XDR). The data are enriched for rare resistance-associated variants, and the current limits of genotypic prediction of resistance status (sensitive/resistant) are presented by using a genetic mutation catalogue, along with the presence of suspected resistance-conferring mutations for isolates resistant to the newly introduced drugs bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, and linezolid. Finally, a case study of rifampicin monoresistance demonstrates how this compendium could be used to advance our genetic understanding of rare resistance phenotypes. The data compendium is fully open source and it is hoped that it will facilitate and inspire future research for years to come.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of personality traits and engagement factors towards the use of paid stickers in personal communication messages [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The research investigated the personality traits and engagement factors that influence the use of paid stickers in personal communication. The study was driven by the increasing significance of stickers such as emoticons and emojis in online dialogues. The study was hinged on the Theory of the big five personality traits; neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The study tested seven hypotheses to ascertain the effect of personality traits and engagement factors towards the utilization of paid stickers in personal communication. Methods: The research applied the quantitative survey research design, where primary data was collected from respondents that had experience in using emojis and emoticons in their communications. The data was collected from respondents in Bangkok, Thailand using a structured questionnaire between May 14, 2022, and May 31, 2022.    Results: The results from 391 respondents indicated that conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and neuroticism influence perceived enjoyment, while perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have a significant and positive influence on the intention to use paid stickers. Two elements of engagement, interactive engagement, and personal engagement were used to assess the influence of engagement parameters on the behavioral intention to use paid stickers. The intention to employ paid stickers in personal messages was found to be strongly and favorably influenced by these two engagement characteristics. Conclusions: The study recommends that the creators of stickers, emoticons, and emojis should consider user personality features, sticker engagement, sticker simplicity of use, and the personal delight of users in the creative and communication process. The study concludes that perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have a large and favorable impact on the use of paid stickers. The study's main limitation was that it focused on one area of social media. This must be taken into account when applying the findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessing the anticancer effects of metformin [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metformin is an antihyperglycemic biguanide that is used as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin use helps control T2DM which is one of the many risk factors for cancer and is proposed to have multiple antagonistic actions against cancer cells. The epidemiology of cancers in Saudi Arabia are colorectal cancer (CRC) 14.4%, breast cancer 14.2%, thyroid cancer 10.2%, non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 6.1%, leukemia 6%, and other cancers 49.2%. We would like to assess the anticancer effect of metformin on various types of malignancies.  Methods:  The 266 cancer patients diagnosed in 2018–2019 in King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU) were divided into non-diabetic and diabetic cancer patients (with or without metformin).  The data includes age, gender, body mass index (BMI), type of cancer with grades and stages, T2DM, with or without metformin, complications, and fate etc. of each case.  Results: Out of 300, 266 were selected for the analysis. The results showed the statistical significance (p value 0.022) of metformin use on the cancer grade at diagnosis that favorably influences the morbidity/mortality.   Conclusions: Metformin might have an anti-cancer effect on the grade of cancer at the time of diagnosis regardless of its dosage, and this might improve the prognosis of malignancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">New findings on ligand series used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors within the frameworks of molecular docking, molecular quantum similarity and chemical reactivity indices [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus causes an infectious illness named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the Betacoronavirus genus. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has an important role in the viral life cycle and its active site is a very accessible region, thus a potential therapeutic approach may be to target this region to study the inhibition of viral replication. Various preexisting drugs have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and the use of existing antiviral agents may reduce the time and cost of new drug discoveries, but the efficacy of these drugs is limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate a number of ligands used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors to determine the suitability of them for potential COVID-19 treatment. Methods: In this study, we selected a series of ligands used as SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitors such as: abacavir, acyclovir, amprenavir, ascorbic acid vitamin C, azithromycin, baloxavir, boceprevir, cholecalciferol vitamin D, cidofovir, edoxudine, emtricitabine, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. These ligands were analyzed using molecular docking, molecular quantum similarity, and chemical reactivity indices defined within a conceptual density functional theory framework. Results: The analysis of molecular quantum similarity indices on inhibitors showed a high number of differences from a structural point of view. However, they are quite similar in their electronic density, obtaining the highest values in the electronic similarity index. Global and local chemical reactivity indices were analyzed. Conclusions: These studies allowed for the identification of the main stabilizing interactions using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The molecular quantum similarity and chemical reactivity descriptors provide novel insights into these ligands that can be used in the design of new COVID-19 treatments.

                Donnelly et al. show that sequence-specific miRNA decay contributes to the dynamic changes in miRNA repertoire during development. The seed sequence of the mir-35 family drives decay of these miRNAs at the end of embryogenesis, suggesting a selective decay mechanism that can co-regulate all redundant members of a miRNA family.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Klebsiella pneumoniae hijacks the Toll-IL-1R protein SARM1 in a type I IFN-dependent manner to antagonize host immunity</a></h4>

              
                Feriotti et al. uncover how Klebsiella pneumoniae exploits the conserved innate immune protein SARM1 to limit inflammation and to induce IL-10. SARM1 also inhibits K. pneumoniae-induced AIM2 inflammasome. In vivo, absence of SARM1 facilitates the clearance of the pathogen, revealing an Achilles heel of our immune system exploited by Klebsiella.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Nano-organization of spontaneous GABAergic transmission directs its autonomous function in neuronal signaling</a></h4>

              
                Guzikowski and Kavalali took advantage of the molecularly specific interaction of antimalarial artemisinins and an inhibitory synapse scaffold protein, gephyrin, to probe the functional organization of GABAAR-mediated neurotransmission. Their study explores the nano-organization of the GABAergic synapse and the segregation of evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission.

                Neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the leading cause of death and disability in newborns with the only current treatment being hypothermia. An increased understanding of the pathways that facilitate tissue repair after HI may aid the development of better treatments. Here, we study the role of lactate receptor HCAR1 in tissue repair after neonatal HI in mice. We show that HCAR1 knockout mice have reduced tissue regeneration compared with wildtype mice. Furthermore, proliferation of neural progenitor cells and glial cells, as well as microglial activation was impaired. Transcriptome analysis showed a strong transcriptional response to HI in the subventricular zone of wildtype mice involving about 7300 genes. In contrast, the HCAR1 knockout mice showed a modest response, involving about 750 genes. Notably, fundamental processes in tissue repair such as cell cycle and innate immunity were dysregulated in HCAR1 knockout. Our data suggest that HCAR1 is a key transcriptional regulator of pathways that promote tissue regeneration after HI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integrative small and long RNA omics analysis of human healing and nonhealing wounds discovers cooperating microRNAs as therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miR), as important epigenetic control factors, reportedly regulate wound repair. However, our insufficient knowledge of clinically relevant miRs hinders their potential therapeutic use. For this, we performed paired small RNA and long RNA sequencing and integrative omics analysis in human tissue samples, including matched skin and acute wounds collected at each healing stage and chronic non-healing venous ulcers (VU). On the basis of the findings, we developed a compendium  (https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna), which will be an open, comprehensive resource to broadly aid wound healing research. With this first clinical, wound-centric resource of miRs and mRNAs, we identified 17 pathologically relevant miRs that exhibited abnormal VU expression and displayed their targets enriched explicitly in the VU gene signature. Intermeshing regulatory networks controlled by these miRs revealed their high cooperativity in contributing to chronic wound pathology characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-516, upregulated in VU, cooperatively suppressed keratinocyte migration and growth while promoting inflammatory response. By combining miR expression patterns with their specific target gene expression context, we identified miRs highly relevant to VU pathology. Our study opens the possibility of developing innovative wound treatment that targets pathologically relevant cooperating miRs to attain higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Positive feedback regulation of frizzled-7 expression robustly shapes a steep Wnt gradient in Xenopus heart development, together with sFRP1 and heparan sulfate</a></h4>

              
                Secreted molecules called morphogens govern tissue patterning in a concentration-dependent manner. However, it is still unclear how reproducible patterning can be achieved with diffusing molecules, especially when that patterning concerns differentiation of thin tissues. Wnt is a morphogen that organizes cardiac development. Wnt6 patterns cardiogenic mesoderm to induce differentiation of a thin tissue, the pericardium, in <i>Xenopus</i>. In this study, we revealed that a Wnt receptor, <i>frizzled-7</i>, is expressed in a Wnt-dependent manner. With a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling, this receptor-feedback appears essential to shape a steep gradient of Wnt signaling. In addition, computer simulation revealed that this feedback imparts robustness against variations of Wnt ligand production and allows the system to reach a steady state quickly. We also found that a Wnt antagonist sFRP1, which is expressed on the opposite side of the Wnt source, accumulates on N-acetyl-rich heparan sulfate (HS). N-acetyl-rich HS concentration is high between the sources of Wnt and sFRP1, achieving local inhibition of Wnt signaling via restriction of sFRP1 spreading. These integrated regulatory systems restrict the Wnt signaling range and ensure reproducible patterning of the thin pericardium.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Isoform-specific mutation in Dystonin-b gene causes late-onset protein aggregate myopathy and cardiomyopathy</a></h4>

              
                Dystonin (<i>DST</i>), which encodes cytoskeletal linker proteins, expresses three tissue-selective isoforms: neural DST-a, muscular DST-b, and epithelial DST-e. <i>DST</i> mutations cause different disorders, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy 6 (HSAN-VI) and epidermolysis bullosa simplex; however, etiology of the muscle phenotype in <i>DST</i>-related diseases has been unclear. Because <i>DST-b</i> contains all of the <i>DST-a</i>-encoding exons, known HSAN-VI mutations could affect both DST-a and DST-b isoforms. To investigate the specific function of DST-b in striated muscles, we generated a <i>Dst-b</i>-specific mutant mouse model harboring a nonsense mutation. <i>Dst-b</i> mutant mice exhibited late-onset protein aggregate myopathy and cardiomyopathy without neuropathy. We observed desmin aggregation, focal myofibrillar dissolution, and mitochondrial accumulation in striated muscles, which are common characteristics of myofibrillar myopathy. We also found nuclear inclusions containing p62, ubiquitin, and SUMO proteins with nuclear envelope invaginations as a unique pathological hallmark in <i>Dst-b</i> mutation-induced cardiomyopathy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed changes in expression of genes responsible for cardiovascular functions. In silico analysis identified <i>DST-b</i> alleles with nonsense mutations in populations worldwide, suggesting that some unidentified hereditary myopathy and cardiomyopathy are caused by <i>DST-b</i> mutations. Here, we demonstrate that the Dst-b isoform is essential for long-term maintenance of striated muscles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling osteoporosis to design and optimize pharmacological therapies comprising multiple drug types</a></h4>

              
                For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, several drug classes with different mechanisms of action are available. Since only a limited set of dosing regimens and drug combinations can be tested in clinical trials, it is currently unclear whether common medication strategies achieve optimal bone mineral density gains or are outperformed by alternative dosing schemes and combination therapies that have not been explored so far. Here, we develop a mathematical framework of drug interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis that unifies fundamental mechanisms of bone remodeling and the mechanisms of action of four drug classes: bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone analogs, sclerostin inhibitors, and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand inhibitors. Using data from several clinical trials, we calibrate and validate the model, demonstrating its predictive capacity for complex medication scenarios, including sequential and parallel drug combinations. Via simulations, we reveal that there is a large potential to improve gains in bone mineral density by exploiting synergistic interactions between different drug classes, without increasing the total amount of drug administered.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Banp regulates DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during the cell cycle in zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                Btg3-associated nuclear protein (Banp) was originally identified as a nuclear matrix-associated region (MAR)-binding protein and it functions as a tumor suppressor. At the molecular level, Banp regulates transcription of metabolic genes via a CGCG-containing motif called the Banp motif. However, its physiological roles in embryonic development are unknown. Here, we report that Banp is indispensable for the DNA damage response and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Zebrafish <i>banp</i> mutants show mitotic cell accumulation and apoptosis in developing retina. We found that DNA replication stress and tp53-dependent DNA damage responses were activated to induce apoptosis in <i>banp</i> mutants, suggesting that Banp is required for regulation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Furthermore, consistent with mitotic cell accumulation, chromosome segregation was not smoothly processed from prometaphase to anaphase in <i>banp</i> morphants, leading to a prolonged M-phase. Our RNA- and ATAC-sequencing identified 31 candidates for direct Banp target genes that carry the Banp motif. Interestingly, a DNA replication fork regulator, <i>wrnip1,</i> and two chromosome segregation regulators, <i>cenpt</i> and <i>ncapg</i>, are included in this list. Thus, Banp directly regulates transcription of <i>wrnip1</i> for recovery from DNA replication stress, and <i>cenpt</i> and <i>ncapg</i> for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that Banp is required for cell-cycle progression and cell survival by regulating DNA damage responses and chromosome segregation during mitosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SMAD4 and TGFβ are architects of inverse genetic programs during fate-determination of antiviral CTLs</a></h4>

              
                Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an important differentiation factor for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and alters the expression levels of several of homing-receptors during infection. SMAD4 is part of the canonical signaling network used by members of the transforming growth factor family. For this study, genetically-modified mice were used to determine how SMAD4 and TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII) participate in transcriptional-programing of pathogen-specific CTLs. We show that these molecules are essential components of opposing signaling mechanisms, and cooperatively regulate a collection of genes that determine whether specialized populations of pathogen-specific CTLs circulate around the body, or settle in peripheral tissues. TGFb uses a canonical SMAD-dependent signaling pathway to down-regulate Eomesodermin (EOMES), KLRG1 and CD62L, while CD103 is induced. Conversely, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> data show that EOMES, KLRG1, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 and CD62L are positively-regulated via SMAD4, while CD103 and Hobit are downregulated. Intravascular staining shows that signaling via SMAD4 promotes formation of terminally-differentiated CTLs that localize in the vasculature. Our data shows that inflammatory molecules play a key role in lineage-determination of pathogen-specific CTLs, and use SMAD-dependent signaling to alter the expression levels of multiple homing-receptors and transcription factors with known functions during memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defining the ultrastructure of the hematopoietic stem cell niche by correlative light and electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The blood system is supported by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in a specialized microenvironment called the niche. Many different niche cell types support HSPCs, however how they interact and their ultrastructure has been difficult to define. Here we show that single endogenous HSPCs can be tracked by light microscopy, then identified by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) at multiscale levels. Using the zebrafish larval kidney marrow (KM) niche as a model, we followed single fluorescently-labeled HSPCs by light sheet microscopy, then confirmed their exact location in a 3D SBEM dataset. We found a variety of different configurations of HSPCs and surrounding niche cells, suggesting there could be functional heterogeneity in sites of HSPC lodgement. Our approach also allowed us to identify dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dbh) positive ganglion cells as a previously uncharacterized functional cell type in the HSPC niche. By integrating multiple imaging modalities, we could resolve the ultrastructure of single rare cells deep in live tissue and define all contacts between an HSPC and its surrounding niche cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in South Africa and epidemiological characteristics of three variants of concern (Beta, Delta, and Omicron)</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have been key drivers of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves. To better understand variant epidemiologic characteristics, here we apply a model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa, a country that has experienced three VOC pandemic waves (i.e. Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) by February 2022. We estimate key epidemiologic quantities in each of the nine South African provinces during March 2020 to February 2022, while accounting for changing detection rates, infection seasonality, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination. Model validation shows that estimated underlying infection rates and key parameters (e.g. infection-detection rate and infection-fatality risk) are in line with independent epidemiological data and investigations. In addition, retrospective predictions capture pandemic trajectories beyond the model training period. These detailed, validated model-inference estimates thus enable quantification of both the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, that is, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. These findings help elucidate changing COVID-19 dynamics and inform future public health planning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pre-existing chromosomal polymorphisms in pathogenic E. coli potentiate the evolution of resistance to a last-resort antibiotic</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial pathogens show high levels of chromosomal genetic diversity, but the influence of this diversity on the evolution of antibiotic resistance by plasmid acquisition remains unclear. Here, we address this problem in the context of colistin, a ‘last line of defence’ antibiotic. Using experimental evolution, we show that a plasmid carrying the MCR-1 colistin resistance gene dramatically increases the ability of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to evolve high-level colistin resistance by acquiring mutations in <i>lpxC</i>, an essential chromosomal gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Crucially, <i>lpxC</i> mutations increase colistin resistance in the presence of the MCR-1 gene, but decrease the resistance of wild-type cells, revealing positive sign epistasis for antibiotic resistance between the chromosomal mutations and a mobile resistance gene. Analysis of public genomic datasets shows that <i>lpxC</i> polymorphisms are common in pathogenic <i>E. coli,</i> including those carrying MCR-1, highlighting the clinical relevance of this interaction. Importantly, <i>lpxC</i> diversity is high in pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> from regions with no history of MCR-1 acquisition, suggesting that pre-existing <i>lpxC</i> polymorphisms potentiated the evolution of high-level colistin resistance by MCR-1 acquisition. More broadly, these findings highlight the importance of standing genetic variation and plasmid/chromosomal interactions in the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporal analysis of enhancers during mouse cerebellar development reveals dynamic and novel regulatory functions</a></h4>

              
                We have identified active enhancers in the mouse cerebellum at embryonic and postnatal stages which provides a view of novel enhancers active during cerebellar development. The majority of cerebellar enhancers have dynamic activity between embryonic and postnatal development. Cerebellar enhancers were enriched for neural transcription factor binding sites with temporally specific expression. Putative gene targets displayed spatially restricted expression patterns, indicating cell-type specific expression regulation. Functional analysis of target genes indicated that enhancers regulate processes spanning several developmental epochs such as specification, differentiation and maturation. We use these analyses to discover one novel regulator and one novel marker of cerebellar development: Bhlhe22 and Pax3, respectively. We identified an enrichment of <i>de novo</i> mutations and variants associated with autism spectrum disorder in cerebellar enhancers. Furthermore, by comparing our data with relevant brain development ENCODE histone profiles and cerebellar single-cell datasets we have been able to generalize and expand on the presented analyses, respectively. We have made the results of our analyses available online in the Developing Mouse Cerebellum Enhancer Atlas (https://goldowitzlab.shinyapps.io/developing_mouse_cerebellum_enhancer_atlas/), where our dataset can be efficiently queried, curated and exported by the scientific community to facilitate future research efforts. Our study provides a valuable resource for studying the dynamics of gene expression regulation by enhancers in the developing cerebellum and delivers a rich dataset of novel gene-enhancer associations providing a basis for future in-depth studies in the cerebellum.

                The ability to use information from one's prior actions is necessary for decision-making. While Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been hypothesized as key for inferences made using cue and value-related information, whether OFC populations contribute to the use of information from volitional actions to guide behavior is not clear. Here, we used a self-paced lever-press hold down task in which mice infer prior lever press durations to guide subsequent action performance. We show that activity of genetically identified lateral OFC subpopulations differentially instantiate current and prior action information during ongoing action execution. Transient state-dependent lOFC circuit disruptions of specified subpopulations reduced the encoding of ongoing press durations but did not disrupt the use of prior action information to guide future action performance. In contrast, a chronic functional loss of lOFC circuit activity resulted in increased reliance on recently executed lever press durations and impaired contingency reversal, suggesting the recruitment of compensatory mechanisms that resulted in repetitive action control. Our results identify a novel role for lOFC in the integration of action information to guide adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF stimulates the retrograde pathway for axonal autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway important for neuronal development, function, and survival. But how autophagy in axons is regulated by neurotrophins to impact neuronal viability and function is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the regulation of axonal autophagy by the neurotrophin BDNF, and elucidate whether autophagosomes carry BDNF-mediated signaling information. We find that BDNF induces autophagic flux in primary neurons by stimulating the retrograde pathway for autophagy in axons. We observed an increase in autophagosome density and retrograde flux in axons, and a corresponding increase in autophagosome density in the soma. However, we find little evidence of autophagosomes co-migrating with BDNF. In contrast, BDNF effectively engages its cognate receptor TrkB to undergo retrograde transport in the axon. These compartments, however, are distinct from LC3-positive autophagic organelles in the axon. Together, we find that BDNF stimulates autophagy in the axon, but retrograde autophagosomes do not appear to carry neurotrophin-based signaling information. Thus, BDNF likely stimulates autophagy as a consequence of BDNF-induced processes that require canonical roles for autophagy in degradation, rather than unconventional roles in neurotrophin signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ADAMTS2 regulates radial neuronal migration by activating TGF-β signaling at the subplate layer of the developing neocortex</a></h4>

              
                During the development of the mammalian brain, neocortical structures are formed by the sequential radial migration of newborn excitatory neurons. The early migrating neurons exhibit a multipolar shape, but they undergo a multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the subplate (SP) layer, where extracellular matrix (ECM) components are abundantly expressed. In this study, we revealed that the TGF-{beta}; signaling-related ECM proteins, such as latent TGF-{beta}-binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and fibrillin 2, and TGF-{beta} receptor II (TGF-{beta}RII) and its downstream effector, p-smad2/3, are selectively expressed at the SP layer, suggesting that TGF-{beta} is sequestered in a latent form by forming complexes with these ECM components and then its signaling is activated by ECM remodeling. We found that the migrating multipolar neurons transiently express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 2 (ADAMTS2), an ECM metalloproteinase, just below the SP layer. Knockdown and knockout of Adamts2 suppressed the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons, and therefore, disturbed radial migration. Similar phenotypes were observed by the perturbation of TGF-{beta} signaling in the migrating neurons. Time-lapse luminescence imaging of TGF-{beta} signaling indicated that ADAMTS2 activates this signaling pathway in the migrating neurons during the multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the SP layer. These results suggest that the ADAMTS2 secreted by the migrating multipolar neurons activates TGF-{beta} signaling by ECM remodeling of the SP layer, leading to the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. We propose that the SP layer plays an essential role in the radial neuronal migration as a signaling center of the developing neocortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The delta-opioid receptor bidirectionally modulates itch</a></h4>

              
                Opioid signaling has been shown to be critically important in the neuromodulation of sensory circuits in the superficial spinal cord. Agonists of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) elicit itch, whereas agonists of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) have been shown to inhibit itch. Despite the clear roles of MOR and KOR for the modulation itch, whether the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) is involved in the regulation of itch remained unknown. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of DOR agonists suppresses chemical itch and that intrathecal application of DOR antagonists is sufficient to evoke itch. We identify that spinal enkephalin neurons co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY), a peptide previously implicated in the inhibition of itch. In the spinal cord, DOR overlapped with both the NPY receptor (NPY1R) and KOR, suggesting that DOR neurons represent a site for convergent itch information in the dorsal horn. Lastly, we found that neurons co-expressing DOR and KOR showed significant Fos induction following pruritogen-evoked itch. These results uncover a role for DOR in the modulation of itch in the superficial dorsal horn.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional Neuroligin-2-MDGA1 interactions differentially regulate synaptic GABAARs and cytosolic gephyrin aggregation</a></h4>

              
                The function of GABAergic synapses is critically shaped by cell adhesion proteins that recruit GABAARs to synapses and mediate transsynaptic signalling, but the synapse-type-specific function of such synaptic adhesion proteins and their mutual interaction remain incompletely understood. A ubiquitous cell adhesion protein at GABAergic synapses is Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), which recruits synaptic GABAARs by promoting the assembly of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold. While Nlgn2 is present at virtually all GABAergic synapses throughout the forebrain, its loss affects different GABAergic synapse subtypes with different severity, indicating that synapse-specific interactors and synapse-organizer-redundancies define the function of Nlgn2 for a given synapse type. Here we investigated how Nlgn2 function at GABAergic synapses in mouse hippocampal area CA1 is modulated by two recently identified interaction partners, MDGA1 and MDGA2. We show that Nlgn2 and MDGA1 colocalize most prominently in the stratum radiatum (S.R.) of area CA1, and that combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion causes a layer-specific exacerbation of the loss of gephyrin puncta in layer S.R. seen following Nlgn2 deletion. Intriguingly, combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion concurrently ameliorates the abnormal cytosolic gephyrin aggregation, the reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission and the exacerbated anxiety behavior seen in Nlgn2 knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, heterozygous deletion of MDGA2 in Nlgn2 KO mice has only minor effects on gephyrin and GABAAR puncta and does not normalize cytosolic gephyrin aggregates, inhibitory synaptic transmission or anxiety-related behavior. Our data indicate that MDGA1, but not MDGA2, modulates Nlgn2 function, primarily by regulating the formation of cytosolic gephyrin aggregates. Given that both Nlgn2 and the MDGA family of proteins have been linked to psychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, our data lead to the notion that abnormal gephyrin aggregation may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders, and that intervention with gephyrin aggregation could present a novel therapeutic strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biomechanical origins of proprioceptive maps in the Drosophila leg</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception, the sense of body position and movement, is essential for effective motor control. Because proprioceptive sensory neurons are embedded in complex and dynamic tissues, it has been challenging to understand how they sense and encode mechanical stimuli. Here, we find that proprioceptor neurons in the Drosophila femur are organized into functional groups that are biomechanically specialized to detect features of tibia joint kinematics. The dendrites of position and vibration-tuned proprioceptors receive distinct mechanical signals via the arculum, an elegant mechanical structure that decomposes movement of the tibia joint into orthogonal components. The cell bodies of position-tuned proprioceptors form a goniotopic map of joint angle, whereas the dendrites of vibration-tuned proprioceptors form a tonotopic map of tibia vibration frequency. Our findings reveal biomechanical mechanisms that underlie proprioceptor feature selectivity and identify common organizational principles between proprioception and other topographically organized sensory systems.

	<p>Bone fracture following traumatic injury or due to osteoporosis is characterized by severe pain and motor impairment and is a major cause of global mortality and disability. Fracture pain often originates from mechanical distortion of somatosensory nerve terminals innervating bones and muscles and is maintained by central sensitization. Chronic fracture pain (CFP) after orthopedic repairs is considered one of the most critical contributors to interference with the physical rehabilitation and musculoskeletal functional recovery. Analgesics available for CFP in clinics not only have poor curative potency but also have considerable side effects; therefore, it is important to further explore the pathogenesis of CFP and identify safe and effective therapies. The typical physiopathological characteristics of CFP are a neuroinflammatory response and excitatory synaptic plasticity, but the specific molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly elucidated. Recent progress has deepened our understanding of the emerging properties of chemokine production, proinflammatory mediator secretion, caspase activation, neurotransmitter release, and neuron-glia interaction in initiating and sustaining synaptogenesis, synaptic strength, and signal transduction in central pain sensitization, indicating the possibility of targeting neuroinflammation to prevent and treat CFP. This review summarizes current literature on the excitatory synaptic plasticity, microgliosis, and microglial activation-associated signaling molecules and discusses the unconventional modulation of caspases and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in the pathophysiology of CFP. We also review the mechanisms of action of analgesics in the clinic and their side effects as well as promising therapeutic candidates (e.g., specialized pro-resolving mediators, a caspase-6 inhibitor, and a STING agonist) for pain relief by the attenuation of neuroinflammation with the aim of better managing patients undergoing CFP in the clinical setting.</p>

	<p>The central nervous system (CNS) control of human gait is complex, including descending cortical control, affective ascending neural pathways, interhemispheric communication, whole brain networks of functional connectivity, and neural interactions between the brain and spinal cord. Many important studies were conducted in the past, which administered gait training using externally targeted methods such as treadmill, weight support, over-ground gait coordination training, functional electrical stimulation, bracing, and walking aids. Though the phenomenon of CNS activity-dependent plasticity has served as a basis for more recently developed gait training methods, neurorehabilitation gait training has yet to be precisely focused and quantified according to the CNS source of gait control. Therefore, we offer the following hypotheses to the field: Hypothesis 1. Gait neurorehabilitation after stroke will move forward in important ways if research studies include brain structural and functional characteristics as measures of response to treatment. Hypothesis 2. Individuals with persistent gait dyscoordination after stroke will achieve greater recovery in response to interventions that incorporate the current and emerging knowledge of CNS function by directly engaging CNS plasticity and pairing it with peripherally directed, plasticity-based motor learning interventions. These hypotheses are justified by the increase in the study of neural control of motor function, with emerging research beginning to elucidate neural factors that drive recovery. Some are developing new measures of brain function. A number of groups have developed and are sharing sophisticated, curated databases containing brain images and brain signal data, as well as other types of measures and signal processing methods for data analysis. It will be to the great advantage of stroke survivors if the results of the current state-of-the-art and emerging neural function research can be applied to the development of new gait training interventions.</p>

	<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), among which the therapeutic targets commonly used include the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is one of the common motor complications arising in PD patients on chronic treatment with levodopa. In this article, we retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of LID with the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) in patients who underwent DBS in multiple centers with a GPi or an STN target. Meanwhile, the Med off MDS-Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-&amp;amp;#8546;) and the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) were also observed as secondary indicators. PD patients with a GPi target showed a more significant improvement in the UDysRS compared with an STN target (92.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.7% vs. 66.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Both the GPi and the STN showed similar improvement in Med off UPDRS-III scores (49.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.6% vs. 52.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 29.5%, p = 0.5458). However, the LEDD was obviously reduced with the STN target compared with the GPi target (44.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28.1% vs. 12.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 45.8%, p = 0.006).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neuromodulation Reduces Interindividual Variability of Neuronal Output</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In similar states, neural circuits produce similar outputs across individuals despite substantial interindividual variability in neuronal ionic conductances and synapses. Circuit states are largely shaped by neuromodulators that tune ionic conductances. It is therefore possible that, in addition to producing flexible circuit output, neuromodulators also contribute to output similarity despite varying ion channel expression. We studied whether neuromodulation at saturating concentrations can increase the output similarity of a single identified neuron across individual animals. Using the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we compared the variability of <I>f&ndash;I</I> (frequency&ndash;current) curves and rebound properties in the presence of neuropeptides. The two neuropeptides we used converge to activate the same target current, which increases neuronal excitability. Output variability was lower in the presence of the neuropeptides, regardless of whether the neuropeptides significantly changed the mean of the corresponding parameter or not. However, the addition of the second neuropeptide did not add further to the reduction of variability. With a family of computational LP-like models, we explored how increased excitability and target variability contribute to output similarity and found two mechanisms: saturation of the responses and a differential increase in baseline activity. Saturation alone can reduce the interindividual variability only if the population shares a similar ceiling for the responses. In contrast, the reduction of variability due to the increase in baseline activity is independent of ceiling effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Probiotic effect in preterm neonates with sepsis - A systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The microbiota in the intestine is made up of trillions of living bacteria that coexist with the host. Administration of antibiotics during neonatal infection causes depletion of gut flora resulting in gut dysbiosis. Over the last few decades, probiotics have been created and promoted as microbiota management agents to enrich gut flora. Probiotics decrease the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut of preterm neonates, reducing the frequency of nosocomial infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICUs). Methods: The systematic review will include randomized control trials (RCTs) of premier neonates with sepsis. Studies will be retrieved from global databases like Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus via EBSCO host, MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Ovid, Web of Science, ProQuest Medical Library, Microsoft academic, and DOAJ by utilizing database-specific keywords. Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal of included research will be carried out separately by two review writers. Findings will be reported in accordance with the PRISMS-P 2020 guidelines. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review will help to translate the evidence-based information needed to encourage the implementation of potential research output in the field of neonatal intensive care, guide best clinical practise, assist policy making and implementation to prevent gut dysbiosis in neonates with sepsis by summarising and communicating the evidence on the topic. PROSPERO registration number: This systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) on 10th March 2022. The registration number is CRD42022315980.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pharmacy practitioners’ attitudes and practice towards herbal products in Jordan: Exploring their knowledge about herbal products potential interactions with cardiovascular medications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicine use is widespread among patients, as community pharmacies may provide such products. Therefore, pharmacy practitioners should be aware of potential herbal products’ adverse effects and herb-drug interactions, particularly with medications for comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular drugs, in which pharmacy practitioners need to have good knowledge to provide patients with relevant advice to get optimal and safe therapeutic outcomes. Accordingly, the study is designed to assess the knowledge and awareness of pharmacy practitioners regarding herbal product dispensing and cardiovascular drug interaction in Jordan and view their role in patients’ counselling to set up safe and effective drug use. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jordan using an online formatted questionnaire distributed to pharmacy practitioners working in community pharmacies. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed for the responses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 26. Results: Out of 508 participants, 41.7% had medium knowledge of herbal products pertaining mainly to university education (68.1%); 55.1% of participants dispensed herbal products without prescriptions for obesity and weight reduction (72.8%) and gastrointestinal problems (70.9%); this is because respondents agreed that herbal remedies are safe (28.5%) and effective (38.4%). Whilst the knowledge level of respondents about herbal medicine interaction with cardiovascular medication was medium, with a mean of 1.94, as this interaction may result in potentially serious consequences, 40.7% of respondents strongly agreed to gain more knowledge about the side effects of herbal products and medicine interactions through educational courses. Conclusions: The pharmacy practitioners had medium knowledge of herbal products; however, more attention should be paid to herb-drug interactions in the pharmacy educational curriculum. Additionally, pharmacy practitioners need to refresh their knowledge by attending periodic educational courses and by using reliable resources for information about herbal products in order to provide effective and competent pharmaceutical care.

These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three types of  DNA sequences: RBD cDNA, FP (fusion peptide) DNA and sfGFP(superfolder-green-fluorescent-protein), cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open-reading-frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic-interaction-chromatography), detected with a BioVision-Elisa-Kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm and immune simulation will be carried out using C57BL mice.  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant) gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure immunoreactive RBD protein.  Conclusion: A positive BioVision-ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Statistical models for the deterioration of kidney function in a primary care population: A retrospective database analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence for kidney function monitoring intervals in primary care is weak, and based mainly on expert opinion. In the absence of trials of monitoring strategies, an approach combining a model for the natural history of kidney function over time combined with a cost-effectiveness analysis offers the most feasible approach for comparing the effects of monitoring under a variety of policies. This study aimed to create a model for kidney disease progression using routinely collected measures of kidney function. Methods: This is an open cohort study of patients aged ≥18 years, registered at 643 UK general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2014. At study entry, no patients were kidney transplant donors or recipients, pregnant or on dialysis. Hidden Markov models for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stage progression were fitted to four patient cohorts defined by baseline albuminuria stage; adjusted for sex, history of heart failure, cancer, hypertension and diabetes, annually updated for age. Results: Of 1,973,068 patients, 1,921,949 had no recorded urine albumin at baseline, 37,947 had normoalbuminuria (<3mg/mmol), 10,248 had microalbuminuria (3–30mg/mmol), and 2,924 had macroalbuminuria (>30mg/mmol). Estimated annual transition probabilities were 0.75–1.3%, 1.5–2.5%, 3.4–5.4% and 3.1–11.9% for each cohort, respectively. Misclassification of eGFR stage was estimated to occur in 12.1% (95%CI: 11.9–12.2%) to 14.7% (95%CI: 14.1–15.3%) of tests. Male gender, cancer, heart failure and age were independently associated with declining renal function, whereas the impact of raised blood pressure and glucose on renal function was entirely predicted by albuminuria. Conclusions: True kidney function deteriorates slowly over time, declining more sharply with elevated urine albumin, increasing age, heart failure, cancer and male gender. Consecutive eGFR measurements should be interpreted with caution as observed improvement or deterioration may be due to misclassification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dysbiosis: Gut feeling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A healthy host-microbiome relationship, crucial for intestinal homeostasis, is established early in postnatal life. Imbalance in the neonatal microbiome may lead to the development of chronic pathological conditions later in life. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is increasingly being linked to the etiology of both intestinal and systemic illnesses such as irritable bowel disease (IBD), cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, as well as kidney and neurological disorders. Gut dysbiosis also leads to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite substantial research, little is known about the interactions between microorganisms, their hosts, and their environments, or whether dysbiosis is a cause or consequence of disease. According to a recent hypothesis, bacterial species living in the mucus layer of the colon may determine whether cellular homeostasis is retained or inflammatory processes are elicited, either through direct interaction with intestinal epithelium or indirectly via bacterial metabolites. Recently, high throughput deep-sequencing technology has enabled the characterization of the microbiota in patients suffering from intestinal or extra-intestinal disorders, and a strong association between dysbiosis and disease development was found. However, specific disease drivers still need to be identified in most cases. Small compounds and metabolites produced by gut bacterial flora act as signaling molecules, such as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that can profoundly influence host physiology. These metabolites play a crucial role in modulating gut-brain crosstalk. There is growing evidence that neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson’s and others, may originate or be exaggerated in response to microbial dysbiosis either directly or indirectly interfering with the drugs through metabolites. The present evidence on the role of the gut microbiota in disease development and drug metabolism is summarized in this review. Based on available studies, we can explore the potential of gut flora to alleviate disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mapping accessibility to oral health care in coastal India – A geospatial approach using a geographic information system (GIS) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is imperative to have a thorough assessment of the existing distribution of oral healthcare facilities and understand potential accessibility when planning for expansion of oral health services. In the present study, an attempt to measure geographic accessibility to oral healthcare, by locating the availability of dental practitioners in the coastal districts of Karnataka state, India using a geographical information system (GIS), has been made. Methods: For the study, data on public and private oral health centres were collected for the three coastal districts of Karnataka state, India. Population and income data were collected, along with geographic attributes (latitudes and longitudes) of the practitioners' addresses. Descriptive statistical analyses and dentist-to-population ratios (D:P) were calculated. Correlation between the number of clinics with population and D:P with per capita income were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Chi-square test applied to analyze any association between D:P and urbanization. Results: Among 340 clinics, 8.5% are public and 91.5% are private clinics catering to a population of 4,704,179. Average D:P for the three coastal districts is 1:13,836. There is an uneven urban-rural distribution of dentists with lower D:P in rural areas. Rural population in four taluks have only one dentist for over a lakh population. Six taluks have only one dentist for every 50000 – 100000 population in rural areas. Six rural areas had only public centers to cater to their oral health.   Conclusions: From the study, it is concluded that oral health services were concentrated in areas with higher annual income per-capita, increased urbanization and population density.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Student teachers' perceptions of the collaborative relationships between universities and inclusive elementary schools in Indonesia [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools has not been maximally practiced. The form of collaboration that universities with inclusive elementary schools have carried out is still limited to the need to complete lecture materials during the semester. There is a gap between the theory and practice obtained by student teachers at universities when they have to teach in inclusive elementary schools. As a result, they have not contributed to solving problems that occur in inclusive elementary schools. The collaborative relationship between inclusive elementary schools and universities directly implies that the success of inclusive education is determined by the competence of student teachers whose lecturers have successfully educated them in order to teach in inclusive elementary schools. Compared to the background that the inclusive education system is developing in Indonesia, the researchers investigated student teachers' perceptions at universities regarding inclusive university-inclusive elementary school collaborative relationships. Methods: During data collection, an online survey and in-depth interviews of student teachers about individual experiences and their ideas about the form of inclusive elementary schools-university partnerships was conducted. The data analysis used was a thematic analysis technique. Result: The result summarizes student teachers' statements, revealed three main themes: provision of inclusive education needs, research, and field practice. The student teachers revealed that the collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools is essential in order to develop holistic, inclusive practices in a collaborative partnership based on input-needs, which has a two-way impact or benefit for both parties. Conclusions: Furthermore, collaborative relationships must be in the form of long-term programs, such as continuous assistance, and adaptation to the development of inclusive education through lecture materials. To achieve successful inclusive education in Indonesia, we also recommended that the government make policies on multi-sectoral collaboration in order to support inclusive education.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatiotemporal dynamics of human high gamma discriminate naturalistic behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Abdulwahab Alasfour, Paolo Gabriel, Xi Jiang, Isaac Shamie, Lucia Melloni, Thomas Thesen, Patricia Dugan, Daniel Friedman, Werner Doyle, Orin Devinsky, David Gonda, Shifteh Sattar, Sonya Wang, Eric Halgren, Vikash Gilja</p>

In analyzing the neural correlates of naturalistic and unstructured behaviors, features of neural activity that are ignored in a trial-based experimental paradigm can be more fully studied and investigated. Here, we analyze neural activity from two patients using electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings, and reveal that multiple neural signal characteristics exist that discriminate between unstructured and naturalistic behavioral states such as “engaging in dialogue” and “using electronics”. Using the high gamma amplitude as an estimate of neuronal firing rate, we demonstrate that behavioral states in a naturalistic setting are discriminable based on long-term mean shifts, variance shifts, and differences in the specific neural activity’s covariance structure. Both the rapid and slow changes in high gamma band activity separate unstructured behavioral states. We also use Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) to show the existence of salient spatiotemporal features with variable smoothness in time. Further, we demonstrate that both temporally smooth and stochastic spatiotemporal activity can be used to differentiate unstructured behavioral states. This is the first attempt to elucidate how different neural signal features contain information about behavioral states collected outside the conventional experimental paradigm.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">From kill the winner to eliminate the winner in open phage-bacteria systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anastasios Marantos, Namiko Mitarai, Kim Sneppen</p>

Phages and bacteria manage to coexist and sustain ecosystems with a high diversity of strains, despite limited resources and heavy predation. This diversity can be explained by the “kill the winner” model where virulent phages predominantly prey on fast-growing bacteria and thereby suppress the competitive exclusion of slower-growing bacteria. Here we computationally investigate the robustness of these systems against invasions, where new phages or bacteria may interact with more than one of the resident strains. The resulting interaction networks were found to self-organize into a network with strongly interacting specialized predator-prey pairs, resembling that of the “kill the winner” model. Furthermore, the “kill the winner” dynamics is enforced with the occasional elimination of even the fastest-growing bacteria strains due to a phage infecting the fast and slow growers. The frequency of slower-growing strains was increased with the introduction of even a few non-diagonal interactions. Hence, phages capable of infecting multiple hosts play significant roles both in the evolution of the ecosystem by eliminating the winner and in supporting diversity by allowing slow growers to coexist with faster growers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insertions and deletions as phylogenetic signal in an alignment-free context</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Niklas Birth, Thomas Dencker, Burkhard Morgenstern</p>

Most methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction are based on sequence alignments; they infer phylogenies from substitutions that may have occurred at the aligned sequence positions. Gaps in alignments are usually not employed as phylogenetic signal. In this paper, we explore an alignment-free approach that uses insertions and deletions (indels) as an additional source of information for phylogeny inference. For a set of four or more input sequences, we generate so-called <i>quartet blocks</i> of four putative homologous segments each. For <i>pairs</i> of such quartet blocks involving the same four sequences, we compare the distances between the two blocks in these sequences, to obtain hints about indels that may have happened between the blocks since the respective four sequences have evolved from their last common ancestor. A prototype implementation that we call <i>Gap-SpaM</i> is presented to infer phylogenetic trees from these data, using a <i>quartet-tree</i> approach or, alternatively, under the <i>maximum-parsimony</i> paradigm. This approach should not be regarded as an alternative to established methods, but rather as a complementary source of phylogenetic information. Interestingly, however, our software is able to produce phylogenetic trees from putative indels alone that are comparable to trees obtained with existing alignment-free methods.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that has rapidly spread across the world with a detrimental effect on the global population. Several reports have highlighted an increased mortality rate and a higher severity of COVID-19 infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD) individuals. Upon the development of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, mRNA vaccines including BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were deemed safe, with a high efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in the general population. This review investigates whether  SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are as effective in triggering an immune response in Dialysis Patients (DPs) and Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs) and if a third dose is required in this  population. Methods: A systematic search employing the PRISMA criteria was conducted in several major databases, with the data being extracted from publications for the period January 2021 to May 2022 (PROSPERO: CRD42022338514, June 15, 2022). Results: 80 studies were included in this analysis with a total cohort number of 15,059 participants. Overall, 85.29% (OR = 17.08, 95% CI = 15.84-18.42, I2 = 98%) and 41.06% (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.48-0.5, I2 = 95%) of DPs and KTRs included in this review showed positive seroconversion after two doses of either mRNA vaccine, respectively. A total 76% (OR = 6.53, 95% CI = 5.63-7.5, I2 = 96%) of the cohort given a third dose of an mRNA vaccine demonstrated positive seroconversion, with 61.86% (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.95-2.75 I2 = 95%) of the cohort that was assessed for a cellular response displaying a positive response. Conclusions: This data emphasises a reduced incidence of a positive immune response in DPs and KTRs compared to healthy controls, albeit a better response in DPs than when compared to KTRs alone was observed. A third dose  appears to increase the occurrence of an immune response in the overall DP/KTR cohort.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The first report on detecting SARS-CoV-2 inside bacteria of  the human gut microbiome: A case series on asymptomatic family members and a child with COVID-19 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Many studies report the importance of using feces as source sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 symptoms but who are negative to oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal tests. Here, we report the case of an asymptomatic child whose family members had negative results with the rapid antigen nasopharyngeal swab tests. The 21-month-old child presented with fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis, and conspicuous lacrimation. In this study, analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples by using Luminex technology allowed accurate detection of the presence of the viral RNA in the feces of the child and of all her relatives, which thus resulted to be positive but asymptomatic. It is the first time that SARS-CoV-2- is observed inside bacteria of the human gut microbiome and outside a matrix resembling extracellular bacterial lysates, in agreement with a bacteriophage mechanism with the images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), post-embedding immunogold, and by fluorescence microscope. In addition to the typical observations of respiratory symptoms, accurate evaluation of clinical gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, combined with efficient highly sensitive molecular testing on feces, represent an efficient approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and for providing the correct therapy in challenging COVID-19 cases, like the one here reported.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of responsible research practices among academics in The Netherlands [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, research integrity studies have focused on research misbehaviors and their explanations. Over time, attention has shifted towards preventing questionable research practices and promoting responsible ones. However, data on the prevalence of responsible research practices, especially open methods, open codes and open data and their underlying associative factors, remains scarce. Methods: We conducted a web-based anonymized questionnaire, targeting all academic researchers working at or affiliated to a university or university medical center in The Netherlands, to investigate the prevalence and potential explanatory factors of 11 responsible research practices. Results: A total of 6,813 academics completed the survey, the results of which show that prevalence of responsible practices differs substantially across disciplines and ranks, with 99 percent avoiding plagiarism in their work but less than 50 percent pre-registering a research protocol. Arts and humanities scholars as well as PhD candidates and junior researchers engaged less often in responsible research practices. Publication pressure negatively affected responsible practices, while mentoring, scientific norms subscription and funding pressure stimulated them. Conclusions: Understanding the prevalence of responsible research practices across disciplines and ranks, as well as their associated explanatory factors, can help to systematically address disciplinary- and academic rank-specific obstacles, and thereby facilitate responsible conduct of research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainability of the regional financial system: a case study of the Northwestern Federal District [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article provides an assessment of the sustainability of Russian regions’ financial systems. The study is based on the methods of generalization and synthesis, correlation-regression analysis, and multivariate classification. Since the structure of the regional financial system is complex, several works are devoted to studying its sustainability issues. The relevance of the study topic is confirmed by the lack of a systematic approach to assessing the integral index of sustainability and the possibility of using various tools in determining the complex indicator. Methods: This  methodology with application of mathematical statistics methods makes it possible to assess the financial system sustainability in four sectors, to include the leading indicators in the assessment, and to identify regions with extreme values of debt burden indicators. The method was tested for the regions of the Northwestern Federal District (NWFD) for the period 2010 - 2019  to classify the regions according to three levels of debt sustainability. Data collection from the 1st January to 30th April 2022 included statistical data from government open internet sources, sectors studied relate to government, and municipal budgets in the NWFD. Authors analyzed regional debt sustainability indicators and identified themes in the field of sustainability studies for the NWFD. Results: An increased level of financial system sustainability was observed among the  NWFD regions in the corporative and personal finance sectors, indicating a significant contribution of businesses and households to maintaining the balance and sustainability of the financial system in Russia as a whole. The results of the study also identified that the NWFD regions belong to three clusters: cluster 1 - high debt sustainability; cluster 2 - medium debt sustainability; and cluster 3 - low debt sustainability. Conclusions: The study results allowed the identification of regions with a constantly high level of debt, financial, and corporative sustainability.

                Alternative splicing produces multiple functional transcripts from a single gene. Dysregulation of splicing is known to be associated with disease and as a hallmark of cancer. Existing tools for differential transcript usage (DTU) analysis either lack in performance, cannot account for complex experimental designs or do not scale to massive single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. We introduce satuRn, a fast and flexible quasi-binomial generalized linear modelling framework that is on par with the best performing DTU methods from the bulk RNA-seq realm, while providing good false discovery rate control, addressing complex experimental designs, and scaling to scRNA-seq applications.

                Background: Adherence to insulin and blood glucose monitoring (BGM) is insufficient in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) worldwide and in Qatar. Little is known about the factors related to being aware of non-adherence and the beliefs related to non-adherence in this group. This qualitative study investigated factors related to awareness of, and beliefs about non-adherence, as well as the existence of specific action plans to combat non-adherence using the I-Change model. Methods: The target group was comprised of 20 Arab AYAs (17–24 years of age) with T1D living in Qatar. Participants were interviewed via semi-structured, face-to-face individual interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the Framework Method. Results: Suboptimal adherence to insulin, and particularly to BGM, in AYAs with T1D was identified. Some AYAs reported to have little awareness about the consequences of their non-adherence and how this can adversely affect optimal diabetes management. Participants also associated various disadvantages to adherence (e.g., hypoglycemia, pain, among others) and reported low self-efficacy in being adherent (e.g., when outside home, in a bad mood, among others). Additionally, goal setting and action-planning often appeared to be lacking. Factors facilitating adherence were receiving support from family and healthcare providers, being motivated, and high self-efficacy.  Conclusions: Interventions that increase awareness concerning the risks of non-adherence of AYAs with T1D are needed, that increase motivation to adhere by stressing the advantages, creating support and increasing self-efficacy, and that address action planning and goal parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Usefulness of vaccine boosters for Covid-19 in Italy and in UK and comparison between in intensive care admissions and deaths of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Surprises and implications [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is insufficient clarity about the different outcomes between unvaccinated and vaccinated people hospitalized with Covid-19, with reference to the variables “Intensive Care Unit” and “Deaths”. Moreover, it is unclear the real effectiveness of the vaccine boosters on the risks of infection and Covid-19 deaths, beyond the first few months after the booster. To verify the hypotheses that repeated vaccinations might expose to a progressively greater risk of severe Covid-19, and of a growing weakening of the immune response, primarily against infection, as the distance from the booster dose increases. Methods: Through an analysis of the official Italian data we calculated significant differences, percentage variations and trends in the variables “Intensive Care Units” and “Deaths” in hospitalized patients among four groups with different vaccination status, and between the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated groups. Through analyses of the UK Security Agency data in the weekly COVID-19 vaccine surveillance reports we explored the vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and against COVID-19 deaths in relation to the time elapsed from the booster doses. Results: Repeated vaccinations seem to expose the recipients to a growing risk of severe Covid-19, and fewer vaccinations might be enough to protect persons at greater risk. The vaccine effectiveness against infection vanished and reversed in the medium term, and vaccinated persons with three doses become increasingly more infected versus unvaccinated persons. Conclusions: The starting hypotheses have been supported, together with the need to combine carefully rethought vaccination campaigns with the implementation of other strategies, with the achievement of a healthy living and working environment, healthy lifestyles, and effective, safe and sustainable care.

                Background: Mass testing and adequate management are essential to terminate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This testing is due to the possibility of unidentified cases, especially ones without COVID-19 related symptoms. This review aimed to examine the outcome of the existing studies on the ways of identifying COVID-19 cases, and determine the populations at risk, symptom and diagnostic test management of  COVID-19. Methods: The articles reviewed were scientific publications on the PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. The keywords used to obtain the data were COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and case detection, case management or diagnostic test. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes (PICO) approaches. Results: A total of 21 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed qualitatively. However, 62% of the articles used a rapid antibody test for screening rather than a rapid antigen test. According to the rapid antigen test, 51.3% were positive, with men aged above 50 years recording the highest number of cases. Furthermore, 57.1% of patients were symptomatic, while diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity increased to 100% in 14 days after the onset. Conclusions:  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is recommended by the World Health Organization for detection of COVID-19. Suppose it is unavailable, the rapid antigen test is used as an alternative rather than the rapid antibody test. Diagnosis is expected to be confirmed using the PCR and serological assay to achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19, according to disease progression, gradual rapid tests can be used, such as rapid antigen in an earlier week and antibody tests confirmed by RT–PCR and serological assay in the second week of COVID-19.

                Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has become a method of choice for in-depth characterization of tissue heterogeneity in health and disease, and is currently implemented in multiple clinical trials, where higher quality standards must be met. Currently, preprocessing of raw files is commonly performed in independent standalone tools, which makes it difficult to reproduce. Here, we present an R pipeline based on an updated version of CATALYST that covers all preprocessing steps required for downstream mass cytometry analysis in a fully reproducible way. This new version of CATALYST is based on Bioconductor’s SingleCellExperiment class and fully unit tested. The R-based pipeline includes file concatenation, bead-based normalization, single-cell deconvolution, spillover compensation and live cell gating after debris and doublet removal. Importantly, this pipeline also includes different quality checks to assess machine sensitivity and staining performance while allowing also for batch correction. This pipeline is based on open source R packages and can be easily be adapted to different study designs. It therefore has the potential to significantly facilitate the work of CyTOF users while increasing the quality and reproducibility of data generated with this technology.

                The need for improved crop water use efficiency calls for flexible modeling platforms to implement new ideas in plant root uptake and its regulation mechanisms. This paper documents the details of modifying a soil infiltration and redistribution model to include (a) dynamic root growth, (b) non-uniform root distribution and water uptake, (c) the effect of water stress on plant water uptake, and (d) soil evaporation. The paper also demonstrates strategies of using the modified model to simulate soil water dynamics and plant transpiration considering different sensitivity of plants to soil dryness and different mechanisms of root water uptake. In particular, the flexibility of simulating various degrees of compensated uptake (whereby plants tend to maintain potential transpiration under mild water stress) is emphasized. The paper also describes how to estimate unknown root distribution and rooting depth parameters by the use of a simulation-based searching method. The full documentation of the computer code will allow further applications and new development.

                A clear understanding of the origin and role of the different subtypes of the B cell lineage involved in the activity or remission of multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for the treatment and follow-up of patients living with this disease. B cells, however, are dynamic and can play an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory role, depending on their milieu. Depletion of B cells has been effective in controlling the progression of MS, but it can have adverse side effects. A better understanding of the role of the B cell subtypes, through the use of surface biomarkers of cellular activity with special attention to the function of memory and regulatory B cells (Bregs), will be necessary in order to offer specific treatments without inducing undesirable effects.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) are reciprocally connected brain regions that play significant roles in the motor control. However, the electrophysiological relationship among the STN, SNr, and PPTg remains controversial. The present study was designed to further explore the mutual electrophysiological relationship of these brain regions from the perspective of the PPTg–STN–SNr neural circuit. The neuronal activities in the STN and SNr were simultaneously recorded while the PPTg was stimulated in anesthetized rats. The activation of PPTg induced excitatory responses of both the STN and SNr neurons. Comparisons of excitation latencies between the STN and SNr were made to distinguish the excitation evoked from the PPTg–STN–SNr pathway. Additionally, two types of excitatory responses and various inhibitory responses with different latencies in the SNr were recorded. The SNr responses could also be classified into five different response categories, which might attribute to projections within different neural circuits. Neuronal recordings were analyzed in different electrophysiological features (i.e., interspike interval [ISI] mode, ISI asymmetry index, ISI coefficient of variance, firing rate, burst index, and trough peak duration), and different response patterns of neurons had their specific features in neuronal activities. These findings indicated the complex interactions among the STN, SNr, and PPTg electrophysiologically, and provided insights into exploring information transmission mechanisms underlying these circuits.</p>

     alt="A brain atlas of the carrion crow (Corvus corone)"/>
<p>Kersten et al. present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, <i>Corvus corone</i>, a corvid songbird. Based on different staining techniques applied to brain slices and 3D reconstructions, the global organization of the crow brain is shown in stereotaxic coordinates. This atlas will help to compare avian species and guide future neurobiological studies of corvids.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvidae, passerine songbirds such as jays, crows, and ravens known as corvids, have become model systems for the study of avian cognition. The superior cognitive capabilities of corvids mainly emerge from a disproportionally large telencephalon found in these species. However, a systematic mapping of the neuroanatomy of the corvid brain, and the telencephalon in particular, is lacking so far. Here, we present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, <i>Corvus corone</i>, with special emphasis on the telencephalic pallium. We applied four staining techniques to brain slices (Nissl, myelin, combination of Nissl and myelin, and tyrosine hydroxylase targeting catecholaminergic neurons). This allowed us to identify brain nuclei throughout the brain and delineate the known pallial subdivisions termed hyperpallium, entopallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, arcopallium, and hippocampal complex. The extent of these subdivisions and brain nuclei are described according to stereotaxic coordinates. In addition, 3D depictions of pallial regions were reconstructed from these slices. While the overall organization of the carrion crow's brain matches other songbird brains, the relative proportions and expansions of associative pallial areas differ considerably in agreement with enhanced cognitive skills found in corvids. The presented global organization of the crow brain in stereotaxic coordinates will help to guide future neurobiological studies in corvids.</p>

     alt="Innovative treatments for epilepsy: Venom peptides, cannabinoids, and neurostimulation"/>
<p>This article reviews the most innovative treatments for epilepsy, given the great percentage of drug resistant patients. The topics addressed include neuromodulation, peptides derived from animal venoms, cannabinoids and nanoparticles.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs have been successfully treating epilepsy and providing individuals sustained seizure freedom. However, about 30% of the patients with epilepsy present drug resistance, which means they are not responsive to the pharmacological treatment. Considering this, it becomes extremely relevant to pursue alternative therapeutic approaches, in order to provide appropriate treatment for those patients and also improve their quality of life. In the light of that, this review aims to discuss some innovative options for the treatment of epilepsy, which are currently under investigation, addressing strategies that go from therapeutic compounds to clinical procedures. For instance, peptides derived from animal venoms, such as wasps, spiders, and scorpions, demonstrate to be promising antiepileptic molecules, acting on a variety of targets. Other options are cannabinoids and compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system, since it is now known that this network is involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Furthermore, neurostimulation is another strategy, being an alternative clinical procedure for drug-resistant patients who are not eligible for palliative surgeries.</p>

                Cummings et al. demonstrate that discrete populations of prefrontal somatostatin interneurons activated by positive and negative experience exert opposing control over fear memory. This outlines an important role for functional specialization of GABAergic interneurons in emotional learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The VINE complex is an endosomal VPS9-domain GEF and SNX-BAR coat</a></h4>

              
                Membrane trafficking pathways perform important roles in establishing and maintaining the endosomal network. Retrograde protein sorting from the endosome is promoted by conserved SNX-BAR-containing coat complexes including retromer which enrich cargo at tubular microdomains and generate transport carriers. In metazoans, retromer cooperates with VARP, a conserved VPS9-domain GEF, to direct an endosomal recycling pathway. The function of the yeast VARP homolog Vrl1 has been overlooked due to an inactivating mutation found in commonly studied strains. Here, we demonstrate that Vrl1 has features of a SNX-BAR coat protein and forms an obligate complex with Vin1, the paralog of the retromer SNX-BAR protein Vps5. Unique features in the Vin1 N-terminus allow Vrl1 to distinguish it from Vps5, thereby forming a complex that we have named VINE. The VINE complex occupies endosomal tubules and redistributes a conserved mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like protein from endosomes. We also find that membrane recruitment by Vin1 is essential for Vrl1 GEF activity, suggesting that VINE is a multifunctional coat complex that regulates trafficking and signaling events at the endosome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A pulse-chasable reporter processing assay for mammalian autophagic flux with HaloTag</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring autophagic flux is necessary for most autophagy studies. The autophagic flux assays currently available for mammalian cells are generally complicated and do not yield highly quantitative results. Yeast autophagic flux is routinely monitored with the GFP-based processing assay, whereby the amount of GFP proteolytically released from GFP-containing reporters (e.g., GFP-Atg8), detected by immunoblotting, reflects autophagic flux. However, this simple and effective assay is typically inapplicable to mammalian cells because GFP is efficiently degraded in lysosomes while the more proteolytically resistant RFP accumulates in lysosomes under basal conditions. Here, we report a HaloTag (Halo)-based reporter processing assay to monitor mammalian autophagic flux. We found that Halo is sensitive to lysosomal proteolysis but becomes resistant upon ligand binding. When delivered into lysosomes by autophagy, pulse-labeled Halo-based reporters (e.g., Halo-LC3 and Halo-GFP) are proteolytically processed to generate Halo<sup>ligand</sup> when delivered into lysosomes by autophagy. Hence, the amount of free Halo<sup>ligand</sup> detected by immunoblotting or in-gel fluorescence imaging reflects autophagic flux. We demonstrate the applications of this assay by monitoring the autophagy pathways, macroautophagy, selective autophagy, and even bulk nonselective autophagy. With the Halo-based processing assay, mammalian autophagic flux and lysosome-mediated degradation can be monitored easily and precisely.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nomograms of human hippocampal volume shifted by polygenic scores</a></h4>

              
                Nomograms are important clinical tools applied widely in both developing and aging populations. They are generally constructed as normative models identifying cases as outliers to a distribution of healthy controls. Currently used normative models do not account for genetic heterogeneity. Hippocampal Volume (HV) is a key endophenotype for many brain disorders. Here, we examine the impact of genetic adjustment on HV nomograms and the translational ability to detect dementia patients. Using imaging data from 35,686 healthy subjects aged 44 to 82 from the UK BioBank (UKB), we built HV nomograms using gaussian process regression (GPR), which - compared to a previous method - extended the application age by 20 years, including dementia critical age ranges. Using HV Polygenic Scores (HV-PGS), we built genetically adjusted nomograms from participants stratified into the top and bottom 30% of HV-PGS. This shifted the nomograms in the expected directions by ~100 mm<sup>3</sup> (2.3% of the average HV), which equates to 3 years of normal aging for a person aged ~65. Clinical impact of genetically adjusted nomograms was investigated by comparing 818 subjects from the AD neuroimaging (ADNI) database diagnosed as either cognitively normal (CN), having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease patients (AD). While no significant change in the survival analysis was found for MCI-to-AD conversion, an average of 68% relative decrease was found in intra-diagnostic-group variance, highlighting the importance of genetic adjustment in untangling phenotypic heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multistep loading of a DNA sliding clamp onto DNA by replication factor C</a></h4>

              
                The DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential co-factor for many eukaryotic DNA metabolic enzymes. PCNA is loaded around DNA by the ATP-dependent clamp loader replication factor C (RFC), which acts at single-stranded (ss)/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) junctions harboring a recessed 3’ end (3’ ss/dsDNA junctions) and at DNA nicks. To illuminate the loading mechanism we have investigated the structure of RFC:PCNA bound to ATPγS and 3’ ss/dsDNA junctions or nicked DNA using cryogenic electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, we observe open and closed PCNA conformations in the RFC:PCNA:DNA complex, revealing that PCNA can adopt an open, planar conformation that allows direct insertion of dsDNA, and raising the question of whether PCNA ring closure is mechanistically coupled to ATP hydrolysis. By resolving multiple DNA-bound states of RFC:PCNA we observe that partial melting facilitates lateral insertion into the central channel formed by RFC:PCNA. We also resolve the Rfc1 N-terminal domain and demonstrate that its single BRCT domain participates in coordinating DNA prior to insertion into the central RFC channel, which promotes PCNA loading on the lagging strand of replication forks in vitro. Combined, our data suggest a comprehensive and fundamentally revised model for the RFC-catalyzed loading of PCNA onto DNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Estimation and worldwide monitoring of the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                The effective reproductive number <i>R</i><sub>e</sub> is a key indicator of the growth of an epidemic. Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many methods and online dashboards have sprung up to monitor this number through time. However, these methods are not always thoroughly tested, correctly placed in time, or are overly confident during high incidence periods. Here, we present a method for timely estimation of <i>R<sub>e</sub></i>, applied to COVID-19 epidemic data from 170 countries. We thoroughly evaluate the method on simulated data, and present an intuitive web interface for interactive data exploration. We show that, in early 2020, in the majority of countries the estimated <i>R</i><sub>e</sub> dropped below 1 only after the introduction of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For Europe the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions was broadly associated with reductions in the estimated <i>R<sub>e</sub></i>. Globally though, relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions had more varied effects on subsequent <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> estimates. Our framework is useful to inform governments and the general public on the status of epidemics in their country, and is used as the official source of <i>R<sub>e</sub></i> estimates for SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland. It further allows detailed comparison between countries and in relation to covariates such as implemented public health policies, mobility, behaviour, or weather data.

                The transformation of normal to malignant cells is accompanied by substantial changes in gene expression programs through diverse mechanisms. Here, we examined the changes in the landscape of transcription start sites and alternative promoter (AP) usage and their impact on the translatome in TCL1-driven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our findings revealed a marked elevation of APs in CLL B cells from Eµ-Tcl1 transgenic mice, which are particularly enriched with intra-genic promoters that generate N-terminally truncated or modified proteins. Intra-genic promoter activation is mediated by (1) loss of function of ‘closed chromatin’ epigenetic regulators due to the generation of inactive N-terminally modified isoforms or reduced expression; (2) upregulation of transcription factors, including <i>c-Myc</i>, targeting the intra-genic promoters and their associated enhancers. Exogenous expression of <i>Tcl1</i> in MEFs is sufficient to induce intra-genic promoters of epigenetic regulators and promote <i>c-Myc</i> expression. We further found a dramatic translation downregulation of transcripts bearing CNY cap-proximal trinucleotides, reminiscent of cells undergoing metabolic stress. These findings uncovered the role of <i>Tcl1</i> oncogenic function in altering promoter usage and mRNA translation in leukemogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Science Forum: How failure to falsify in high-volume science contributes to the replication crisis</a></h4>

              
                The number of scientific papers published every year continues to increase, but scientific knowledge is not progressing at the same rate. Here we argue that a greater emphasis on falsification - the direct testing of strong hypotheses - would lead to faster progress by allowing well-specified hypotheses to be eliminated. We describe an example from neuroscience where there has been little work to directly test two prominent but incompatible hypotheses related to traumatic brain injury. Based on this example, we discuss how building strong hypotheses and then setting out to falsify them can bring greater precision to the clinical neurosciences, and argue that this approach could be beneficial to all areas of science.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory corticofugal neurons transmit non-auditory signals to support discriminative learning</a></h4>

              
                Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of sensory cortices project corticofugal axons to myriad of sub-cortical targets, thereby broadcasting high-level signals important for perception and learning. Recent studies suggest dendritic Ca2+ spikes as key biophysical mechanisms supporting corticofugal neuron function: These long-lasting events drive burst firing, thereby initiating uniquely powerful signals to modulate sub-cortical representations and trigger learning-related plasticity. However, the behavioral relevance of corticofugal dendritic spikes is poorly understood. We shed light on this issue using 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of auditory corticofugal dendrites as mice engage in a sound-discrimination task. Unexpectedly, only a minority of dendritic spikes were triggered by sound. Rather, task-related dendritic activity mostly occurred following sound termination and reflected instrumental actions, irrespective of reward consumption. Temporally selective silencing of this motor-related activity impaired auditory discrimination learning. Thus, corticofugal systems contribution to learning and plasticity may be largely motor, rather than sensory in nature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic activation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons induces a brain-wide response in reward network</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin is a neuromodulator that affects multiple behavioral and cognitive functions. Nonetheless, how serotonin causes such a variety of effects through its brain-wide projections and variety of receptors remains unclear. Here we measured the brain-wide response to optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by functional MRI using an 11.7T scanner with a cryoprobe. Transient activation of DRN serotonin neurons caused wide-spread activation of reward-related brain areas. The same stimulation under anesthesia with isoflurane decreased activation of those reward-related areas and the hippocampal complex. These brain-wide response patterns can be explained by DRN serotonergic projection topography and serotonin receptor expression profiles, with enhanced weights on 5-HT1 type receptors. The primarily facilitatory effect on reward-related brain areas by DRN serotonergic activation is consistent with recent discoveries of its roles in reward-oriented behaviors and demands reconsideration of inhibitory view due to the result under anesthesia.

                Different organelles traveling through neurons exhibit distinct properties in vitro, but this has not been investigated in the intact brain. We established simultaneous dual color 2-photon microscopy to visualize the trafficking of Neuropeptide Y-, LAMP1- and RAB7- tagged organelles in thalamocortical axons imaged in mouse cortex in vivo. This revealed that LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles move significantly faster than NPY tagged organelles in both anterograde and retrograde direction. NPY travelled more selectively in anterograde direction than LAMP1 and RAB7. By using a synapse marker and a calcium sensor we further investigated the transport dynamics of NPY-tagged organelles. We found that these organelles slow down and pause at synapses. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, a significant increase of transport speed was observed after spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices. Together, we show a remarkable diversity in speeds and properties of three axonal organelle marker in vivo that differ from properties previously observed in vitro.

	<p>(1) Background: ADHD is recognized as one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3%; however, estimates vary as a function of a number of factors, including diagnostic methods, age, sex and geographical location. A review of studies is needed to clarify the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada. (2) Methods: A search strategy was created in PubMed and adapted for MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Papers were included if they examined diagnosed ADHD prevalence and/or incidence rates in any region of Canada, age group and gender. A snowball technique was used to identify additional papers from reference lists, and experts in the field were consulted. (3) Results: Ten papers included in this review reported on prevalence, and one reported on incidence. One study provided an overall prevalence estimate across provinces for adults of 2.9%, and one study provided an overall estimate across five provinces for children and youth of 8.6%. Across age groups (1 to 24 years), incidence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 1.2%, depending on province. Estimates varied by age, gender, province, region and time. (4) Conclusions: The overall Canadian ADHD prevalence estimate is similar to worldwide estimates for adults. Most studies reported on prevalence rather than incidence. Differences in estimates across provinces may reflect the varying number of practitioners available to diagnose and prescribe medication for ADHD across provinces. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes all provinces and territories, and that considers estimates in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical region, socioeconomic status and access to mental healthcare coverage. Incidence rates need further examination to be determined.</p>

	<p>Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common opportunistic infections, mainly reported in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have also been linked to reactivation of toxoplasmosis due to immunosuppressive treatment, although biologic drugs have seldom been implicated. We present a case of cerebral toxoplasmosis in a 62-year-old female patient with RA after initiation of biologic therapy (adalimumab). The patient had detectable serum IgG antibodies to toxoplasma gondii, was also on chronic treatment with other non-biologic drugs and presented with worsening disorientation, unsteady gait and left hemiparesis. Imaging studies showed a space-occupying lesion in the right basal ganglia with ring-enhancement. Brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis and the patient was treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for 6 weeks, showing complete recovery on follow-up. A review of the literature yielded other four case reports of cerebral toxoplasmosis implying biologic drugs; however, data concerning toxoplasmosis serologic testing, prophylaxis and treatment in these patients are lacking. Each case must be carefully evaluated prior to treatment and a high-index of suspicion in seropositive patients is warranted. Since the use of biologic drugs is increasing, further research is needed to establish practical guidelines for seropositive patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have found a link between tinnitus and cognitive impairment, even leading to dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. The purpose of this study was to explore intrinsic network changes in tinnitus and hearing loss patients with cognitive disorders. We included 17 individuals with bilateral idiopathic tinnitus, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment (PA) and 21 healthy controls. We identified resting-state networks (RSNs) and measured intra-network functional connectivity (FC) values via independent component analysis (ICA). We also evaluated correlations between RSNs and clinical characteristics. Compared with the healthy controls, the PA group showed decreased connectivity within the ventral attention network, dorsal attention network (DAN), visual network, left frontoparietal network, right frontoparietal network, sensorimotor network, and increased connectivity within the executive control network. MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) scores were negatively correlated with the FC values for left calcarine within the DAN. We identified abnormal intrinsic connectivity in several brain networks, mainly involving cognitive control, vision, sensorimotor function, and the cerebellum, in tinnitus patients with cognitive impairment. It may be possible to use the FC strength of the left calcarine within the DAN as an imaging marker to predict cognitive impairment in tinnitus patients.</p>

	<p>Paraneoplastic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and special type of ALS. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis remain poorly understood. We herein presented three cases of paraneoplastic ALS. In case 1, we first reported an ALS patient with the positive serum antibodies against both Sry-like high mobility group box 1 (SOX1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65). However, immunotherapy did not improve his neurological symptoms. We also reported two ALS patients with renal clear cell carcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia. No positive paraneoplastic antibodies were detected in either the serum or the cerebrospinal fluid of the two patients, and their clinical symptoms progressed slowly after tumor treatment. The three cases enriched the existing case pool of this rare disorder. In addition, we have comprehensively reviewed the literature of paraneoplastic ALS. The clinical features, treatment effect and prognosis were summarized to broaden our understanding of paraneoplastic ALS.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability and suicide worldwide. Consecutive rounds of conventional interventions are ineffective in a significant sub-group of patients whose disorder is classified as treatment-resistant depression. Significant progress in managing this severe form of depression has been achieved through the use of deep brain stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The beneficial effect of such stimulation appears strong, safe, and enduring. The proposed neural substrate for this promising clinical finding includes midbrain dopamine neurons and a subset of their cortical afferents. Here, we aim to broaden the discussion of the candidate circuitry by exploring potential implications of a new &amp;amp;ldquo;convergence&amp;amp;rdquo; model of brain reward circuitry in rodents. We chart the evolution of the new model from its predecessors, which held that midbrain dopamine neurons constituted an obligatory stage of the final common path for reward seeking. In contrast, the new model includes a directly activated, non-dopaminergic pathway whose output ultimately converges with that of the dopaminergic neurons. On the basis of the new model and the relative ineffectiveness of dopamine agonists in the treatment of depression, we ask whether non-dopaminergic circuitry may contribute to the clinical efficacy of deep brain stimulation of the MFB.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robin's Viewer: Using Deep-Learning Predictions to Assist EEG Annotation</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning has been successfully applied to EEG data for sleep staging, epileptic seizure detection, and artifact recognition. However, the performance of automated annotation is not yet sufficient to replace trained annotators in a clinical setting. Therefore, we propose a decision-support-system to help human annotators work faster and more effectively. As a first step towards addressing these challenges, we developed Robins Viewer (RV) in Python, building on top of the plotting library Plotly and the popular M/EEG analysis toolbox MNE. The goal was to create a platform-independent, interactive web app, which is open-source and supports many common EEG-file formats to facilitate easy integration with a variety of EEG toolboxes. RV includes many common features of other EEG viewers, e.g., a view-slider, marking of bad channels and transient artifacts, and customizable preprocessing. The key feature distinguishing RV from existing EEG viewers is the possibility to visualize output predictions of deep-learning models that are trained to recognize patterns in EEG data. The result is a decision-support-system for scientists and clinicians who can use RV to annotate artifacts, sleep stages, abnormalities, and other classification tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pupil dynamics-derived sleep stage classification of a head-fixed mouse using a recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                The standard method for sleep state classification is thresholding amplitudes of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), followed by an experts manual correction. Although popular, the method entails some shortcomings: 1) the time-consuming manual correction by human experts is sometimes a bottleneck hindering sleep studies; 2) EEG electrodes on the skull interfere with wide-field imaging of the cortical activity of a head-fixed mouse under a microscope; 3) invasive surgery to fix the electrodes on the thin skull of a mouse risks brain tissue injury; and 4) metal electrodes for EEG and EMG are difficult to apply to some experiment apparatus such as that for functional magnetic resonance imaging. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a pupil dynamics-based vigilance state classification for a head-fixed mouse using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a variant of recurrent neural networks, for multi-class labeling of NREM, REM, and WAKE states. For supervisory hypnography, EEG and EMG recording were performed for a head-fixed mouse, combined with left eye pupillometry using a USB camera and a markerless tracking toolbox, DeepLabCut. Our open-source LSTM model with feature inputs of pupil diameter, location, velocity, and eyelid opening for 10 s at a 10 Hz sampling rate achieved vigilance state estimation with a higher classification performance (macro F1 score, 0.77; accuracy, 86%) than a feed forward neural network. Findings from diverse pupillary dynamics implied subdivision of a vigilance state defined by EEG and EMG. Pupil dynamics-based hypnography can expand the scope of alternatives for sleep stage scoring of head fixed mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiphoton holographic photostimulation induces potassium-dependent spike silencing in label-free mouse cortex in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Multiphoton microscopy allows measurement of network activity as well as the manipulation of cell type specific or functionally identified neuronal subpopulations with optogenetic holographic stimulation. When neurons co-express an activity reporter (e.g. calcium or voltage-sensitive indicators) and an (excitatory or inhibitory) opsin, such "all optical" interrogation approaches in vivo allows to draw causal links between function of cell-type specific microcircuits and behaviour. However, the net effects of near-infrared stimulation on network activity per se remain to be adequately investigated in vivo. Here we show that multicell holographic photostimulation with near-infrared radiation with total powers to sample used in current literature halves the spike rate of the non-illuminated neurons in label-free mouse cortex in vivo. The effect is not mediated by GABA release, but depends on NIR-dependent gating of potassium channels as it is absent when neurons are intracellularly perfused with the broad potassium channel blocker cesium ions, and are possibly mediated by heating. The phenomenon may contribute to set an upper limit to holographic photostimulation efficacy, calls for the need to control the effects of holographic stimulation protocols per se in label free preparations, and might be of relevance to interpret the therapeutical effects on infrared stimulation in psychiatry and neurology.

Highlights- Holographic multi-cell, infrared illumination halves spike rates of no-target neurons
- The effect happens with total powers to sample used in "all-optical" literature
- Infrared-driven spike killing is GABA-independent but depends on potassium channels

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">circAβ RNA drives the formation and deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                {beta}-amyloid peptides (A{beta}) play key causal role in Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the mechanisms of A{beta} biogenesis in sporadic AD are still largely unknown. Moreover, current AD mouse models which overexpress mutated human APP and presenilin proteins can only mimic limited characteristics of familial AD. We recently discovered an alternative A{beta} production pathway from A{beta}175, an A{beta} peptide containing polypeptide translated from circular circA{beta}-a RNA generated via backsplicing of the APP gene transcript. Here, wildtype human circA{beta}-a RNA was overexpressed in wildtype mouse frontal cortex. Results showed that circA{beta}-a overexpression drove intracellular A{beta} accumulation and extensive depositions of neuronal A{beta} plaques in mouse brain in vivo. This recapitulates the critical A{beta} hallmarks of sporadic AD and represents a sporadic AD mouse model. In summary, the causal relationship between circA{beta} RNA overexpression and AD pathology was demonstrated. This novel AD mouse model will accelerate disease-modifying drug development of this detrimental neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Object representation in a gravitational reference frame</a></h4>

              
                When your head tilts laterally, as in sports, reaching, and resting, your eyes counterrotate less than 20%, and thus eye images rotate, over a total range of about 180{degrees}. Yet, the world appears stable and vision remains normal. We discovered a neural strategy for rotational stability in anterior inferotemporal cortex (IT), the final stage of object vision in primates. We measured object orientation tuning of IT neurons in macaque monkeys tilted +25 and -25{degrees} laterally, producing [~]40{degrees} difference in retinal image orientation. Among IT neurons with consistent object orientation tuning, 63% remained stable with respect to gravity across tilts. Gravitational tuning depended on vestibular/somatosensory but also visual cues, consistent with previous evidence that IT processes scene cues for gravitys orientation. In addition to stability across image rotations, an internal gravitational reference frame is important for physical understanding of a world where object position, posture, structure, shape, movement, and behavior interact critically with gravity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different modality-specific mechanisms mediate perceptual history effects in vision and audition</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual history plays an important role in sensory processing and decision making, shaping how we perceive and judge external objects and events. Indeed, past stimuli can bias what we are currently seeing in an attractive fashion, making a current stimulus to appear more similar to its preceding one than it actually is. Such attractive effects across successive stimuli appear to be ubiquitous, affecting almost every aspect of perception - from very basic visual attributes (i.e., orientation) to more complex features (i.e., face identity) - suggesting that they may reflect a fundamental principle of brain processing. However, it is unclear whether the ubiquitous nature of these effects is due to an underlying centralised mechanism mediating all of them, or by the existence of separate mechanisms implemented independently in different perceptual pathways. Here we address this question by assessing the behavioural and neural signature of perceptual history in audition and vision, in the context of time perception. Our results first show a double dissociation between the two modalities, whereby the behavioural effect of perceptual history shows opposite patterns of selectivity for the features and position of the stimuli. Electroencephalography results further support a difference between audition and vision, demonstrating that the signature of perceptual history unfolds according to different dynamics in the two modalities and show different relations with the behavioural effect. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of perceptual history may be mediated by different and at least partially independent mechanisms based on the same computational principle, implemented in different sensory pathways.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe recent history of stimulation, or perceptual history, plays a fundamental role in perception, shaping what we see according to what we saw in the past. The brain mechanisms mediating the integration of past and present perceptual information are however still unclear. In this study we asked whether perceptual history operates via a centralized mechanism shared across sensory modalities, or via distinct modality-specific mechanisms. Our findings show a double dissociation in attractive perceptual history effects across vision and audition, while EEG data show neural signatures of perceptual history with distinct dynamics and properties. Overall, we thus demonstrate that perceptual history affects sensory processing starting from the earliest level of processing, within distinct modality-specific sensory pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No Free Lunch from Deep Learning in Neuroscience: A Case Study through Models of the Entorhinal-Hippocampal Circuit</a></h4>

              
                Research in Neuroscience, as in many scientific disciplines, is undergoing a renaissance based on deep learning. Unique to Neuroscience, deep learning models can be used not only as a tool but interpreted as models of the brain. The central claims of recent deep learning-based models of brain circuits are that they make novel predictions about neural phenomena or shed light on the fundamental functions being optimized. We show, through the case-study of grid cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, that one may get neither. We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from first-principles modeling efforts, then rigorously examine the claims of deep learning models of grid cells. Using large-scale hyperparameter sweeps and theory-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may be more strongly driven by particular, non-fundamental, and post-hoc implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize. We discuss why these models cannot be expected to produce accurate models of the brain without the addition of substantial amounts of inductive bias, an informal No Free Lunch result for Neuroscience. Based on first principles work, we provide hypotheses for what additional loss functions will produce grid cells more robustly. In conclusion, caution and consideration, together with biological knowledge, are warranted in building and interpreting deep learning models in Neuroscience.

	<p>Background and Purpose: Recent population-based studies from the US and UK have identified an increase in the occurrence of Guillain&amp;amp;ndash;Barr&amp;amp;eacute; syndrome (GBS) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. However, the localized variant of GBS might be underestimated due to its rarity and atypical features. We aimed to identify and characterize bilateral facial weakness with distal paresthesia (BFWdp) as a GBS variant following COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Relevant studies published during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched and identified in the MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. Results: This review found that 18 BFWdp cases presented characteristics similar to previous BFWdp cases as defined in the literature: male dominance, frequent albuminocytological dissociation, and acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy pattern. In contrast, facial nerve enhancement on brain MRI and antiganglioside antibody positivity were often observed in BFWdp following COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: The mechanism of BFWdp following COVID-19 vaccination appears to be somewhat different from that of sporadic BFWdp. Neurological syndromes with rare incidence and difficulty in diagnosis should be considered adverse events of COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

	<p>This study developed a predictive model for cognitive degeneration in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) using a machine learning method. The clinical data, plasma biomarkers, and neuropsychological test results of patients with PD were collected and utilized as model predictors. Machine learning methods comprising support vector machines (SVMs) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to obtain a cognitive classification model. Using 32 comprehensive predictive parameters, the PCA-SVM classifier reached 92.3% accuracy and 0.929 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the accuracy could be increased to 100% and the AUC to 1.0 in a PCA-SVM model using only 13 carefully chosen features.</p>

	<p>We investigated the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and final diagnosis of patients with acute isolated or prominent dysarthria who visited the emergency department (ED) between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021. Of 2028 patients aged &amp;amp;ge; 18 years with neurologic symptoms treated by a neuro-emergency expert, 75 with acute isolated or predominant dysarthria within 1 week were enrolled. Patients were categorized as having isolated dysarthria (n = 28, 37.3%) and prominent dysarthria (n = 47, 62.7%). The causes of stroke were acute ischemic stroke (AIS) (n = 37, 49.3%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (n = 14, 18.7%), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 1, 1.3%), and non-stroke causes (n = 23, 30.7%). The most common additional symptoms were gait disturbance or imbalance (n = 8, 15.4%) and dizziness (n = 3, 13.0%) in the stroke and non-stroke groups, respectively. The isolated dysarthria group had a higher rate of TIA (n = 7, 38.9%), single and small lesions (n = 10, 83.3%), and small-vessel occlusion in Trial of Org 101072 in acute stroke treatment (n = 8, 66.7%). Acute isolated or prominent dysarthria in the ED mostly presented as clinical symptoms of AIS, but other non-stroke and medical causes were not uncommon. In acute dysarthria with ischemic stroke, multiple territorial and small and single lesions are considered a cause.</p>

                Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion plays a crucial role not only in presynaptic vesicle exocytosis but also in postsynaptic receptor delivery. The latter is considered particularly important for long-term synaptic plasticity and learning and memory, yet underlying mechanisms including the identity of the key SNARE proteins remain elusive. Here, we investigate the role of neuronal Synaptosomal-Associated Protein-23 (SNAP-23) by analyzing pyramidal-neuron specific SNAP-23 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. SNAP-23 immunostaining in postsynaptic spines was effectively decreased in the SNAP-23 cKO hippocampus. Electrophysiological analysis of SNAP-23 deficient neurons using acute hippocampal slices showed normal basal neurotransmission in CA3-CA1 synapses with unchanged AMPA and NMDA currents. Nevertheless, we found theta-burst stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was vastly diminished in SNAP-23 cKO. Moreover, unlike syntaxin-4 cKO mice in which both basal neurotransmission and LTP decrease manifested changes in a broad set of behavioral tasks, deficits of SNAP-23 cKO is more limited to spatial memory. Our data reveal that neuronal SNAP-23 is selectively crucial for synaptic plasticity and spatial memory without affecting basal glutamate receptor function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards Detailed Cortical Maps of the Human Back with Representational Similarity Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cortical reorganization and its potential pathological significance is increasingly studied in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Yet, detailed cortical maps of the healthy human back are lacking. To better understand cortical changes during the development and maintenance of CLBP, a detailed baseline characterization resulting from sensory thoracolumbar afferent input is needed. To this end, a novel pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation method was used to stimulate paraspinal sensory afferents while studying their cortical representations in unprecedented detail. Methods: In 30 young healthy participants, vibrotactile stimulations at 20Hz and 80Hz were applied bilaterally at nine locations along the thoracolumbar axis while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. A whole-brain searchlight representational similarity analysis (RSA) in combination with different experimental models of paraspinal afferent input was used to investigate the representational organization of the respective neuronal activation patterns. Results: For 80Hz, the organizational structure of the neuronal activation patterns yielded the best fit for a model based on segmental distances between the stimulated paraspinal locations, located bilaterally in the primary (S1) and secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. For 20Hz, this observation was restricted to the right S1. Conclusions: fMRI during paraspinal vibrotactile stimulation in combination with RSA is a powerful tool that can be used to establish highly detailed cortical maps of the human back. The current findings constitute a promising basis to further explore cortical reorganization and its potential pathological meaning in CLBP patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Greater resistance to footshock punishment in female C57BL/6J mice responding for ethanol</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundOne characteristic of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is compulsive drinking, or drinking despite negative consequences. When quinine is used to model such aversion-resistant drinking, female rodents typically are more resistant to punishment than males. Using an operant response task where C57BL/6J responded for ethanol (EtOH) mixed with quinine, we previously demonstrated that female mice tolerate higher concentrations of quinine in EtOH than males. Here, we aimed to determine if this female vulnerability to aversion-resistant drinking behavior is similarly observed when footshock punishment is used.

MethodsMale and female C57BL/6J mice were trained to respond for 10% EtOH in an operant task on a fixed ratio 3 schedule. After consistent responding, mice were tested in a punishment session using either a 0.25 mA or 0.35 mA footshock. To assess footshock sensitivity, a subset of mice underwent a flinch, jump, vocalize test in which behavioral responses to increasing amplitudes of footshock (0.05 - 0.95 mA) were assessed. In a separate cohort of mice, males and females were trained to respond for 2.5% sucrose and responses were punished using a 0.25 mA footshock.

ResultsMales and females continued to respond for 10% EtOH when paired with a 0.25 mA footshock. Females alone continued to respond for EtOH when a 0.35 mA footshock was delivered. Both males and females reduced responding for 2.5% sucrose when punished with a 0.25 mA footshock. Finally, footshock sensitivity in the flinch, jump, vocalize test did not differ by sex.

ConclusionsFemales continue to respond for 10% EtOH despite a 0.35 mA footshock and this behavior is not due to differences in footshock sensitivity between males and females. These results suggest that female C57BL/6J mice are generally more resistant to punishment in an operant self-administration paradigm. These results add to the literature characterizing aversion-resistant alcohol drinking behaviors in females.

                Complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by poor dim light vision, myopia, and nystagmus, that is caused by mutations in genes critical for signal transmission between photoreceptors and depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). One such gene, LRIT3, is required for assembly of the post-synaptic signaling complex (signalplex) at the dendritic tips of DBCs, although the number of signalplex components impacted is greater in cone DBCs than in rod bipolar cells. This difference raises the possibility that LRIT3 is expressed both pre- and post-synaptically at cone terminals. Here we show that rAAV-mediated expression of LRIT3 in cones results in robust rescue of cone DBC signalplex components and restores downstream visual function, as measured by the light adapted ERG b-wave and electrophysiological recordings of BCs and RGCs. These data show that LRIT3 successfully restores function to cone DBCs in a trans-synaptic manner, potentially paving the way for therapeutic intervention in LRIT3-associated cCSNB.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular underpinnings of programming by early-life stress and the protective effects of early dietary ω6/ω3 ratio, basally and in response to LPS: hippocampal mRNA-miRNAs integrated approach</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) exposure increases the risk for mental disorders, including cognitive impairments later in life. We have previously demonstrated that a dietary low {omega}6/{omega}3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio protects against ELS-induced cognitive impairments. Several studies have implicated the neuroimmune system in the ELS and diet mediated effects, but currently the molecular pathways via which ELS and early diet exert their long-term impact are not yet fully understood. Here we study the effects of ELS and dietary PUFA ratio on hippocampal mRNA and miRNA expression in adulthood, both under basal and inflammatory conditions.

Male mice were exposed to chronic ELS by the limiting bedding and nesting material paradigm from postnatal day(P)2 to P9, and provided with a diet containing a high (15:1.1) or low (1.1:1) {omega}6 linoleic acid to {omega}3 alpha-linolenic acid ratio from P2 to P42. At P120, memory was assessed using the object location task. Subsequently, a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection was given and 24 hours later hippocampal genome-wide mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression was measured using microarray.

An integrated miRNA - mRNA analysis revealed that ELS and early diet induced miRNA driven mRNA expression changes into adulthood. Under basal conditions both ELS and the diet affected molecular pathways related to hippocampal plasticity, with a low {omega}6/{omega}3 ratio diet specific activation of molecular pathways associated with improved hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory in mice previously exposed to ELS (e.g., CREB signaling and endocannabinoid neuronal synapse pathway). LPS induced miRNA and mRNA expression was strongly influenced by both ELS and early diet. In mice fed the high {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS increased miRNA expression leading to activation of inflammatory pathways. In contrast, in mice fed the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet, LPS reduced miRNA expression and altered target mRNA expression ultimately leading to limited activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and inhibition of pathways associated with hippocampal plasticity which was especially apparent in mice previously exposed to ELS.

This data provides molecular insights into how the low {omega}6/{omega}3 diet during development could exert its long-lasting beneficial effects on hippocampal plasticity and learning and memory especially in a vulnerable population exposed to stress early in life, providing the basis for the development of intervention strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia and astrocytes differentially endocytose exosomes facilitating alpha-Synuclein endolysosomal sorting</a></h4>

              
                Exosomes have emerged as key players in cell-to-cell communication in both physiological and pathological processes in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Thus far, the intracellular pathways involved in uptake and trafficking of exosomes within different cell types of the brain (microglia and astrocytes) are poorly understood. In our study, the endocytic processes and subcellular sorting of exosomes were investigated in primary glial cells, particularly linked with the exosome-associated -synuclein (-syn) transmission. Mouse microglia and astrocytic primary cultures were incubated with DiI-stained mouse brain-derived exosomes. The internalization and trafficking pathways were analysed in cells treated with pharmacological reagents that block the major endocytic pathways. Brain-derived exosomes were internalized by both glial cell types; however, uptake was more efficient in microglia than in astrocytes. Colocalization of exosomes with early and late endocytic markers (Rab5, Lamp1) indicated that exosomes are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Treatment with Cytochalasin D, that blocks actin-dependent phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis, inhibited exosome entry into glial cells, whereas treatment with inhibitors that strip off cholesterol from the plasma membrane, induced uptake, however differentially altered endosomal sorting. Exosome-associated fibrillar -Syn was efficiently internalized and detected in Rab5- and Lamp1-positive compartments within microglia. Our study strongly suggests that exosomes enter glial cells through an actin network-dependent endocytic pathway and are sorted to endolysosomes for subsequent processing. Further, brain-derived exosomes are capable of mediating cell-to-glia transmission of pathological -Syn that is also targeted to the endosomal pathway, suggesting a possible beneficial role in microglia-mediated clearance of toxic protein aggregates, present in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics and mechanisms of ERK activation after different protocols that induce long-term facilitation in Aplysia</a></h4>

              
                The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a key kinase involved in the induction of long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse. Therefore, elucidating the dynamics of ERK activation after LTF-inducing protocols is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal and synaptic plasticity. ERK activation has rich dynamic features. After a single stimulus, activation peaks 45-minute later and declines rapidly, but after two stimuli spaced 45 min apart, activation persists (Kopec et al. 2015). However, little is known about possible changes in ERK activation for periods beyond 3 h. Given its key role in long-term learning, understanding the dynamics of ERK at 3 h and beyond might provide insights into new protocols that could enhance memory retention. Three different protocols that induce LTF were used to probe the dynamics of ERK activation. The first, termed the Standard protocol, consists of five 5-min pulses of serotonin (5-HT) with regular interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 20 min. The second, termed the Enhanced protocol, consists of five pulses of 5-HT with irregular ISIs identified with the use of computer simulations. This protocol induces greater and longer-lasting LTF than the Standard protocol. A third protocol, termed the two-pulse protocol, consists of just two 5-min pulses of 5-HT with an ISI of 45 min. Immunofluorescence revealed complex patterns of ERK activation up to 24 h after 5-HT treatment. The Standard and two-pulse protocols led to an immediate increase in active, phosphorylated ERK (pERK), which decayed within 5 h post treatment. A second wave of increased pERK was detected at 18 h post treatment. This late phase was blocked by RpcAMP (an inhibitor of protein kinase A), and by TrkB Fc and TGF-{beta} RII F antagonists. The latter two are chimeras that act via receptor sequestration. These results suggest that complex interactions among kinase pathways and growth factor cascades contribute to the late increase of ERK activity after different LTF-inducing protocols. Interestingly, ERK activity returned to basal levels 24 h after the Standard or two-pulse protocol, but remained elevated 24 h after the Enhanced protocol. This finding may help explain, in part, why the Enhanced protocol is superior to the Standard protocol in inducing long-lasting LTF.

                Value-based decision-making involves multiple cortical and subcortical brain areas, but the exact nature of neural activity underlying choice behavior has been difficult to parse out in the human brain. Here, we use intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients to decode trial-by-trial choice, showing that information related to expressed choices is contained in high frequency bands (gamma, high frequency activity) and is distributed across multiple brain regions, suggesting that distributed processes underlie human decisions under uncertainty. Furthermore, our results show that reward-based choices can be robustly decoded on a trial-by-trial basis from anatomically distributed iEEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical Learning Emerges from Temporally Preparing What Action to Perform Where</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning is the ability to exploit regularities of our world to predict what will happen when. Recently, we developed the Whac-A-Mole (WAM) paradigm to study whether participants can capitalize upon regularities embedded in complex temporal structures. Although participants were unaware of any regularity in WAM, we found better performance for targets with regular versus irregular intervals. Under the framework of statistical learning, this performance benefit can be understood to arise from distilling these regular intervals and predicting regular target onsets in a manner impossible for irregular targets. Intriguingly, here we instead found that this performance benefit emerges from preparation to a range of other temporal properties that we initially considered to be random. Participants temporally prepared, in parallel, for different actions to perform and locations to attend, without evidence that regular targets were responded to differently than irregular ones. With more time to prepare, participants gave faster and more accurate responses. Using a recent model of temporal preparation, fMTP, we illustrate that such complex temporal adaptation can arise from the memory processes underlying temporal preparation. In a broader sense, our results closely relate to theoretical work showing that statistical learning can emerge from general memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute IL-6 exposure triggers canonical IL-6R signalling in hiPSC microglia, but not neural progenitor cells.</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundExposure to elevated interleukin (IL)-6 levels in utero is consistently associated with increased risk for psychiatric disorders with a putative neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum condition (ASC). Although rodent models provide causal evidence for this association, we lack a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in human model systems. To close this gap, we characterised the response of hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (MGL) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to IL-6 in monoculture.

ResultsWe observed that human forebrain NPCs did not respond to acute IL-6 exposure in monoculture at both a protein and transcript level due to the absence of IL-6Ra expression and sIL-6Ra secretion. By contrast, acute IL-6 exposure resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation and increased IL-6, JMJD3 and IL-10 expression in MGL, confirming activation of canonical IL-6R signalling. Bulk RNAseq identified 156 upregulated genes (FDR <0.05) in MGL following acute IL-6 exposure, including IRF8, REL, HSPA1A/B and OXTR, which significantly overlapped with an upregulated gene set from post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with schizophrenia. Acute IL-6 stimulation significantly increased MGL motility suggestive of a gain of surveillance function, consistent with gene ontology pathways highlighted from the RNAseq data. Finally, MGLs displayed elevated CCL1, CXCL1, MIP-1A/B, IL-8, IL-13, IL-16, IL-18, MIF and Serpin-E1 secretion post 3h and 24h IL-6 exposure.

ConclusionOur data provide evidence for cell specific effects of acute IL-6 exposure in a human model system and strongly suggest microglia-NPC co-culture models are required to study how IL-6 influences human cortical neural progenitor cell development in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Persistent effects of acute trauma on Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer</a></h4>

              
                In humans, an acutely traumatic experience can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is often characterized by changes in anxiety and motivation months after trauma. There are few demonstrations of the persistent motivational effects of an acute stressor in rodent approaches to PTSD. In two experiments, we evaluated the persistent effects of a battery of footshocks in one context on appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, instrumental learning, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) in a different context. A battery of footshocks before appetitive training caused deficits in single-outcome PIT in male Long Evans rats. The same battery of footshocks after appetitive training, but before testing had little effect on single-outcome PIT, but there were some qualitative deficits. Although males showed more generalized fear from the aversive to the appetitive context compared to females, there were no effects of shock on sensory-specific PIT in male or female rats. In general females showed less evidence for sensory-specific PIT compared to males, who showed robust sensory-specific PIT, with clear extinction and spontaneous recovery of the sensory-specific PIT effect across test sessions. These findings show that (a) an acute trauma can have persistent effects on general motivational processes and (b) sensory-specific PIT is a useful approach for exploring sex differences in strategies for instrumental learning. We discuss implications for current approaches to stress and motivation in preclinical and clinical studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Psychometric and subcortical neurometric measures of temporal discrimination in rhesus macaques</a></h4>

              
                Temporal envelope fluctuations are abundant in nature and are critical for perception of complex sounds. While psychophysical sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) processing studies have characterized the perception of SAM, and neurophysiological studies report a subcortical transformation from temporal to rate-based code, no studies have characterized this transformation in unanesthetized animals or in nonhuman primates. To address this, we recorded single-unit responses and compared derived neurometric measures in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC) to psychometric measures of modulation frequency (MF) discrimination in macaques. IC and CN neurons often exhibited tuned responses to SAM in their rate and spike-timing. Neurometric thresholds spanned a large range (2-200 Hz {Delta} MF). The lowest 40% of IC thresholds were less than or equal to psychometric thresholds, regardless of which code was used, while CN thresholds were greater than psychometric thresholds. Discrimination at 10-20 Hz could be explained by indiscriminately pooling 30 units in either structure, while discrimination at higher MFs was best explained by more selective pooling. This suggests that pooled brainstem activity was sufficient for AM discrimination. Psychometric and neurometric thresholds decreased as a function of stimulus duration, but IC and CN thresholds were greater and more variable than behavior at durations less than 500 ms. This slower subcortical temporal integration compared to behavior was consistent with a drift diffusion model which reproduced individual differences in performance and can constrain future neurophysiological studies of temporal integration. These measures provide an account of AM perception at the neurophysiological, computational, and behavioral levels.

Significance statementListening in everyday environments tasks the brain with extracting information from sound envelopes. This process involves both sensory encoding and decision-making. Different neural codes for envelope representation have been well characterized in the auditory midbrain and cortex, but studies of the brainstem have usually been conducted in anesthetized rodents or cats. Moreover, these candidate neural codes have been studied in isolation from the decision-making process. In this study, we found that population activity in the primate subcortical auditory system contains sufficient information for discriminating sound envelope and applied a biologically plausible model of decision-making to sound envelope discrimination performance from rhesus macaques, a species with great phylogenetic and perceptual similarity to humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluation of an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-binding PET ligands</a></h4>

              
                Development of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that bind with high-affinity to 4{beta}2-type nicotinic receptors (4{beta}2Rs) allows for in vivo investigations of the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. One challenge associated with preclinical PET imaging involves the lack of true tissue reference regions free of specific tracer binding in the rodent brain, impeding accurate quantification of the tracer binding potential. Here, we investigate the use of an image-derived arterial input function for kinetic analysis of radiotracer binding in male and female mice. Two radiotracers were explored in this study: 2-[18F]FA85380 (2-FA), which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix), and [18F]Nifene, which displays similar pKa and binding affinity to nicotine. For both radiotracers, time-activity curves of the left ventricle of the heart displayed similar standardized uptake values (SUVs) across wild type mice, mice lacking the {beta}2 subunit for tracer binding, and acute nicotine-treated mice, whereas typical reference tissue SUVs displayed high variation between groups. Binding potential values estimated from a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) fit of the data with the image-derived input function were significantly higher than estimates from reference tissue-based estimations. Rate constants of radiotracer dissociation were very slow for 2-FA and very fast for Nifene, similar to the in vitro dissociation rates reported for varenicline and nicotine, respectively. We conclude that use of an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic PET ligands improves quantification compared to reference tissue-based methods, and that the chemical properties of 2-FA and Nifene are suitable to study receptor response to nicotine addiction and smoking cessation therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Culture of human nasal olfactory stem cells and their extracellular vesicles as advanced therapy medicinal products</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cell (OE-MSC) are mesenchymal stem cells originating from the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa. They have neurogenic and immune-modulatory properties and showed therapeutic potential in animal models of spinal cord trauma, hearing loss, Parkinsonss disease, amnesia, and peripheral nerve injury.

In this paper we designed a protocol that meet the requirements set by human health agencies to manufacture these stem cells for clinical applications.

Once purified, OE-MSCs can be used per se or expanded in order to get the extracellular vesicles (EV) they secrete. A protocol for the extraction of these vesicles was validated and the EV from the OE-MSC were functionally tested on an in vitro model.

Nasal mucosa biopsies from three donors were used to validate the manufacturing process of clinical grade OE-MSC. All stages were performed by expert staff of the cell therapy laboratory according to aseptic handling manipulations, requiring grade A laminar airflow. Enzymatic digestion provides more rapidly a high number of cells and is less likely to be contaminated. Foetal calf serum was replaced with human platelet lysate and allowed stronger cell proliferation, with the optimal percentage of platelet lysate being 10%. Cultivated OE-MSCs are sterile, highly proliferative (percentage of CFU-F progenitors was 15,5%) and their maintenance does not induce chromosomal rearrangement (karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis were normal). These cells express the usual phenotypic markers of OE-MSC. Purification of the EVs was performed with ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Purified vesicles expressed the recognized markers of EVs (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles ("MISEV") guidelines) and promoted cell differentiation and neurite elongation in a model of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line.

We developed a safer and more efficient manufacturing process for clinical-grade olfactory stem cells, these cells can now be used in humans. A phase I clinical trial will begin soon.An efficient protocol for the purification of the OE-MSC EVs have been validated. These EVs exert neurogenic properties in vitro. More studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms of action of these EVs and prove their efficacy and safety in animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tensorial Independent Component Analysis Reveals Social and Reward Networks Associated with Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. Yet, typical analyses of functional connectivity, such as spatial ICA for resting-state data, often ignore sources of between-subject variability, which may be crucial for identifying functional connectivity patterns associated with MDD. Typically, methods like spatial ICA will identify a single component to represent a network like the default mode network (DMN), even if groups within the data show differential DMN coactivation. To address this gap, this project applies a tensorial extension of ICA (tensorial ICA)--which explicitly incorporates between-subject variability--to identify functionally connected networks using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Data from the HCP included individuals with a diagnosis of MDD, a family history of MDD, and healthy controls performing a gambling and social cognition task. Based on evidence associating MDD with blunted neural activation to rewards and social stimuli, we predicted that tensorial ICA would identify networks associated with reduced spatio-temporal coherence and blunted social and reward-based network activity in MDD. Across both tasks, tensorial ICA identified three networks showing decreased coherence in MDD. All three networks included ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and cerebellum and showed different activation across the conditions of their respective tasks. However, MDD was only associated with differences in task-based activation in one network from the social task. Additionally, these results suggest that tensorial ICA could be a valuable tool for understanding clinical differences in relation to network activation and connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Naturalistic language comprehension is supported by alpha and beta oscillations linked to domain-general inhibition and reactivation</a></h4>

              
                Brain oscillations are prevalent in all species and are involved in numerous perceptual operations. Alpha oscillations are thought to facilitate processing through the inhibition of task-irrelevant networks, while beta oscillations are linked to the reactivation of content representations. Can the proposed functional role of alpha and beta oscillations be generalized from low-level operations to higher-level cognitive processes? Here we address this question focusing on naturalistic spoken language processing. Twenty-two (18 female) Dutch native speakers listened to stories in spoken Dutch and French while magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. We used dependency parsing to identify three dependency states at each word, as the number of (1) newly opened dependencies, (2) dependencies that remained open, and (3) resolved dependencies. We then constructed linear forward models to predict alpha and beta power from the dependency features. Results showed that dependency features predict alpha and beta power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features. Left temporal, fundamental language regions are involved in language comprehension in the alpha band, while frontal and parietal, higher-order language regions, and motor regions are mostly involved in the beta band. Critically, alpha and beta band dynamics seem to subserve language comprehension tapping into syntactic structure building and semantic composition by providing low-level mechanistic operations for inhibition and reactivation processes. Overall, this study sheds light on the role of alpha and beta oscillations during naturalistic language processing, providing evidence for the generalizability of these dynamics from perceptual to complex linguistic processes.

Significance StatementPrior research identified the functional role of alpha and beta oscillations in basic perceptual and motor functions. However, it remains unclear whether their proposed role can be generalized to higher-level processes during language comprehension. Here, we found that high-level syntactic features predict alpha and beta power in language-related regions beyond low-level linguistic features when listening to comprehensible naturalistic speech. Our work contributes to the debate about whether the functional roles of brain oscillations are domain-general or depend on the task at hand. We offer experimental findings that integrate a neuroscientific framework on the role of brain oscillations as "building blocks" with language comprehension as a compositional process, and novel evidence regarding the encoding of higher-level syntactic operations in the brain. This supports the view of a domain-general role of cortical oscillations across the hierarchy of cognitive functions, from low-level sensory operations to complex linguistic processes.

                Non-human primates have an important translational value given their close phylogenetic relationship to humans. Studies in these animals remain essential for evaluating efficacy and safety of new therapeutic approaches, particularly in aging primates that display Alzheimers disease (AD) -like pathology. With the objective to improve amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) targeting immunotherapy, we investigated the safety and efficacy of an active immunisation with an A{beta} derivative, K6A{beta}1-30-NH2, in old non-human primates. Thirty-two aged (4-10 year-old) mouse lemurs were enrolled in the study, and received up to four subcutaneous injections of the vaccine in alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone.

Even though antibody titres to A{beta} were not high, pathological examination of the mouse lemur brains showed significant reduction in intracellular A{beta} without inflammatory or haemorrhagic changes. Moreover, a trend for cognitive improvement was observed in the vaccinated primates, which was probably linked to A{beta} clearance. This A{beta} derivative vaccine appeared to be safe as a prophylactic measure based on the brain analyses and because it did not appear to have detrimental effects on the general health of these old animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel transient cell clusters provide a possible link between early neural activity and angiogenesis in the neonatal mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Developing neurons become spontaneously active while growing blood vessels begin to irrigate their surroundings. However, surprising little is known about early interactions between neural activity and angiogenesis. In the neonatal mouse retina, spontaneous waves of impulses sweep across the ganglion cell layer (GCL), just underneath the growing superficial vascular plexus. We discovered clusters of transient auto-fluorescent cells in the GCL, forming an annulus that co-localizes with the frontline of the growing plexus. Blood vessel density is highest within cluster areas, suggesting their involvement in angiogenesis. Once the clusters and blood vessels reach the retinal periphery by the end of the first postnatal week, the clusters disappear, eliminated by microglial phagocytosis. Electrical imaging suggests that they have their own electrophysiological signature. Blocking Pannexin1 (PANX1) hemi-channels with probenecid blocks the waves and the fluorescent clusters disappear following prolonged exposure to the drug. Spontaneous waves initiation points follow a developmental center-to-periphery progression similar to the cluster cells. We suggest that these transient cells are specialized, hyperactive neurons residing in the GCL. They generate spontaneous activity hotspots, thereby triggering waves through purinergic paracrine signaling via PANX1 hemi-channels. The strong activity generated around these hotspots triggers angiogenesis, attracting new blood vessels that provide local oxygen supply. Signaling through PANX-1 attracts microglia that establish contact with these cells, eventually leading to their elimination by phagocytosis. These cluster cells may provide the first evidence that specialized transient neuronal populations guide angiogenesis in the developing CNS through neural activity.

	<p>Background: 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA; GleolanTM, NX Development Corps., Lexington, USA) is approved for fluorescence-guided resections of suspected malignant gliomas. Experience has demonstrated that meningiomas also show fluorescence, which may be a useful surgical adjunct. We present an innovative design for a multi-center, prospective study to determine the clinical safety and potential benefit of fluorescence-guided resection of meningiomas with utmost bias reduction. Methods: All patients with suspected meningioma (all grades) receive GleolanTM 20 mg/kg 2&amp;amp;ndash;4 h prior to surgery supported by fluorescence excitation from a blue light source (Blue400, Zeiss Meditech, Oberkochen, Germany; FL400, Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Surgeons are asked whether a residual tumor can be observed to fluoresce under blue light (BL) after the tumor is no longer recognizable using conventional illumination at the end of surgery. In addition, when faced with tissues of uncertain tissue type (so-called &amp;amp;ldquo;indeterminate&amp;amp;rdquo; tissue), this study records how often surgeons make a correct decision based on fluorescence and how this influences surgical strategy. The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients in whom one of these two benefits are observed. Other endpoints include the diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence compared to white light (WL) versus correlative histology. For bias reduction, pertinent data are derived from surgical videos reviewed by independent reviewers blinded to surgeons&amp;amp;rsquo; assessments of tissue type and fluorescence status. Data will be included from approximately 100 study participants completing the study at approximately 15 centers in the United States, Germany, and Austria. Results: As of May 2022, 88 patients have completed the study. No adverse safety signal has been detected. Conclusions: Preliminary data confirm the feasibility of our study design. Accrual is targeted for completion in the third quarter of 2022.</p>

	<p>Background: Music stimulation is considered a valuable form of intervention in disorders of consciousness (DoC); for instance, verticalization may improve motor and cognitive recovery. Our purpose is to investigate the effects of a novel rehabilitative approach combining robotic verticalization training (RVT) with personalized music stimulation in people with DoC. Methods: Sixteen subjects affected by minimally conscious state due to traumatic brain lesions who attended our Intensive Neuro-Rehabilitation Unit were enrolled in this randomized trial. They received either music robotic verticalization (MRV) using the Erigo device plus a personalized music playlist or only RVT without music stimuli. Each treatment was performed 2 times a week for 8 consecutive weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Results: We found significant improvements in all patients&amp;amp;rsquo; outcomes in the experimental group (who received MRV): Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.02), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.03), Functional Communication Scale (FCS) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.007), Trunk Control Test (TCT) (p = 0.05). Significant differences between the two groups were also found in the main outcome measure CRS-R (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) but not for TCT and FIM. Conclusions: Our study supports the safety and effectiveness of RVT with the Erigo device in chronic MCS, and the achievement of better outcomes when RVT is combined with music stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general theory of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A theory is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present theory makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the theory holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantification of hypoxic regions distant from occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yidan Xue, Theodosia Georgakopoulou, Anne-Eva van der Wijk, Tamás I. Józsa, Ed van Bavel, Stephen J. Payne</p>

The microvasculature plays a key role in oxygen transport in the mammalian brain. Despite the close coupling between cerebral vascular geometry and local oxygen demand, recent experiments have reported that microvascular occlusions can lead to unexpected distant tissue hypoxia and infarction. To better understand the spatial correlation between the hypoxic regions and the occlusion sites, we used both <i>in vivo</i> experiments and <i>in silico</i> simulations to investigate the effects of occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees on tissue hypoxia. In a rat model of microembolisation, 25 μm microspheres were injected through the carotid artery to occlude penetrating arterioles. In representative models of human cortical columns, the penetrating arterioles were occluded by simulating the transport of microspheres of the same size and the oxygen transport was simulated using a Green’s function method. The locations of microspheres and hypoxic regions were segmented, and two novel distance analyses were implemented to study their spatial correlation. The distant hypoxic regions were found to be present in both experiments and simulations, and mainly due to the hypoperfusion in the region downstream of the occlusion site. Furthermore, a reasonable agreement for the spatial correlation between hypoxic regions and occlusion sites is shown between experiments and simulations, which indicates the good applicability of <i>in silico</i> models in understanding the response of cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport to microemboli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Signal neutrality, scalar property, and collapsing boundaries as consequences of a learned multi-timescale strategy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luca Manneschi, Guido Gigante, Eleni Vasilaki, Paolo Del Giudice</p>

We postulate that three fundamental elements underlie a decision making process: perception of time passing, information processing in multiple timescales and reward maximisation. We build a simple reinforcement learning agent upon these principles that we train on a random dot-like task. Our results, similar to the experimental data, demonstrate three emerging signatures. (1) signal neutrality: insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision. (2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies widely for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distributions stays almost unchanged. (3) Collapsing boundaries: the “effective” decision-making boundary changes over time in a manner reminiscent of the theoretical optimal. Removing the perception of time or the multiple timescales from the model does not preserve the distinguishing signatures. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for signal neutrality. We propose that it is not part of motor planning. It is part of the decision-making process and emerges from information processing on multiple timescales.

                Background: Acute renal transplant rejection is believed to be an immunological phenomenon and is one of the most serious consequences of transplantation as a treatment for end-stage renal illness. In recent decades, numerous research has been conducted to investigate the relationship between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 +49A/G (CTLA-4 +49A/G) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the likelihood of rejection; nevertheless, the results are still controversial, and inconsistency has been documented among investigations. Consequently, the purpose of the present investigation was to conduct a study on the relation between CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphism and risk of transplant rejection.  Methods: The study was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Retrospective and prospective analytical randomized control trial (RCTs) published prints from Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of science were included to the study in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted on February 2nd, 2022, using the search term (cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-antigen-4 OR CTLA-4) AND (gene polymorphism OR single nucleotide polymorphisms OR allele OR alleles OR genotype OR genotypes) AND (renal OR kidney) AND (transplant OR transplantation) AND (acute rejection).  Results: The CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype was more likely to be related to renal transplantation rejection risk. It was found with odds ratio (OR) in overall analysis of G vs. A-allele was 1.22 (95%CI 1.05-1.42; p-value=0.01) and the OR of GG vs. AG+AA-genotype was 1.47 (95%CI 1.14-1.89; p-value=0.003). However, the AA-genotype was not associated with renal transplantation rejection risk. The interesting finding in this study was the association of the SNPs and rejection of renal transplantation was especially found in Asian sub-analysis.  Conclusions: Consequently, the CTLA-4 G-allele/GG-genotype is related to the likelihood of rejection in patients underwent renal transplantation.

                Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a challenging pandemic globally. The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure. In-hospital mortality varies from 18.9% to 20.3%. Old age, male gender, co-morbidities, lower oxygen saturation, lymphopenia, raised C-reactive protein, and d-dimer levels increase the risk of critical illness and death. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and associated outcomes in a tertiary level hospital in Nepal. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary center of Nepal during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. A non-probabilistic consecutive sampling technique was adopted. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS), version-23. Mortality (yes/no) was the primary outcome of interest, and accordingly, the cases were divided into two groups, survivors and non-survivors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: The overall in-hospital mortality was 84 (19.58%), and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality was 36 (58.06%). The death rate was higher in cases presenting with shortness of breath and anorexia. Hypoxemic respiratory failure (16.08%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (8.62%) were the most common complications associated with higher mortality. Patients with older age had higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.077; p<0.001). The risk of mortality was higher in severe to critically ill patients (adjusted OR, 5.861; p=0.001), and those who were under mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR, 39.059; p<0.001). Likewise, the duration of hospital stay was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted OR, 0.795; p<0.001). Conclusions: The non-survivors of COVID-19 tended to be of older age, severe to critically ill at presentation, require mechanical ventilation, and have a shorter duration of hospital stay, compared to survivors. So, these groups of patients need special care and support during hospital admission.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.</p>
