              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Infected primary hydatid cyst of the thigh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hydatic cyst may occur in many organs such as the liver, lung, brain or heart with radiologic features of liver and lung involvement being well known. The musculo-skeletal site is infrequent accounting for 0.7–3% cases of all cases resulting from direct implantation of oncospheres more often than hematic dissemination. We report the case of an 18-year-old female student who visited our hospital because of a swelling in the posteroexternal aspect of the left thigh that had grown during the previous six months and had become tender in the previous month with setup of fever three days before admission. Superficial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic mass of the posterior compartment of the thigh developed within the short chief of the biceps femoris. Serology for hydatid cyst was positive. The diagnosis of an infected hydatid cyst was suspected preoperatively, and the patient was given antibiotics and anthelminthic treatment. The cyst was then completely excised and the histopathologic exam confirmed the hydatic origin. The patient was put on oral anti-helminthics and has been on regular follow up for last twelve months with no evidence of recurrence. Hydatidosis rarely occurs in the soft tissues and the diagnosis is challenging particularly when it is secondary infected. Hydatid serology provides certainty in the diagnosis of echinococcosis when it is positive. When it’s negative, imaging (Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be an approach for making the diagnosis revealing the most characteristic features of hydatid cyst.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Self-reported COVID-19 among physicians: An Egyptian online study during the pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract:  Background: COVID-19 causes a critical occupational risk to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who respond to the pandemic, as they are placed in environments with an increased risk of infection exposure. It is a public health priority to understand how transmission occurs to protect this vulnerable group of HCWs. This study was conducted to estimate the incidence of self-reported COVID-19 infection among physicians and its possible associated factors. Methods: An online national survey using Survey Monkey was initiated to collect sociodemographic e.g. age and sex, occupational e.g. place and duration of work, and clinical data e.g. COVID symptoms and laboratory investigations, and to describe affected physicians' diagnoses. Results: The self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection was found to be 65.4% among studied physicians. The significant independent predictors of COVID-19 infection were  smoking, working as a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than ten years [ARR (95% CI): 3.0(1.6-5.7), 2.3(1.4-3.8), 2.1(1.2-3.6), and 1.8(1.2-2.9); respectively]. Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 infection among Egyptian physicians is relatively high. Smoking, being a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than 10 years are all factors associated with an increased risk of infection. There should be strict application of preventive measures, periodic screening for COVID-19 for early detection and isolation of infected HCWs together with effective vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the performance of the Brazilian Portuguese Nottingham Health Profile in adult growth hormone deficiency and pulmonary hypertension [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a generic measure of perceived distress that has been used widely as an outcome measure in clinical practice and trials. The availability of two Brazilian datasets provided the opportunity to assess the psychometric performance of the NHP in different populations - adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The purpose of the study was to see how valuable the NHP could be in assessing outcomes in diseases where no disease-specific measures are available. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed with NHP data. Patients diagnosed with adult GHD or PH were administered the NHP during clinic visits on two occasions, two weeks apart. A disease-specific measure of quality of life (QoL) was also administered to the relevant sample of patients on each occasion. Results: The psychometric properties of the NHP were good for both disease groups. As expected, both samples reported high scores on energy level, the PH sample scored high on physical functioning and the GHD sample on emotional reactions. For both samples, most of the NHP sections were able to distinguish between groups of respondents with different ratings of perceived general health. While most sections of the NHP were relatively highly correlated with the QoL measures, pain and sleep did not seem to be important predictors of QoL in either of the samples. Conclusions: The use of the NHP in adult GHD and PH populations in Brazil is not recommended as there are high-quality disease-specific measures available for each disease. However, where no disease-specific measures are available, the NHP can provide good descriptive information of the impact of disease on different patient populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics of male university cricket club players in accordance to player position and height categories [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The scientific research into the varied factors that influence cricket performance has become a focal area for overall improved performance. Although there has been documented evidence for both anthropometry and physical fitness among elite cricketers, there is a paucity of evidence among the club cricket cohort. This pilot study aims to evaluate the anthropometric and fitness measurements among a pilot sample of university club cricketers (n = 17; 9 batsmen and 8 bowlers) in South Africa. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from the university’s male first cricket team of the 2019/2020 season. The data included both anthropometric (height, body mass, and body mass index) and physical fitness (explosive power, strength, Yo-Yo, speed and agility) parameters. The results exhibited for every parameter were presented according to height categories and player positions (batsman and bowler). Student t-tests were performed to determine the differences between fitness and anthropometric variables among both height categories and player positions. All data were analysed using SPSS (Version 26, IBM). The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The results indicated significant differences for height categories with regards to stature (p = 0.000) and agility (p = 0.03). Significant differences were also evident for different player positions with regards to body fat percentage (p = 0.02) and vertical jump distance (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study indicated that cricketers who are shorter in stature are less superior with regards to anthropometric and fitness capabilities than their taller counterparts. In addition to being aware of the variances that exist for anthropometry, stature and fitness among cricketers at any level; this study provides implications for both coaches and sports scientists at the club level (under-researched level) in terms of how this can translate to player performances in accordance to height categories and player positions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A case of tuberculosis lymphadenitis mimicking a gastric tumor [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Solitary tuberculosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a rare pathology that usually mimics the clinical and radiological features of malignant tumors. A gastric subepithelial tumor is usually detected during diagnostic endoscopy. Stomach tuberculosis, in particular, can appear as a subepithelial tumor of the stomach wall. Several cases of gastric tuberculosis imitating subepithelial gastric tumors have been reported recently. We describe the case of a patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis that mimics a submucosal gastric tumor. A 52-year-old female was admitted to our surgical department for epigastric pain and weight loss. Endoscopy was inconclusive; it revealed either a submucosal compression or an anterior submucosal lesion with erosive anterior gastropathy and a fistulous orifice located in the bulb. The patient was diagnosed with a gastric tumor and an endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a rounded hypoechogenic antral lesion that was not vascularized and was distant from the gastric wall, whose five layers appeared of a normal aspect. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A biopsy was sent intraoperatively for frozen section examination, and concluded that the diagnosis was tuberculous intraperitoneal lymphadenitis. The patient received anti-tuberculosis treatment. This case demonstrates that gastric tuberculosis remains a challenging diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Models of heterogeneous dopamine signaling in an insect learning and memory center</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Linnie Jiang, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body exhibits dopamine dependent synaptic plasticity that underlies the acquisition of associative memories. Recordings of dopamine neurons in this system have identified signals related to external reinforcement such as reward and punishment. However, other factors including locomotion, novelty, reward expectation, and internal state have also recently been shown to modulate dopamine neurons. This heterogeneity is at odds with typical modeling approaches in which these neurons are assumed to encode a global, scalar error signal. How is dopamine dependent plasticity coordinated in the presence of such heterogeneity? We develop a modeling approach that infers a pattern of dopamine activity sufficient to solve defined behavioral tasks, given architectural constraints informed by knowledge of mushroom body circuitry. Model dopamine neurons exhibit diverse tuning to task parameters while nonetheless producing coherent learned behaviors. Notably, reward prediction error emerges as a mode of population activity distributed across these neurons. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that accounts for the heterogeneity of dopamine activity during learning and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Trip duration drives shift in travel network structure with implications for the predictability of spatial disease spread</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John R. Giles, Derek AT Cummings, Bryan T. Grenfell, Andrew J. Tatem, Elisabeth zu Erbach-Schoenberg, CJE Metcalf, Amy Wesolowski</p>

Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread. Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Tooth morphology elucidates shark evolution across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohamad Bazzi, Nicolás E. Campione, Per E. Ahlberg, Henning Blom, Benjamin P. Kear</p>

Sharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their prolific fossil record is represented mainly by isolated shed teeth, which provide the basis for reconstructing deep time diversity changes affecting different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding shifts in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine tooth morphologies in multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction—this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Our results show that selachimorphs maintained virtually static levels of dental disparity in most of their constituent clades across the Cretaceous–Paleogene interval. Nevertheless, selective extinctions did impact apex predator species characterized by triangular blade-like teeth. This is particularly evident among lamniforms, which included the dominant Cretaceous anacoracids. Conversely, other groups, such as carcharhiniforms and orectolobiforms, experienced disparity modifications, while heterodontiforms, hexanchiforms, squaliforms, squatiniforms, and †synechodontiforms were not overtly affected. Finally, while some lamniform lineages disappeared, others underwent postextinction disparity increases, especially odontaspidids, which are typified by narrow-cusped teeth adapted for feeding on fishes. Notably, this increase coincides with the early Paleogene radiation of teleosts as a possible prey source, and the geographic relocation of disparity sampling “hotspots,” perhaps indicating a regionally disjunct extinction recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals a complex morphological response to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction and highlights an event that influenced the evolution of modern sharks.

                Using a modern machine learning approach, we show that the I/O characteristics of cortical pyramidal neurons can be approximated, at the millisecond resolution (single spike precision), by a temporally convolutional neural network with five to eight layers. This computational complexity stems mainly from the interplay between NMDA receptors and dendritic morphology.

                Tan et al. show that the majority of LIN28 binding sites are found on non-miRNA transcripts like coding and ribosomal RNA. Binding to non-miRNA sites sequesters LIN28 protein and competitively inhibits the regulation of miRNAs. Non-miRNA sites can thus modulate the strength of cellular miRNA activity in cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">CXCL10+ peripheral activation niches couple preferred sites of Th1 entry with optimal APC encounter</a></h4>

              
                Prizant et. al. identify a perivascular peripheral activation niche for T cells, defined by myeloid cell expression of the chemokine CXCL10. These CXCL10+ perivascular clusters serve as hotspots for T cell entry into the inflamed skin and a niche for early activation.

                Szodoray et al. demonstrate that T helper signals upregulate CD45 phosphatase activity in B cells through increased binding of Galectin-1 to CD45. High CD45 phosphatase activity in memory B cells controls their effective differentiation toward antibody-secreting cells in response to T cell help.

Mice carrying mutations in ADAR1 that prevent its binding to Z-RNA mimic the severe autoinflammatory phenotype of patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.

                Chai et al. show that CycK/CDK13 is a Nef-associated serine kinase complex. They provide additional insights into how Nef antagonizes SERINC5 via the endocytic machinery for optimal HIV-1 infectivity by identifying S360 as the SERINC5 phosphorylation site, which is required for its binding to Nef and its subsequent downregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Twisting of the zebrafish heart tube during cardiac looping is a tbx5-dependent and tissue-intrinsic process</a></h4>

              
                Organ laterality refers to the left-right asymmetry in disposition and conformation of internal organs and is established during embryogenesis. The heart is the first organ to display visible left-right asymmetries through its left-sided positioning and rightward looping. Here, we present a new zebrafish loss-of-function allele for <i>tbx5a</i>, which displays defective rightward cardiac looping morphogenesis. By mapping individual cardiomyocyte behavior during cardiac looping, we establish that ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes rearrange in distinct directions. As a consequence, the cardiac chambers twist around the atrioventricular canal resulting in torsion of the heart tube, which is compromised in <i>tbx5a</i> mutants. Pharmacological treatment and ex vivo culture establishes that the cardiac twisting depends on intrinsic mechanisms and is independent from cardiac growth. Furthermore, genetic experiments indicate that looping requires proper tissue patterning. We conclude that cardiac looping involves twisting of the chambers around the atrioventricular canal, which requires correct tissue patterning by Tbx5a.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Left-right side-specific endocrine signaling complements neural pathways to mediate acute asymmetric effects of brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Brain injuries can interrupt descending neural pathways that convey motor commands from the cortex to spinal motoneurons. Here, we demonstrate that a unilateral injury of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex of rats with completely transected thoracic spinal cord produces hindlimb postural asymmetry with contralateral flexion and asymmetric hindlimb withdrawal reflexes within 3 hr, as well as asymmetry in gene expression patterns in the lumbar spinal cord. The injury-induced postural effects were abolished by hypophysectomy and were mimicked by transfusion of serum from animals with brain injury. Administration of the pituitary neurohormones β-endorphin or Arg-vasopressin-induced side-specific hindlimb responses in naive animals, while antagonists of the opioid and vasopressin receptors blocked hindlimb postural asymmetry in rats with brain injury. Thus, in addition to the well-established involvement of motor pathways descending from the brain to spinal circuits, the side-specific humoral signaling may also add to postural and reflex asymmetries seen after brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of the Mechanosensor Channel Functionality of TACAN</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensitive ion channels mediate transmembrane ion currents activated by mechanical forces. A mechanosensitive ion channel called TACAN was recently reported. We began to study TACAN with the intent to understand how it senses mechanical forces and functions as an ion channel. Using cellular patch-recording methods we failed to identify mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Using membrane reconstitution methods we found that TACAN, at high protein concentrations, produces heterogeneous conduction levels that are not mechanosensitive and are most consistent with disruptions of the lipid bilayer. We determined the structure of TACAN using single particle cryo-EM and observe that it forms a symmetrical dimeric transmembrane protein. Each protomer contains an intracellular-facing cleft with a coenzyme-A cofactor, confirmed by mass spectrometry. The TACAN protomers are related in 3-dimensional structure to a fatty acid elongase, ELOVL. Whilst its physiological function remains unclear, we anticipate that TACAN is not a mechanosensitive ion channel.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning to stand with unexpected sensorimotor delays</a></h4>

              
                Human standing balance relies on self-motion estimates that are used by the nervous system to detect unexpected movements and enable corrective responses and adaptations in control. These estimates must accommodate for inherent delays in sensory and motor pathways. Here, we used a robotic system to simulate human standing in the anteroposterior direction about the ankles and impose sensorimotor delays into the control of balance. Imposed delays destabilized standing, but through training, participants adapted and re-learned to balance with the delays. Before training, imposed delays attenuated vestibular contributions to balance and triggered perceptions of unexpected standing motion, suggesting increased uncertainty in the internal self-motion estimates. After training, vestibular contributions partially returned to baseline levels and larger delays were needed to evoke perceptions of unexpected standing motion. Through learning, the nervous system accommodates balance sensorimotor delays by causally linking whole-body sensory feedback (initially interpreted as imposed motion) to self-generated balance motor commands.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporal pattern and synergy influence activity of ERK signaling pathways during L-LTP induction</a></h4>

              
                Long-lasting long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is a cellular mechanism of learning and memory storage. Studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in L-LTP produced by a diversity of temporal stimulation patterns. Multiple signaling pathways converge to activate ERK, with different pathways being required for different stimulation patterns. To answer whether and how different temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, we developed a computational model of five signaling pathways (including two novel pathways) leading to ERK activation during L-LTP induction. We show that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK and that stimuli given with large inter-trial intervals activate more ERK than shorter intervals. Furthermore, these pathways contribute to different dynamics of ERK activation. These results suggest that signaling pathways with different temporal sensitivity facilitate ERK activation to diversity of temporal patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Causal neural mechanisms of context-based object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Objects can be recognized based on their intrinsic features, including shape, color, and texture. In daily life, however, such features are often not clearly visible, for example when objects appear in the periphery, in clutter, or at a distance. Interestingly, object recognition can still be highly accurate under these conditions when objects are seen within their typical scene context. What are the neural mechanisms of context-based object recognition? According to parallel processing accounts, context-based object recognition is supported by the parallel processing of object and scene information in separate pathways. Output of these pathways is then combined in downstream regions, leading to contextual benefits in object recognition. Alternatively, according to feedback accounts, context-based object recognition is supported by (direct or indirect) feedback from scene-selective to object-selective regions. Here, in three pre-registered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments, we tested a key prediction of the feedback hypothesis: that scene-selective cortex causally and selectively supports context-based object recognition before object-selective cortex does. Early visual cortex (EVC), object-selective lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and scene-selective occipital place area (OPA) were stimulated at three time points relative to stimulus onset while participants categorized degraded objects in scenes and intact objects in isolation, in different trials. Results confirmed our predictions: relative to isolated object recognition, context-based object recognition was selectively and causally supported by OPA at 160–200 ms after onset, followed by LOC at 260–300 ms after onset. These results indicate that context-based expectations facilitate object recognition by disambiguating object representations in the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct roles of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms for establishing tension and elasticity during cell morphodynamics</a></h4>

              
                Nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is an integral part of essential cellular processes, including adhesion and migration. Mammalian cells express up to three isoforms termed NM IIA, B, and C. We used U2OS cells to create CRISPR/Cas9-based knockouts of all three isoforms and analyzed the phenotypes on homogenously-coated surfaces, in collagen gels, and on micropatterned substrates. In contrast to homogenously-coated surfaces, a structured environment supports a cellular phenotype with invaginated actin arcs even in the absence of NM IIA-induced contractility. A quantitative shape analysis of cells on micropatterns combined with a scale-bridging mathematical model reveals that NM IIA is essential to build up cellular tension during initial stages of force generation, while NM IIB is necessary to elastically stabilize NM IIA-generated tension. A dynamic cell stretch/release experiment in a three-dimensional scaffold confirms these conclusions and in addition reveals a novel role for NM IIC, namely the ability to establish tensional homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TMEM120A is a coenzyme A-binding membrane protein with structural similarities to ELOVL fatty acid elongase</a></h4>

              
                TMEM120A, also named as TACAN, is a novel membrane protein highly conserved in vertebrates and was recently proposed to be a mechanosensitive channel involved in sensing mechanical pain. Here we present the single particle cryo-EM structure of human TMEM120A which forms a tightly packed dimer with extensive interactions mediate by the N-terminal coiled coil domain (CCD), the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), and the re-entrant loop between the two domains. The TMD of each TMEM120A subunit contains six transmembrane helices (TMs) and has no clear structural feature of a channel protein. Instead, the six TMs form an α-barrel with a deep pocket where a coenzyme A (CoA) molecule is bound. Intriguingly, some structural features of TMEM120A resemble those of elongase for very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL) despite low sequence homology between them, pointing to the possibility that TMEM120A may function as an enzyme for fatty acid metabolism, rather than a mechanosensitive channel.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PRC1 Sustains the Memory of Neuronal Fate Independent of PRC2 Function</a></h4>

              
                Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 maintain stable cellular memories of early fate decisions by establishing heritable patterns of gene repression. PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We unexpectedly found that PRC2 is dispensable to preserve the morphogen-induced positional fates of spinal motor neurons (MNs), while PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted subtypes. Mutation of the core PRC1 component Ring1 in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including Hox transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in Ring1 mutants is due to the suppression of Hox networks by derepressed caudal Hox genes. These results indicate that PRC1 can function independently of de novo PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and transcriptional memory at the time of neuronal differentiation.

                Sexually dimorphic courtship behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster develop from the activity of the sexual differentiation genes, doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru), functioning with other regulatory factors that have received little attention. The dissatisfaction gene (dsf) encodes an orphan nuclear receptor homologous to vertebrate Tlx and Drosophila tailless that is critical for the development of several aspects of female- and male-specific sexual behaviors. Here, we report the pattern of dsf expression in the central nervous system and show that the activity of sexually dimorphic abdominal interneurons that co-express dsf and dsx is necessary and sufficient for vaginal plate opening in virgin females and abdominal curling in males during courtship. We find that dsf activity results in different neuroanatomical outcomes in females and males, promoting and suppressing, respectively, female development and function of the DDAG neurons depending upon the sexual state of dsx expression. We posit that dsf and dsx interact to specify sex differences in the neural circuitry for dimorphic abdominal behaviors.

                BDNF has remarkable protective roles in the central nervous system to ensure neurons and glial cell survival and proper functions. The regulatory processes behind the BDNF expression have not been revealed completely. Here, it was explored whether Malat1 and Hotair lncRNAs play roles in the regulation of Bdnf expression level, modification of fingolimod downstream pathway, and oligodendrocytes precursor cells maturation. By Hotair and Malat1 downregulation, their regulatory mechanism on Bdnf expression was investigated. Immunostaining and RT-qPCR assays were employed to assess the effects of fingolimod and lncRNAs on OPCs maturation. The results represented that Hotair and Malat1 lncRNAs may regulate Bdnf expression in primary glial cells significantly, and also can coordinate fingolimod stimulatory effect on Bdnf expression. Furthermore, Malat1 may have a role in the last stages of the intrinsic oligodendrocyte myelination. Here it was demonstrated that these lncRNAs have critical roles in the Bdnf level, fingolimod mechanism of action, and OPCs maturation. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of neurotrophins leads to a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disorder and designing more effective treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immediate Impact of Yogic Breathing on Pulsatile Cerebrospinal Fluid Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear fluid bathing the central nervous system (CNS), undergoes pulsatile movements, and plays a critical role for the removal of waste products from the brain including amyloid beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of CSF dynamics is critical for maintaining CNS health, and increased pulsatile CSF dynamics may alter brain's waste clearance due to increased mixing and diffusion. As such, understanding the mechanisms driving CSF movement, and interventions that influence its resultant removal of wastes from the brain is of high scientific and clinical impact. Since pulsatile CSF dynamics is sensitive and synchronous to respiratory movements, we are interested in identifying potential integrative therapies such as yogic breathing to regulate and enhance CSF dynamics, which has not been reported before. Here, we investigated the pre-intervention baseline data from our ongoing randomized controlled trial, and examined whether yogic breathing immediately impacts pulsatile CSF dynamics compared to spontaneous breathing. We utilized our previously established non-invasive real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (RT-PCMRI) approach using a 3T MRI instrument, and computed and rigorously tested differences in CSF velocities (instantaneous, respiratory, cardiac 1st and 2nd harmonics) at the level of foramen magnum during spontaneous versus four yogic breathing patterns. In examinations of 18 healthy participants (eight females, ten males; mean age 34.9 {+/-} 14 (SD) years; age range: 18-61 years), we discovered immediate increase in cranially-directed velocities of instantaneous-CSF 16% - 28% and respiratory-CSF 60% - 118% during yogic versus spontaneous breathing, with most statistically significant changes during deep abdominal breathing (28%, p=0.0008, and 118%, p=0.0001, respectively). Further, cardiac pulsation was the primary source of pulsatile CSF during all breathing conditions except during deep abdominal breathing, when there was a comparable contribution of respiratory and cardiac 1st harmonic power [0.59 {+/-} 0.78], demonstrating respiration can be the primary regulator of CSF depending on individual differences in breath depth and location. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of sustained training yogic breathing on increased pulsatile CSF dynamics and brain waste clearance for CNS health.

                Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons are involved in central chemoreception and respiratory control. Lineage tracing studies demonstrate RTN neurons to be derived from Phox2b and Atoh1 expressing progenitor cells in rhombere 4. Phox2b exon 3 mutations cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), producing an impaired respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. Our goal was to investigate the extent to which a conditional mutation of Phox2b within Atoh1-derived cells might affect a) respiratory rhythm; b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia and c) number of RTN-chemosensitive neurons. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional Phox2b{Delta}8 mutation activated by cre-recombinase. We crossed them with Atoh1Cre mice. Ventilation was measured by whole body plethysmograph during neonate and adult life. In room air, experimental and control groups showed similar basal ventilation; however, Atoh1Cre/Phox2b{Delta}8 increased breath irregularity. The hypercapnia and hypoxia ventilatory responses were impaired in neonates. In contrast, adult mice recovered ventilatory response to hypercapnia, but not to hypoxia. Anatomically, we observed a reduction of the Phox2b+/TH- expressing neurons within the RTN region. Our data indicates that conditionally expression of Phox2b mutation by Atoh1 affect development of the RTN neurons and are essential for the activation of breathing under hypoxic and hypercapnia condition, providing new evidence for mechanisms related to CCHS neuropathology

                In degenerative retinal disorders, rod and cone photoreceptors die, causing vision impairment and blindness. Downstream neurons survive but undergo morphological and physiological remodeling, with some retinal ganglion cells (RGC) exhibiting heightened spontaneous firing. Retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as the key signaling molecule that induces RGC hyperactivity, obscuring RGC light responses and reducing light avoidance behaviors triggered by residual rods and cones. However, evidence that RA-dependent remodeling corrupts image-forming vision has been lacking. Here we show that disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits RA synthesis, and BMS 493, an RA receptor (RAR) inhibitor, reduce RGC hyperactivity and augment image detection in visually impaired mice. Functional imaging of visual cortical neurons shows that disulfiram and BMS 493 sharpen orientation-tuning and strengthen response fidelity to naturalistic scenes. These findings establish a causal link between RA-induced retinal hyperactivity and vision impairment and define molecular targets and candidate drugs for boosting image-forming vision in retinal degeneration.

                Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential in the application of neurodegenerative disease therapy, drug screening and disease modeling. NSC can be generated by reprogramming from terminally differentiated cells with transcription factors or small molecules. However, current methods for producing NSCs involve the danger of integrating foreign genes into the genome and the problem of low efficiency. Here, we report an efficient method to generate NSCs from human skin-derived fibroblasts with microRNA (mir-302a) in 2-3 days. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) have more than 90% of purity. Their morphology is similar to regular NSCs, expressing key markers including Nestin, Pax6 and Sox2, and can be expanded for more than 20 passages in vitro. They can also differentiate into functional neuron progeny, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. Those cells can elicit action potential, can be xeno-transplanted into the brain of immune-deficient mice, and can survive and differentiate in vivo without tumor formation. This study shows that a single part of pluripotency-inducing mir-302 cluster can drive fibroblasts reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of individual-specific human NSCs for studies of neuron system development and regenerative cell therapy.

                Atmospheric Particulate Matter (PM) is one of the leading environmental risk factors for the global burden of disease. Increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that PM plays a significant role in CNS demyelinating disorders; however, there is no direct testimony of this, and yet the molecular mechanism by which the occurrence remains unclear. Using multiple in vivo and in vitro strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that PM exposure aggravates neuroinflammation, myelin injury, and dysfunction of movement coordination ability via boosting microglial pro inflammatory activities, in both the pathological demyelination and physiological myelinogenesis animal models. Indeed, pharmacological disturbance combined with RNA seq and ChIP seq suggests that TLR-4/NF-{kappa}B signaling mediated a core network of genes that control PM triggered microglia pathogenicity. In summary, our study defines a novel atmospheric environmental mechanism that mediates PM aggravated microglia pathogenic activities, and establishes a systematic approach for the investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.

                Normative modeling is an emerging and innovative framework for mapping individual differences at the level of a single subject or observation in relation to a reference model. It involves charting centiles of variation across a population in terms of mappings between biology and behavior which can then be used to make statistical inferences at the level of the individual. The fields of computational psychiatry and clinical neuroscience have been slow to transition away from patient versus healthy control analytic approaches, likely due to a lack of tools designed to properly model biological heterogeneity of mental disorders. Normative modeling provides a solution to address this issue and moves analysis away from case-control comparisons that rely on potentially noisy clinical labels. In this article, we define a standardized protocol to guide users through, from start to finish, normative modeling analysis using the Predictive Clinical Neuroscience toolkit (PCNtoolkit). We describe the input data selection process, provide intuition behind the various modeling choices, and conclude by demonstrating several examples of downstream analyses the normative model results may facilitate, such as stratification of high-risk individuals, subtyping, and behavioral predictive modeling.

                Methods to visualize gene expression in the Drosophila central nervous system are important in fly neurogenetic studies. In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol that sequentially combines in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and immunostaining to detect mRNA and protein expression in whole-mount Drosophila larval and adult central nervous systems. We demonstrate the application of in situ HCR in comparisons of nervous system gene expression between Drosophila species, and in the validation of single-cell RNA-Seq results in the fly nervous system. Our protocol provides a simple, robust, multiplexable, and relatively affordable means to quantitatively visualize gene expression in the nervous system of flies, facilitating its general use in fly neurogenetic studies.

                Purpose: When the speech motor system encounters errors, it generates adaptive responses to compensate for the errors. We previously showed that adaptive responses to task-irrelevant errors are significantly smaller than responses to task-relevant errors when errors are introduced gradually. The current study aimed to examine responses to task-irrelevant and task-relevant errors when errors are introduced suddenly. Method: We used an adaptation paradigm in which participants experienced task-relevant errors (induced by formant-shift perturbations) and task-irrelevant errors (induced by formant-clamp perturbations). For one group of participants (N = 30), we applied the perturbations gradually. The second group of participants (N = 30) received the perturbations suddenly. We designed the perturbations based on participant-specific vowel configurations such that a participant's first and second formants of /{varepsilon}/ were perturbed toward their /ae/. To estimate adaptive responses, we measured formant changes (within 0-100 ms of the vowel onset) in response to the formant perturbations. Results: We found that (1) the difference between adaptive responses to formant-shift and formant-clamp perturbations was the smallest for the suddenly introduced perturbations, and (2) responses to formant-shift perturbations positively correlated with responses to formant-clamp perturbations for the suddenly (but not gradually) introduced perturbations. Conclusions: These results showed that the speech motor system responds to task-relevant errors and task-irrelevant errors more differently when errors are introduced gradually than suddenly. Overall, the speech motor system evaluates the relevance of errors and uses its evaluation to modulate its adaptive responses to errors.

	<p>Astrocytes support and modulate neuronal activity through the release of L-lactate. The suggested roles of astrocytic lactate in the brain encompass an expanding range of vital functions, including central control of respiration and cardiovascular performance, learning, memory, executive behaviour and regulation of mood. Studying the effects of astrocytic lactate requires tools that limit the release of lactate selectively from astrocytes. Here, we report the validation in vitro of novel molecular constructs derived from enzymes originally found in bacteria, that when expressed in astrocytes, interfere with lactate handling. When lactate 2-monooxygenase derived from M. smegmatis was specifically expressed in astrocytes, it reduced intracellular lactate pools as well as lactate release upon stimulation. D-lactate dehydrogenase derived from L. bulgaricus diverts pyruvate towards D-lactate production and release by astrocytes, which may affect signalling properties of lactate in the brain. Together with lactate oxidase, which we have previously described, this set of transgenic tools can be employed to better understand astrocytic lactate release and its role in the regulation of neuronal activity in different behavioural contexts.</p>

	<p>Brain image segmentation is one of the most time-consuming and challenging procedures in a clinical environment. Recently, a drastic increase in the number of brain disorders has been noted. This has indirectly led to an increased demand for automated brain segmentation solutions to assist medical experts in early diagnosis and treatment interventions. This paper aims to present a critical review of the recent trend in segmentation and classification methods for brain magnetic resonance images. Various segmentation methods ranging from simple intensity-based to high-level segmentation approaches such as machine learning, metaheuristic, deep learning, and hybridization are included in the present review. Common issues, advantages, and disadvantages of brain image segmentation methods are also discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing methods. From this review, it is found that deep learning-based and hybrid-based metaheuristic approaches are more efficient for the reliable segmentation of brain tumors. However, these methods fall behind in terms of computation and memory complexity.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes provide neurons with diffusible factors that promote synapse formation and maturation. In particular, glypican-4/GPC4 released from astrocytes promotes the maturation of excitatory synapses. Unlike other secreted factors, GPC4 contains the C-terminal GPI-anchorage signal. However, the mechanism by which membrane-tethered GPC4 is released from astrocytes is unknown. Using mouse primary astrocyte cultures and a quantitative luciferase-based release assay, we show that GPC4 is expressed on the astrocyte surface via a GPI-anchorage. Soluble GPC4 is robustly released from the astrocytes largely by proteolytic shedding and, to a lesser extent, by GPI-anchor cleavage, but not by vesicular release. Pharmacological, overexpression, and loss of function screens showed that ADAM9 in part mediates the release of GPC4 from astrocytes. The released GPC4 contains the heparan sulfate side chain, suggesting that these release mechanisms provide the active form that promotes synapse maturation and function. Overall, our studies identified the release mechanisms and the major releasing enzyme of GPC4 in astrocytes and will provide insights into understanding how astrocytes regulate synapse formation and maturation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we report the independent discovery and validation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) as a modulator of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;Syn)-induced pathology and toxicity in cell-based Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) models. We identified SCD as top altered gene from transcriptional profiling in primary neurons exogenously expressing &alpha;Syn with the amplified familial PD mutation 3K. Thus, we sought to further explore SCD as a therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. We report that SCD inhibitors are toxic to early human and rat neuron cultures while displaying minimal toxicity to late cultures. The fatty acid product of SCD, oleic acid (OLA), fully rescues this toxicity in early cultures, suggesting on-target toxicity. Furthermore, SCD inhibition rescues &alpha;Syn 3K-induced toxicity in late primary neurons. We also confirm that SCD inhibitors reduce formation of &alpha;Syn accumulations, while OLA increases these accumulations in an &alpha;Syn 3K neuroblastoma model. However, we identify a caveat with this model where &alpha;Syn 3K levels can be suppressed by high SCD inhibitor concentrations, obscuring true effect size. Further, we show that both SCD1 or SCD5 knock-down reduce &alpha;Syn 3K accumulations and toxicity, making both a putative drug target. Overall, we confirm key findings of published data on SCD inhibition and its benefits in &alpha;Syn accumulation and stress models. The differential neurotoxicity induced by SCD inhibition based on neuron culture age must be accounted for when researching SCD in neuron models and has potential clinical implications. Lastly, our gene profiling studies also revealed novel putative genes connected to &alpha;Syn neurotoxicity that are worth further study.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The term "memory strength" generally refers to how well one remembers something. But more precisely it contains multiple modalities, such as how easily, how accurately, how confidently and how vividly we remember it. In human, these modalities of memory strength are dissociable. In this study, we asked whether we can isolate a behavioral component that is dissociable from others in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks in mice, which potentially reflect a modality of memory strength. Using a virus-mediated inducible method, we ablated immature neurons in the dentate gyrus in mice after we trained the mice with hippocampus-dependent memory tasks normally. In memory retrieval tests, these ablated mice initially showed intact performance. However, the ablated mice ceased learned behavior prematurely within a trial compared with control mice. In addition, the ablated mice showed shorter duration of individual episodes of learned behavior. Both affected behavioral measurements point to persistence of learned behavior. Thus, the effect of the postlearning manipulation showed dissociation between initial performance and persistence of learned behavior. These two behavioral components are likely to reflect different brain functions and be mediated by separate mechanisms, which might represent different modalities of memory strength. These simple dissociable measurements in widely used behavioral paradigms would be useful to understand detailed mechanisms underlying the expression of learned behavior and potentially different modalities of memory strength in mice. We also discuss a potential role that immature neurons in the dentate gyrus may play in persistence of learned behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Heterogeneous Expression of Nuclear Encoded Mitochondrial Genes Distinguishes Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mitochondrial composition varies by organ and their constituent cell types. This mitochondrial diversity likely determines variations in mitochondrial function. However, the heterogeneity of mitochondria in the brain remains underexplored despite the large diversity of cell types in neuronal tissue. Here, we used molecular systems biology tools to address whether mitochondrial composition varies by brain region and neuronal cell type in mice. We reasoned that proteomics and transcriptomics of microdissected brain regions combined with analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) could reveal the extent of mitochondrial compositional diversity. We selected nuclear encoded gene products forming complexes of fixed stoichiometry, such as the respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial ribosome, as well as molecules likely to perform their function as monomers, such as the family of SLC25 transporters. We found that the proteome encompassing these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and obtained from microdissected brain tissue segregated the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex from each other. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts could only segregate cell types and brain regions when the analysis was performed at the single-cell level. In fact, single-cell mitochondrial transcriptomes were able to distinguish glutamatergic and distinct types of GABAergic neurons from one another. Within these cell categories, unique SLC25A transporters were able to identify distinct cell subpopulations. Our results demonstrate heterogeneous mitochondrial composition across brain regions and cell types. We postulate that mitochondrial heterogeneity influences regional and cell type-specific mechanisms in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Correlates to Monaural Edge Pitch in the Distribution of Interspike Interval Statistics in the Auditory Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pitch is a perceptual attribute enabling perception of melody. There is no consensus regarding the fundamental nature of pitch and its underlying neural code. A stimulus which has received much interest in psychophysical and computational studies is noise with a sharp spectral edge. High-pass (HP) or low-pass (LP) noise gives rise to a pitch near the edge frequency (monaural edge pitch; MEP). The simplicity of this stimulus, combined with its spectral and autocorrelation properties, make it an interesting stimulus to examine spectral versus temporal cues that could underly its pitch. We recorded responses of single auditory nerve (AN) fibers in chinchilla to MEP-stimuli varying in edge frequency. Temporal cues were examined with shuffled autocorrelogram (SAC) analysis. Correspondence between the population&rsquo;s dominant interspike interval and reported pitch estimates was poor. A fuller analysis of the population interspike interval distribution, which incorporates not only the dominant but all intervals, results in good matches with behavioral results, but not for the entire range of edge frequencies that generates pitch. Finally, we also examined temporal structure over a slower time scale, intermediate between average firing rate and interspike intervals, by studying the SAC envelope. We found that, in response to a given MEP stimulus, this feature also systematically varies with edge frequency, across fibers with different characteristic frequency (CF). Because neural mechanisms to extract envelope cues are well established, and because this cue is not limited by coding of stimulus fine-structure, this newly identified slower temporal cue is a more plausible basis for pitch than cues based on fine-structure.</p>

                Oligodendrocytes wrap multiple lamellae of their membrane, myelin, around axons of the central nervous system (CNS), to improve impulse conduction. Myelin synthesis is specialised and dynamic, responsive to local neuronal excitation. Subtle pathological insults are sufficient to cause significant neuronal metabolic impairment, so myelin preservation is necessary to safeguard neural networks. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of the CNS. In MS, inflammatory attacks against myelin, proposed to be autoimmune, cause myelin decay and oligodendrocyte loss, leaving neurons vulnerable. Current therapies target the prominent neuroinflammation but are mostly ineffective in protecting from neurodegeneration and the progressive neurological disability. People with MS have substantially higher levels of extracellular glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter. This impairs cellular homeostasis to cause excitotoxic stress. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) could preserve myelin or allow its recovery by protecting cells from the resulting excessive excitability. This review evaluates the role of excitotoxic stress, myelination and BK channels in MS pathology, and explores the hypothesis that BK channel activation could be a therapeutic strategy to protect oligodendrocytes from excitotoxic stress in MS. This could reduce progression of neurological disability if used in parallel to immunomodulatory therapies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analyzed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalization of <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the encephalization quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalized than most if not all extant nonavian, nonmammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalization was fostered not only in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favored a degree of encephalization that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Contraceptive Use Dropout-adjusted Unmet Need for Family Planning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the last two decades, unmet need for family planning in Indonesia remains stagnant, and contraceptive discontinuation has increased. These two indicators describe the risk of unwanted pregnancy in a population. Therefore, this study aims to develop an accurate calculation of the unmet need for family planning in Indonesia.  Method: The study uses 2017 IDHS data to compare unmet need at survey-time and five years preceding the survey, measured by contraceptive calendar data that measured history of contraceptive use within five years preceding the survey. Unmet need at five years preceding the survey is measured by calculating the proportion of months not using contraceptive to the duration of months exposed to pregnancy in a period of 69 months. The study population is married women in Indonesia, with a sample size of 35,681.   Results: Unmet need with contraceptive calendar calculation is higher than unmet need at survey-time. A difference of 3% concerns an additional of nearly 1.6 million unwanted pregnancies. This study proves that the high number of contraceptive discontinuations is directly proportional to higher unmet need with contraceptive calendar calculation.  Conclusion: In Indonesia, with a relatively high contraceptive discontinuation rate, the calculation of unmet need using the calendar method is more precise than at survey-time method. The study results suggest the use of unmet need calendar for countries with high contraceptive discontinuation rate and provision of primary health care that is responsive to a potential unwanted pregnancy.

                Mixed infections with two or more species of Plasmodium are frequently reported due to vector factors, parasite factors (formation of hypnozoites) and host factors (residing in endemic areas, travel to endemic areas, inadequately treated previous infection, lack of compliance to therapy). Here we report a case of a 33-year-old Saudi female who had a significant travel history, and a peripheral blood smear (PBS) revealed mixed infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax. The case was successfully treated with a combination therapy of artemisinin and primaquine with follow up testing at three, seven, 14, and 28 days. Mixed malaria infections are especially reported in travelers to endemic areas. Hence, adequate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the cases contributes majorly to preventing relapse and controlling the disease. Travel consultations should be given to all travelers before their trips to endemic countries.

                Background: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukins 12 and 23. It is approved for treatment of Crohn’s disease (CD) in adults; however, there is a paucity of data regarding its use in pediatric CD. We describe our experience using ustekinumab in anti-TNF refractory CD pediatric patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review on pediatric patients with CD who were started on ustekinumab from January 2016 to November 2018. We collected patient’s clinical history, previous treatment history, surgeries related to CD, disease severity, as measured by abbrPCDAI, and endoscopic severity as recorded by SES-CD before and after ustekinumab. Results: We identified 10 patients with CD who were started on ustekinumab due to non-response to currently approved agents. Seven patients needed augmented maintenance dosing every 4-6 weeks to achieve clinical response or remission. Six of these seven patients had therapeutic drug monitoring during the course of treatment, with five patients showing subtherapeutic drug levels of <4.5 μg/mL while on standard maintenance dosing every 8 weeks, and four patients showing therapeutic drug levels of >4.5 μg/mL on augmented dosing interval. The remaining three patients were on standard maintenance dosing for the duration of treatment. Conclusion: In this retrospective chart review, 7 out of 10 patients with anti-TNF refractory pediatric-onset CD required augmented maintenance doses of ustekinumab to achieve clinical response or remission. A prospective study is needed to define appropriate ustekinumab dosing and interval in management of pediatric CD.

                <p>Pain is a recognized association with LGI1-/ CASPR2-antibodies. Of 147 patients, pain was experienced by 17/33 (52%) CASPR2- versus 20/108 (19%) LGI1-antibody patients (p=0.0005), and identified as neuropathic in 89% versus 58% of these, respectively. Typically, normal nerve conduction studies and reduced intraepidermal nerve fibre densities were observed in subsets of both cohorts. In LGI1-antibody patients, pain responded to immunotherapy (p=0.008), often rapidly, with greater residual patient-rated impairment observed in CASPR2-antibody patients (p=0.019). Serum CASPR2-antibodies, but not LGI1-antibodies, bound <i>in vitro</i> to unmyelinated human sensory neurons and rodent dorsal root ganglia, suggesting pathophysiological differences which may underlie our clinical observations.</p>

                <p>by Nikolas Dovrolis, Katerina Kassela, Konstantinos Konstantinidis, Adamantia Kouvela, Stavroula Veletza, Ioannis Karakasiliotis</p>

Viral metagenomics, also known as virome studies, have yielded an unprecedented number of novel sequences, essential in recognizing and characterizing the etiological agent and the origin of emerging infectious diseases. Several tools and pipelines have been developed, to date, for the identification and assembly of viral genomes. Assembly pipelines often result in viral genomes contaminated with host genetic material, some of which are currently deposited into public databases. In the current report, we present a group of deposited sequences that encompass ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contamination. We highlight the detrimental role of chimeric next generation sequencing reads, between host rRNA sequences and viral sequences, in virus genome assembly and we present the hindrances these reads may pose to current methodologies. We have further developed a refining pipeline, the Zero Waste Algorithm (ZWA) that assists in the assembly of low abundance viral genomes. ZWA performs context-depended trimming of chimeric reads, precisely removing their rRNA moiety. These, otherwise discarded, reads were fed to the assembly pipeline and assisted in the construction of larger and cleaner contigs making a substantial impact on current assembly methodologies. ZWA pipeline may significantly enhance virus genome assembly from low abundance samples and virus metagenomics approaches in which a small number of reads determine genome quality and integrity.

Discovering sequence features that differentially direct cells to alternate fates is key to understanding both cellular development and the consequences of disease related mutations. We introduce Expected Pattern Effect and Differential Expected Pattern Effect, two black-box methods that can interpret genome regulatory sequences for cell type-specific or condition specific patterns. We show that these methods identify relevant transcription factor motifs and spacings that are predictive of cell state-specific chromatin accessibility. Finally, we integrate these methods into framework that is readily accessible to non-experts and available for download as a binary or installed via PyPI or bioconda at https://cgs.csail.mit.edu/deepaccess-package/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Validation and tuning of in situ transcriptomics image processing workflows with crowdsourced annotations</a></h4>

Recent advancements in <i>in situ</i> methods, such as multiplexed <i>in situ</i> RNA hybridization and <i>in situ</i> RNA sequencing, have deepened our understanding of the way biological processes are spatially organized in tissues. Automated image processing and spot-calling algorithms for analyzing <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images have many parameters which need to be tuned for optimal detection. Having ground truth datasets (images where there is very high confidence on the accuracy of the detected spots) is essential for evaluating these algorithms and tuning their parameters. We present a first-in-kind open-source toolkit and framework for <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics image analysis that incorporates crowdsourced annotations, alongside expert annotations, as a source of ground truth for the analysis of <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images. The kit includes tools for preparing images for crowdsourcing annotation to optimize crowdsourced workers’ ability to annotate these images reliably, performing quality control (QC) on worker annotations, extracting candidate parameters for spot-calling algorithms from sample images, tuning parameters for spot-calling algorithms, and evaluating spot-calling algorithms and worker performance. These tools are wrapped in a modular pipeline with a flexible structure that allows users to take advantage of crowdsourced annotations from any source of their choice. We tested the pipeline using real and synthetic <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images and annotations from the Amazon Mechanical Turk system obtained via Quanti.us. Using real images from <i>in situ</i> experiments and simulated images produced by one of the tools in the kit, we studied worker sensitivity to spot characteristics and established rules for annotation QC. We explored and demonstrated the use of ground truth generated in this way for validating spot-calling algorithms and tuning their parameters, and confirmed that consensus crowdsourced annotations are a viable substitute for expert-generated ground truth for these purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Label-free imaging and classification of live P. falciparum enables high performance parasitemia quantification without fixation or staining</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Lebel, Rebekah Dial, Venkata N. P. Vemuri, Valentina Garcia, Joseph DeRisi, Rafael Gómez-Sjöberg</p>

Manual microscopic inspection of fixed and stained blood smears has remained the gold standard for <i>Plasmodium</i> parasitemia analysis for over a century. Unfortunately, smear preparation consumes time and reagents, while manual microscopy is skill-dependent and labor-intensive. Here, we demonstrate that deep learning enables both life stage classification and accurate parasitemia quantification of ordinary brightfield microscopy images of live, unstained red blood cells. We tested our method using both a standard light microscope equipped with visible and near-ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and a custom-built microscope employing deep-UV illumination. While using deep-UV light achieved an overall four-category classification of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood stages of greater than 99% and a recall of 89.8% for ring-stage parasites, imaging with near-UV light on a standard microscope resulted in 96.8% overall accuracy and over 90% recall for ring-stage parasites. Both imaging systems were tested extrinsically by parasitemia titration, revealing superior performance over manually-scored Giemsa-stained smears, and a limit of detection below 0.1%. Our results establish that label-free parasitemia analysis of live cells is possible in a biomedical laboratory setting without the need for complex optical instrumentation. We anticipate future extensions of this work could enable label-free clinical diagnostic measurements, one day eliminating the need for conventional blood smear analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dendritic normalisation improves learning in sparsely connected artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex D. Bird, Peter Jedlicka, Hermann Cuntz</p>

Artificial neural networks, taking inspiration from biological neurons, have become an invaluable tool for machine learning applications. Recent studies have developed techniques to effectively tune the connectivity of sparsely-connected artificial neural networks, which have the potential to be more computationally efficient than their fully-connected counterparts and more closely resemble the architectures of biological systems. We here present a normalisation, based on the biophysical behaviour of neuronal dendrites receiving distributed synaptic inputs, that divides the weight of an artificial neuron’s afferent contacts by their number. We apply this dendritic normalisation to various sparsely-connected feedforward network architectures, as well as simple recurrent and self-organised networks with spatially extended units. The learning performance is significantly increased, providing an improvement over other widely-used normalisations in sparse networks. The results are two-fold, being both a practical advance in machine learning and an insight into how the structure of neuronal dendritic arbours may contribute to computation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PPIDomainMiner: Inferring domain-domain interactions from multiple sources of protein-protein interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Seyed Ziaeddin Alborzi, Amina Ahmed Nacer, Hiba Najjar, David W. Ritchie, Marie-Dominique Devignes</p>

Many biological processes are mediated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Because protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, PPIs likely rely on domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Several attempts exist to infer DDIs from PPI networks but the produced datasets are heterogeneous and sometimes not accessible, while the PPI interactome data keeps growing.
We describe a new computational approach called “PPIDM” (Protein-Protein Interactions Domain Miner) for inferring DDIs using multiple sources of PPIs. The approach is an extension of our previously described “CODAC” (Computational Discovery of Direct Associations using Common neighbors) method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph. The PPIDM method has been applied to seven widely used PPI resources, using as “Gold-Standard” a set of DDIs extracted from 3D structural databases. Overall, PPIDM has produced a dataset of 84, 552 non-redundant DDIs. Statistical significance (p-value) is calculated for each source of PPI and used to classify the PPIDM DDIs in Gold (9, 175 DDIs), Silver (24, 934 DDIs) and Bronze (50, 443 DDIs) categories. Dataset comparison reveals that PPIDM has inferred from the 2017 releases of PPI sources about 46% of the DDIs present in the 2020 release of the 3did database, not counting the DDIs present in the Gold-Standard. The PPIDM dataset contains 10, 229 DDIs that are consistent with more than 13, 300 PPIs extracted from the IMEx database, and nearly 23, 300 DDIs (27.5%) that are consistent with more than 214, 000 human PPIs extracted from the STRING database. Examples of newly inferred DDIs covering more than 10 PPIs in the IMEx database are provided.
Further exploitation of the PPIDM DDI reservoir includes the inventory of possible partners of a protein of interest and characterization of protein interactions at the domain level in combination with other methods. The result is publicly available at http://ppidm.loria.fr/.

                Background: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a malignant disease of the urothelial cell lining the upper urinary tract from renal calyces, pelvises, and ureter down to the ureteral orifice. Urothelial carcinoma is a multifocal malignant tumor which tends to reoccur after treatment. Radical cystectomy shows that upper tract recurrence occurs in 0.75% to 6.4% of patients. The occurrence of contralateral UTUC after nephroureterectomy is rarer with a prevalence of 0.5%. Case presentation: The case of a 43-year-old male with metachronous bilateral UTUC was reported. The patient had undergone gemcitabine-cysplatine neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cT2N0M0. Left hydronephrosis was discovered three months after the procedure. The patient was diagnosed with left UTUC cT4N0M0 of renal pyelum after a series of examinations. A left open radical nephroureterectomy was conducted to remove the mass followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This was followed up with routine ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every three months with a “tumor-free” period of 26 months. Meanwhile, the patient was re-admitted with fever and an increase in creatinine value of 4.3. After further workups, the patient was diagnosed with UTUC cT2N0M0 of the right renal pyelum. A kidney sparring approach with laser evaporation of the tumor was conducted followed by eight cycles of Gemcitabine intracavity antegrade per nephrostomy. After the regimen was finished, an MRI evaluation was conducted to assess treatment results, and the mass had decreased. Conclusions: This report showed a rare case of urothelial cell carcinoma recurrences. From bladder urothelial carcinoma to left UTUC and then to contralateral UTUC. It is important to evaluate the upper tract to reduce the risk of recurrence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A comparative study of red brick powder and lime as soft soil stabilizer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Soil has an important role to play in planning buildings because it supports the loads above it. Different types of soil with poor mechanical properties require more attention. Therefore, it is necessary to put in more effort to stabilize soil in order to improve its properties. This study aimed to compare the potential of lime and brick powder as stabilizers based on the values of California bearing ratio (CBR). Soil stabilization can be defined as the process of stabilizing soil properties by chemical or physical means to improve its engineering efficiency. The main objectives of stabilizing soil are to increase the bearing capacity of soil, to increase its resistance to weathering processes, and its permeability. Methods: In this work laboratory tests were done with disturbed and undisturbed soil samples. The proportions of lime or red brick powder additives mixed together are 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the original soil sample. From the results of the laboratory tests, the soil type obtained is MH soil based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The MH soil type is a low plasticity silt soil. Results: The study’s results showed that with the addition of lime and brick powder, the soil could be stabilized. In both soaked and unsoaked CBR tests, there was an increase in the CBR value for each proportion of the mixed additives. However, red brick powder had a significant increase of 15%. Conclusions: This study found a very large range of variations because of the many material requirements for each test. We suggest other researchers perform the CBR test by reducing the range of variations in the additives to get firm data and using our experimental procedure in this study for further research.

                Background: Hikikomori is a Japanese social withdrawal phenomenon which, in recent years, is spreading in western developed countries as well. Spending a lot of time secluded indoors, watching and playing with fictional narratives may be relatively common for Hikikomori people and may represent a protective factor for their psychological well-being.   Method: We evaluated the role of enjoying fictional narratives on empathy, relaxation, depression, and anxiety in people with Hikikomori experience, in relation to their daily consumption of fictional narratives and their emotional transportation toward fictional narratives. Hikikomori from one psychiatric clinic and three different support facilities were enrolled in this study. Multidimensional empathy scale, CES-D, STAI questionnaire, and relaxation inventory self-report scale were used as outcome measures.        Results: We found a significant correlation between empathy and emotional transportation toward fictional narratives and between relaxation during watching and reading fictional narratives and consumption frequency of fictional narratives.  We failed, however, to find any significant correlation with depression and anxiety.   Conclusions: These findings suggest a possible correlation between fiction and empathy/relaxation response; however, any causal relationship is not proven, consequently we deem that further investigations with a larger sample size are required for a better understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption among adults in Cambodia: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Soft drinks are an attractive and popular drink, consumed by many people to fulfill their energy. However, soft drink consumption is an important risk factor for non-communicable diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption among adults in Cambodia.  Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study with multi-stage random sampling was used to select 749 respondents from 12 communes across 5 districts in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. A structured questionnaire was used to assess socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. Crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confident intervals (CI) were calculated to show the strength of associations. Results: The overall prevalence of soft drink consumption was 44.73% (95%CI: 41.16-48.30%) across the sample population. The final model of multiple logistic regression showed only four factors to be significantly associated with soft drink consumption: gender, age, family size and income. Respondents most likely to consume soft drinks were men (AOR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.10-2.00; p=0.009), those aged 31-59 years (AOR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.98-4.62; p<0.001), those in a household of less than 5 individuals (AOR: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.44-3.19; p=0.036), and those earning <300$/month (AOR: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.10-2.31; p=0.003). Conclusion: The prevalence of soft drink consumption in Cambodia is a major concern for public health. The predictive factors significantly associated with soft drink consumption identified by this study were gender, age, household size and income. Therefore, all stakeholders should contribute to social marketing and intervention focusing on reducing the consumption of soft drinks through advertising on social media, television and other popular media platforms. Furthermore, additional taxation of soft drinks should be considered.

                The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced athletes to learn to navigate a world void of athletic competition and contend with the intricacies that life during a pandemic brings. Similarly, those that dedicate their lives to these athletes such as sport psychology practitioners, sport medicine personnel, athletic trainers, or academic advisors (i.e., sport support professionals) also experienced an abrupt ending to their routines, and in some cases their livelihoods. These professionals have been pushed to modify their art and find ways to engage their community from a distance (e.g., virtually, or physically from a social distance). Sport support professionals are experiencing a collective loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the impact of a global pandemic and the subsequent issues faced by sport support professionals across diverse disciplines, emphasizing the significance of these relationships and the necessary adjustments to manage the cessation of these relationships.

                Background: Voluntary therapeutic interventions to reduce unwanted same-sex sexuality are collectively known as sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE).  Currently almost all evidence addressing the contested question whether SOCE is effective or safe consists of anecdotes or very small sample qualitative studies of persons who currently identify as sexual minority and thus by definition failed to change.  We conducted this study to examine the efficacy and risk outcomes for a group of SOCE participants unbiased by current sexual orientation.       Methods: We examined a convenience sample of 125 men who had undergone SOCE for homosexual-to-heterosexual change in sexual attraction, identity and behavior, and for positive and negative changes in psychosocial problem domains (depression, suicidality, self-harm, self-esteem, social function, and alcohol or substance abuse).  Mean change was assessed by parametric (t-test) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon sign rank test) significance tests.   Results: Exposure to SOCE was associated with significant declines in same-sex attraction (from 5.7 to 4.1 on the Kinsey scale, p <.000), identification (4.8 to 3.6, p < .000), and sexual activity (2.4 to 1.5 on a 4-point scale of frequency, p < .000). From 45% to 69% of SOCE participants achieved at least partial remission of unwanted same-sex sexuality; full remission was achieved by 14% for sexual attraction and identification, and 26% for sexual behavior.  Rates were higher among married men, but 4-10% of participants experienced increased same-sex orientation after SOCE.  From 0.8% to 4.8% of participants reported marked or severe negative psychosocial change following SOCE, but 12.1% to 61.3% reported marked or severe positive psychosocial change.  Net change was significantly positive for all problem domains.   Conclusion: SOCE was perceived as an effective and safe therapeutic practice by this sample of participants.  We close by offering a unifying understanding of discrepant findings within this literature and caution against broad generalizations of our results.

<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants show impressive navigation capabilities during foraging. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges. Here, we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males (♂), gynes (♀), and foragers (☿) by quantifying relative neuropil volumes, synaptic architecture, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe olfactory glomeruli. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants are charismatic central place foragers. After long-ranging foraging trips, individual workers navigate back to their nest relying mostly on visual cues. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges, i.e. mate finding and colony foundation. Here we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males, gynes, and foragers by quantifying relative neuropil volumes associated with two visual pathways, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe (AL) olfactory glomeruli. Furthermore, we determined absolute numbers of synaptic complexes in visual and olfactory regions of the mushroom bodies (MB) and a major relay station of the sky-compass pathway to the central complex (CX). Both female castes possess enlarged brain centers for sensory integration, learning, and memory, reflected in voluminous MBs containing about twice the numbers of synaptic complexes compared with males. Overall, male brains are smaller compared with both female castes, but the relative volumes of the optic lobes and CX are enlarged indicating the importance of visual guidance during innate behaviors. Male ALs contain greatly enlarged glomeruli, presumably involved in sex-pheromone detection. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cis-regulatory variants affect gene expression dynamics in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences depends on how they affect gene expression and motivates both the identification and prediction of <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants responsible for expression differences within and between species. While much progress has been made in relating <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants to expression levels, the timing of gene activation and repression may also be important to the evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences. We investigated allele-specific expression (ASE) dynamics within and between <i>Saccharomyces</i> species during the diauxic shift and found appreciable <i>cis</i>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. Within species ASE is associated with intergenic variants, and ASE dynamics are more strongly associated with insertions and deletions than ASE levels. To refine these associations we used a high-throughput reporter assay to test promoter regions and individual variants. Within the subset of regions that recapitulated endogenous expression we identified and characterized <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants that affect expression dynamics. Between species, chimeric promoter regions generate novel patterns and indicate constraints on the evolution of gene expression dynamics. We conclude that changes in <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences can tune gene expression dynamics and that the interplay between expression dynamics and other aspects expression are relevant to the evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural mechanisms of modulations of empathy and altruism by beliefs of others' pain</a></h4>

              
                Perceived cues signaling others' pain induce empathy which in turn motivates altruistic behavior toward those who appear suffering. This perception-emotion-behavior reactivity is the core of human altruism but does not always occur in real life situations. Here, by integrating behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging measures, we investigate neural mechanisms underlying modulations of empathy and altruistic behavior by beliefs of others' pain. We show evidence that lack of beliefs of others' pain reduces subjective estimation of others' painful feelings and decreases monetary donations to those who show pain expressions. Moreover, lack of beliefs of others' pain attenuates neural responses to their pain expressions within 200 ms after face onset and modulates neural responses to others' pain in the insular, post-central, and frontal cortices. Our findings suggest that beliefs of others’ pain provide a cognitive basis of human empathy and altruism and unravel the intermediate neural mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hsp40s play complementary roles in the prevention of tau amyloid formation</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein, tau, is the major subunit of neurofibrillary tangles associated with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the cell, however, tau aggregation can be prevented by a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones. While numerous chaperones are known to interact with tau, though, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which these prevent tau aggregation. Here, we describe the effects of ATP-independent Hsp40 chaperones, DNAJA2 and DNAJB1, on tau amyloid-fiber formation, and compare these to the small heat-shock protein HSPB1. We find that the chaperones play complementary roles, with each preventing tau aggregation differently and interacting with distinct sets of tau species. Whereas HSPB1 only binds tau monomers, DNAJB1 and DNAJA2 recognize aggregation-prone conformers and even mature fibers. In addition, we find that both Hsp40s bind tau seeds and fibers via their C-terminal domain II (CTDII), with DNAJA2 being further capable of recognizing tau monomers by a second, distinct site in CTDI. These results lay out the mechanisms by which the diverse members of the Hsp40 family counteract the formation and propagation of toxic tau aggregates, and highlight the fact that chaperones from different families/classes play distinct, yet complementary roles in preventing pathological protein aggregation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variation in the modality of a yeast signaling pathway is mediated by a single regulator</a></h4>

              
                Bimodal gene expression by genetically identical cells is a pervasive feature of signaling networks, and has been suggested to allow organisms to hedge their "bets" in uncertain conditions. In the galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gene induction is unimodal or bimodal depending on natural genetic variation and pre-induction conditions. Here, we find that this variation in modality arises from regulation of two features of the pathway response: the fraction of cells that show induction, and their level of expression. GAL3, the galactose sensor, controls the fraction of induced cells, and titrating its expression is sufficient to control modality; moreover, all the observed differences in modality between different pre-induction conditions and amongst natural isolates can be explained by changes in GAL3's regulation and activity. The ability to switch modality by tuning the activity of a single protein may allow rapid adaptation of bet hedging to maximize fitness in complex environments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Galectin-9 regulates the threshold of B cell activation and autoimmunity</a></h4>

              
                Despite the mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance, the mature B cell compartment contains cells reactive for self-antigen. How these cells are poised not to respond and the mechanisms that restrain B cell responses to low-affinity endogenous antigens are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the glycan-binding protein galectin-9 in setting the threshold of B cell activation and that loss of this regulatory network is sufficient to drive spontaneous autoimmunity. We further demonstrate a critical role for galectin-9 in restraining not only conventional B-2 B cells, but also innate-like B-1a cells. We show that galectin-9-deficient mice have an expanded population of B-1a cells and increased titers of B-1a-derived autoantibodies. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that galectin-9 regulates BCR and distinct TLR responses in B-1a cells, but not B-1b cells, by regulating the interaction between BCR and TLRs with the regulatory molecules CD5 and CD180, respectively. In the absence of galectin-9, B-1a cells are more readily activated and secrete increased titers of autoantibodies that facilitate autoantigen delivery to the spleen, driving autoimmune responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Purkinje cell outputs selectively inhibit a subset of unipolar brush cells in the input layer of the cerebellar cortex</a></h4>

              
                Circuitry of the cerebellar cortex is regionally and functionally specialized. Unipolar brush cells (UBCs), and Purkinje cell (PC) synapses made by axon collaterals in the granular layer, are both enriched in areas that control balance and eye movement. Here, we find a link between these specializations in mice: PCs preferentially inhibit metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1)-expressing UBCs that respond to mossy fiber (MF) inputs with long lasting increases in firing, but PCs do not inhibit mGluR1-lacking UBCs. PCs inhibit about 29% of mGluR1-expressing UBCs by activating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and inhibit almost all mGluR1-expressing UBCs by activating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs). PC to UBC synapses allow PC output to regulate the input layer of the cerebellar cortex in diverse ways. Based on optogenetic studies and a small number of paired recordings, GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated feedback is fast and unreliable. GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition is slower and is sufficiently large to strongly influence the input-output transformations of mGluR1-expressing UBCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binocular rivalry reveals an out-of-equilibrium neural dynamics suited for decision-making</a></h4>

              
                In ambiguous or conflicting sensory situations, perception is often ‘multistable’ in that it perpetually changes at irregular intervals, shifting abruptly between distinct alternatives. The interval statistics of these alternations exhibits quasi-universal characteristics, suggesting a general mechanism. Using binocular rivalry, we show that many aspects of this perceptual dynamics are reproduced by a hierarchical model operating out of equilibrium. The constitutive elements of this model idealize the metastability of cortical networks. Independent elements accumulate visual evidence at one level, while groups of coupled elements compete for dominance at another level. As soon as one group dominates perception, feedback inhibition suppresses supporting evidence. Previously unreported features in the serial dependencies of perceptual alternations compellingly corroborate this mechanism. Moreover, the proposed out-of-equilibrium dynamics satisfies normative constraints of continuous decision-making. Thus, multistable perception may reflect decision-making in a volatile world: integrating evidence over space and time, choosing categorically between hypotheses, while concurrently evaluating alternatives.

                Substantia nigra dopamine (SN DA) neurons are progressively lost in Parkinson disease (PD). While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of their differential vulnerability and degeneration have been extensively studied, we still know very little about potential functional adaptations of those SN DA neurons that at least for some time manage to survive during earlier stages of PD. We utilized a partial lesion 6-OHDA mouse model to characterize initial electrophysiological impairments and chronic adaptations of surviving identified SN DA neurons, both in vivo and in vitro. Early after lesion (3 weeks), we detected a selective loss of in vivo burst firing in surviving SN DA neurons, which was accompanied by in vitro pacemaker instability. In contrast, late after lesion (>2 months), in vivo firing properties of surviving SN DA neurons had recovered in the presence of 2-fold accelerated pacemaking in vitro. Finally, we show that this chronic cell-autonomous adaptation in surviving SN DA neurons was mediated by Kv4.3 channel downregulation. Our study demonstrates substantial homeostatic plasticity of surviving SN DA neurons after a single-hit non-progressive lesion, which might contribute to the phenotype of initially surviving SN DA neurons in PD.

                Members of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzyme family are abundantly expressed in insect olfactory tissues, where they are thought to act as Odorant Degrading Enzymes (ODEs). However, their contribution to olfactory signaling in vivo is poorly understood. This is due in part to the challenge of identifying which of the dozens of antennal-expressed CYPs might inactivate a given odorant. Here, we tested a high-throughput deorphanization strategy in Drosophila to identify CYPs that are transcriptionally induced by exposure to a plant volatile. We discovered three CYPs selectively upregulated by the odorant using transcriptional profiling. Although these CYPs are shown to be broadly expressed in the antenna in non-neuronal cells, electrophysiological recordings from CYP mutants did not reveal any changes in olfactory neuron responses to the odorant. Neurons were desensitized by pre-exposing flies to the odorant, but this effect was similar in CYP mutants. Together, our data suggest that this transcriptomic approach may not be useful for identifying CYPs that contribute to olfactory signaling. We go on to show that some CYPs have highly restricted expression patterns in the antenna, and suggest that such CYPs may be useful candidates for further studies on olfactory CYP function.

                Since the beginning prion research has been largely dependent on animal models for deciphering the disease, drug development or prion detection and quantification. Thereby, ethical as well as cost and labour-saving aspects call for alternatives in vitro. Cell models can replace or at least complement animal studies, but their number is still limited and the application usually restricted to certain strains and host species due to often strong transmission barriers. Bank voles promise to be an exception as they or materials prepared from them are uniquely susceptible to prions from various species in vivo, in vitro and in cell-free applications. Here we present a mainly astrocyte-based primary glia cell assay from bank vole, which is infectible with scrapie strains from bank vole, mouse and hamster. Stable propagation of bank vole-adapted RML, murine 22L and RML, and hamster 263K scrapie is detectable from 20 or 30 days post exposure onwards. Thereby, the infected bank vole glia cells show similar or even faster prion propagation than likewise infected glia cells of the corresponding murine or hamster hosts. We propose that our bank vole glia cell assay could be a versatile tool for studying and comparing multiple prion strains with different species backgrounds in a single cell assay.

                Preys use their memory - where they sensed a predatory threat and whether a safe shelter is nearby - to dynamically control their survival instinct to avoid harm and reach safety. However, it remains unknown which brain regions are involved, and how such top-down control of innate behaviour is implemented at the circuit level. Here, we show that the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is best positioned to perform this task as an exclusive target of the hippocampus (HPC) within the medial hypothalamic defense system. Selective optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AHN revealed that the HPC[-&gt;]AHN pathway not only mediates the contextual memory of predator threats but also controls the goal-directed escape by transmitting information about the surrounding environment. These results reveal a new mechanism for experience-dependent, top-down control of innate defensive behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A photo-switchable assay system for dendrite degeneration and repair in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegeneration arising from aging, injury or disease has devastating health consequences. Whereas neuronal survival and axon degeneration have been studied extensively, much less is known about how neurodegeneration impacts dendrites. To develop an assay for dendrite degeneration and repair in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system, we used photo-switchable caspase-3 (caspase-LOV) to induce neuronal damage with tunable severity by adjusting illumination duration, thereby revealing cell type-specific responses to caspase-3 induced dendrite degeneration in dendrite arborization (da) neurons. To ask whether mechanisms underlying axon degeneration also govern dendrite degeneration, we tested the involvement of the Wallerian degeneration pathway by examining the effects of expressing the mouse Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) protein and knockdown of the Drosophila sterile alpha/Armadillo/Toll-Interleukin receptor homology domain protein (dSarm1) and Axundead (Axed) in class 4 da neurons. Here we report WldS expression or knockdown of dSarm1 improved dendrite repair following caspase-3 induced dendrite degeneration. Whereas both dSarm1 and Axed were required for thermal nocifensive behavior in uninjured animals, WldS expression improved the recovery of thermal nocifensive behavior that was impaired by chronic low-level of caspase-LOV activity. By establishing ways to induce graded dendrite degeneration, we uncover a protective role of WldS in caspase-3 induced dendrite degeneration and repair.

                Reductions in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are associated with cognitive impairment and increased risk of neurodegenerative disease in advanced age. In mouse models, reduced IGF-1 early-in-life leads to memory impairments and synaptic dysfunction; however, these models are limited by systemic reductions in IGF-1. We hypothesized that IGF-1 continues to promote hippocampal neuron structure and function after development, and as such, the loss of IGF-1 signaling in adult neurons would lead to impaired spatial learning and memory. To test this, the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was genetically targeted in hippocampal neurons of adult male and female mice. Male mice deficient in neuronal IGF-1R exhibited spatial learning impairments as evidenced by increased pathlength and errors in the radial arm water maze. No differences in learning and memory were observed in female mice. Golgi-Cox staining revealed a reduced number of dendritic boutons of neurons the CA1 region of the hippocampus in male mice. Decreased MAPK and increased ROCK activity were also observed in these tissues. In vitro studies revealed that impaired neurite outgrowth due to inhibited IGF-1R signaling could be rescued by pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK. However, ROCK inhibition in neuronal IGF-1R deficient mice did not fully rescue learning impairments or bouton numbers. Together, our study highlights that IGF-1 continues to support spatial learning and memory and neuronal structure in adulthood.

                There is increasing evidence that including sex as a biological variable is of crucial importance to promote rigorous, repeatable and reproducible science. In spite of this, the body of literature that accounts for the sex of participants in human locomotion studies is small and often produces controversial results. Here, we investigated the modular organization of muscle activation patterns for human locomotion using the concept of muscle synergies with a double purpose: i) uncover possible sex-specific characteristics of motor control and ii) assess whether these are maintained in older age. We recorded electromyographic activities from 13 ipsilateral muscles of the lower limb in young and older adults of both sexes walking (young and old) and running (young) on a treadmill. The data set obtained from the 215 participants was elaborated through non-negative matrix factorization to extract the time-independent (i.e., motor modules) and time-dependent (i.e., motor primitives) coefficients of muscle synergies. We found sparse sex-specific modulations of motor control. Motor modules showed a different contribution of hip extensors, knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors in various synergies. Motor primitives were wider (i.e., lasted longer) in males in the propulsion synergy for walking (but only in young and not in older adults) and in the weight acceptance synergy for running. Moreover, the complexity of motor primitives was similar in younger adults of both sexes, but lower in older females as compared to older males. In essence, our results revealed the existence of small but defined sex-specific differences in the way humans control locomotion and that these strategies are not entirely maintained in older age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Testing the perilesional neuroplastic recruitment hypothesis in aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Objective: A prominent theory proposes that neuroplastic recruitment of perilesional tissue supports aphasia recovery, especially when language-capable cortex is spared by smaller lesions. This theory has rarely been tested directly, and findings have been inconclusive. Here, we test the perilesional plasticity hypothesis using two fMRI tasks in two groups of stroke survivors. Methods: Two cohorts totaling 84 chronic left-hemisphere stroke survivors with prior aphasia diagnosis, and 80 control participants underwent fMRI using either a naming task or a reliable semantic decision task. Individualized perilesional tissue was defined by dilating anatomical lesions, and language regions were defined using meta-analyses. Mixed modeling examined differences in activity between groups. Relationships with lesion size and aphasia severity were examined. Results: Stroke survivors exhibited reduced activity in perilesional language tissue relative to controls in both tasks. Although a few cortical regions exhibited greater activity irrespective of distance from the lesion, or only when distant from the lesion, no regions exhibited increased activity only when near the lesion. Larger lesions were associated with reduced language activity irrespective of distance from the lesion. Using the reliable fMRI task, reduced language activity related to aphasia severity independent of lesion size. Interpretation: We find no evidence for neuroplastic recruitment of perilesional tissue in aphasia beyond its typical role in language. Rather, our findings are consistent with alternative hypotheses that left-hemisphere activation changes during recovery relate to normalization of language network dysfunction and possibly recruitment of alternate cortical processors. These findings clarify left-hemisphere neuroplastic mechanisms supporting language recovery after stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IGF-1 Differentially Modulates Glutamate-Induced Toxicity and Stress in Cells of the Neurogliovascular Unit</a></h4>

              
                The age-related reduction in circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is associated with increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases in advanced age. Numerous reports highlight behavioral and physiological deficits in blood-brain barrier function and neurovascular communication when IGF-1 levels are low. Administration of exogenous IGF- 1 reduces the extent of tissue damage and sensorimotor deficits in animal models of ischemic stroke, highlighting the critical role of IGF-1 as a regulator of neurovascular health. The beneficial effects of IGF-1 in the nervous system are often attributed to direct actions on neurons; however, glial cells and the cerebrovasculature are also modulated by IGF-1, and systemic reductions in circulating IGF-1 likely influence the viability and function of the entire neuro-glio-vascular unit. We recently observed that reduced IGF-1 led to impaired glutamate handling in astrocytes. Considering glutamate excitotoxicity is one of the main drivers of neurodegeneration following ischemic stroke, the age-related loss of IGF-1 may also compromise neural function indirectly by altering the function of supporting glia and vasculature. In this study, we assess and compare the effects of IGF-1 signaling on glutamate-induced toxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-produced oxidative stress in primary neuron, astrocyte, and brain microvascular endothelial cell cultures. Our findings verify that neurons are highly susceptible to excitotoxicity, in comparison to astrocytes or endothelial cells, and that a prolonged reduction in IGFR activation increases the extent of toxicity. Moreover, prolonged IGFR inhibition increased the susceptibility of astrocytes to glutamate-induced toxicity and lessened their ability to protect neurons from excitotoxicity. Thus, IGF-1 promotes neuronal survival by acting directly on neurons and indirectly on astrocytes. Despite increased resistance to excitotoxic death, both astrocytes and cerebrovascular endothelial cells exhibit acute increases in glutamate-induced ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction when IGFR is inhibited at the time of glutamate stimulation. Together these data highlight that each cell type within the neuro-glio-vascular unit differentially responds to stress when IGF-1 signaling was impaired. Therefore, the reductions in circulating IGF-1 observed in advanced age are likely detrimental to the health and function of the entire neuro-glio-vascular unit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of Functional Connectome Gradients during Childhood and Adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Connectome mapping studies have documented a principal primary-to-transmodal gradient in the adult brain network, capturing a functional spectrum which ranges from perception and action to abstract cognition. However, how this gradient pattern develops and whether its development is linked to cognitive growth, topological reorganization, and gene expression profiles remain largely unknown. Using longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 305 children (ages 6-14), we describe substantial changes in the primary-to-transmodal gradient between childhood and adolescence, including emergence as the principal gradient, expansion of global topography, and focal tuning in primary and default-mode regions. These gradient changes are mediated by developmental changes in network integration and segregation, and are associated with abstract processing functions such as working memory and expression levels of calcium ion regulated exocytosis, synaptic transmission, and axon and synapse part related genes. Our findings have implications for understanding connectome maturation principles in normal development and developmental disorders.

                The quantification of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates has emerged as a promising biomarker for synucleinopathies. Assays that amplify and detect such aggregates have revealed the presence of seeding-competent species in biosamples of patients diagnosed with Parkinsons disease. However, multiple species such as oligomers and amyloid fibrils, are formed during the aggregation of -synuclein and these species are likely to co-exist in biological samples and thus it remains unclear which species(s) are contributing to the signal detected in seeding assays. To identify which species can be detected in seeding assays, recombinant oligomers and preformed fibrils were produced and purified to characterise their individual biochemical and seeding potential. Here, we used single molecule spectroscopy to track the formation and purification of oligomers and fibrils at the single particle level and compare their respective seeding potential in an amplification assay. Single molecule detection validates that size-exclusion chromatography efficiently separates oligomers from fibrils. Oligomers were found to be seeding-competent but our results reveal that their seeding behaviour is very different compared to preformed fibrils in our amplification assay. Overall, our data suggest that even a low number of preformed fibrils present in biosamples are likely to dominate the response in seeding assays.

                While inflammation has been implicated in the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms, the role of immune attenuation via sympathetic modulation in psychopathology remains unclear. Here, this study aimed to assess {beta}2-agonist clenbuterol (CBL) as a promising agent to model adrenergic-induced immune response following ex vivo immune activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Relationships between CBL-modulated cytokine levels and symptom measures were then explored. Adolescents were evaluated with semi-structure interviews and self-reported depression, anxiety, and anhedonia levels. Fasting whole-blood samples were collected and stimulated with LPS in the presence and absence of CBL for 6 hours, with supernatants being subjected to Luminex multiplex assay for 41 cytokines. Cytokine levels between conditions were compared using Bonferroni-corrected nonparametric tests. Exploratory factor analysis reduced 41 cytokines into fewer factors in each experimental condition, and their relationships with psychiatric symptoms were examined with Spearman correlations controlling for age, sex, and BMI. Data from 130 participants (15.25 {+/-} 2.16 years old, 59% female) were analyzed. 10 cytokines were significantly affected by CBL treatment compared to LPS alone. LPS+CBL factor 3 significantly correlated with both anticipatory (rho = -0.39, p = 7.4 x 10-5) and consummatory anhedonia (rho = -0.36, p = 3.3 x 10-4), and these correlations remained significant when controlling additionally for depression. There were no significant associations between immune factors with depression or anxiety severity. Findings support our hypothesis that clenbuterol attenuates inflammatory effects thought to underlie psychiatric conditions in youth. Using a data-driven analytic method, distinctive relationships between CBL-affected cytokines and dimensional anhedonia were reported, further elucidating the role of {beta}2-agonism in adolescent affective symptomatology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular Changes in Prader-Willi Syndrome Neurons Reveals Clues About Increased Autism Susceptibility.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hormonal dysregulation, obesity, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Most PWS cases are caused by paternal interstitial deletions of 15q11.2-q13.1, while a smaller number of cases are caused by chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (PW-UPD). Children with PW-UPD are at higher risk for developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than the neurotypical population. In this study, we used expression analysis of PW-UPD neurons to try to identify the molecular cause for increased autism risk. Methods: Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) from neurotypical control and PWS subjects were differentiated to neurons for mRNA sequencing. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts among all groups were identified. Downstream protein analysis including immunocytochemistry and immunoblots were performed to confirm the transcript level data and pathway enrichment findings. Results: We identified 9 transcripts outside of the PWS critical region (15q11.2-q13.1) that may contribute to core PWS phenotypes. Moreover, we discovered a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in the PW-UPD +ASD group. We also found decreased mitochondrial abundance along with mitochondrial aggregates in the cell body and neural projections of +ASD neurons. Conclusions: The 9 transcripts we identified common to all PWS subtypes may reveal PWS specific defects during neurodevelopment. Importantly, we found a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in PW-UPD +ASD neurons versus control and other PWS subtypes. We then confirmed mitochondrial defects in neurons from individuals with PWS at the cellular level. Quantification of this phenotype supports our hypothesis that the increased incidence of ASD in PW-UPD subjects may arise from mitochondrial defects in developing neurons.

	<p>Although the issue has been repeatedly explored, data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s sleep quality are inconsistent. To clarify these discrepancies, here we investigate possible age-related differences. During the lockdown, 112 parents of toddlers (0–3 years, N = 61) and pre-schoolers (4–5 years, n = 51) completed an online survey including the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Sleep-related items required an additional retrospective judgment, referring to the pre-pandemic period. During the lockdown, sleep schedules were delayed in both age groups whereas sleep quality (CSHQ total scores) improved in pre-schoolers but not in toddlers. Between-groups comparisons revealed that, prior to the lockdown, pre-schoolers showed worse sleep quality than toddlers, whereas this difference disappeared during home confinement. Also, pre-schoolers’ sleep timing was advanced before the lockdown and delayed during the lockdown relative to toddlers’. Our data highlight a significant modulation of age on the impact of the pandemic crisis on sleep, with pre-schoolers experiencing greater effects than toddlers. This profile suggests that factors affecting sleep features have different weights at different ages: sleep patterns would be mainly determined by developmental factors (i.e., biological drive) in younger children, whereas environmental factors (e.g., major lifestyle changes) would have a stronger effect on older ones.</p>

	<p>RNA therapies using RNA editing and interference are currently being developed for neurological diseases. The CRISPR-Cas13 system, based on bacterial enzymes, holds great promise for developing efficient tools for RNA therapies. However, neurotoxic activity has been reported for Cas13a, and recent studies have reported toxic effects of PspCas13b and RfxCas13d during zebrafish and Drosophila embryonic development. It is important to investigate the safety of these bacterial enzymes in the context of the nervous system and neuronal development. In this study, we used mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells as a complex neuron type to test for the potential neurotoxic actions of RfxCas13d and PspCas13b. We found that PspCas13b significantly impeded the dendritic development of cultured Purkinje cells, similar to the neurotoxic action of Cas13a. In contrast, RfxCas13d did not exhibit a significant inhibition of dendritic development. A similar trend was found for axonal outgrowth. These results suggest varying neurotoxic properties for different Cas13 ortholog enzymes. We call for more studies to investigate, and possibly mitigate, the neurotoxicity of Cas13 proteins in order to improve the safety of the CRISPR-Cas13 system for RNA therapies.</p>

	<p>Rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in situations with emotional valence, and USVs have also been proposed as a marker for memories conditioned to those situations. This study investigated whether USV emissions can predict and/or be associated with the behavior of rats in tests that evaluate unconditioned memory. To this end, rats were subjected to “tickling”, a procedure of heterospecific play that has emotional valence and elicits the emission of USVs, and afterwards evaluated in the novel object recognition test (NOR) and in the single trial continuous spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) test in a Y-maze. The number of 22-kHz USVs (aversive) and 50-kHz USVs (appetitive) emitted in response to tickling and during NOR and SAB tests were scored, and the correlations among them and with rats’ behavior evaluated. Rats emitted 50-kHz USVs, but not 22-kHz USVs, during the NOR and SAB tests, and such calling behavior was not linked with the behavioral readouts indicative of memory function in either test. However, rats that prevalently emitted 22-kHz USVs in response to tickling displayed an impaired NOR performance. These findings suggest that measuring the emission of USVs could be of interest in studies of unconditioned memory, at least with regard to 22-kHz USVs.</p>

	<p>Although motor coordination and imitation are important factors affecting motor skill learning, few studies have examined the relationship between them in healthy adults. In order to address this in the present study, we used fNIRS to analyze the relationship between motor coordination and imitation in college students. Our results showed that: (1) motor coordination in female students was positively correlated with the average time taken to perform an imitation; (2) the mean imitation time was negatively correlated with the activation level of the supplementary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and angular gyrus of the mirror neuron system; (3) motor coordination in female students moderated mirror neuron system (MNS) activation and imitation. For women with low rather than high motor coordination, higher MNS activation was associated with a stronger imitation ability. These results demonstrate that motor coordination in female students is closely related to action imitation, and that it moderates the activation of the MNS, as measured via fNIRS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-Type Specific Responses to Associative Learning in the Primary Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be a critical site for movement initiation and motor learning. Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue-reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both cue and reward stimuli, and their response properties undergo cell-type specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs' responses became more reliable to the cue stimulus, while VIP-INs' responses became more reliable to the reward stimulus. PNs only showed robust response to the novel reward stimulus, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-IN responses emerged and became more reliable to both conditioned cue and reward stimuli after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transmit Field Bias Correction of T1w/T2w Myelin Maps</a></h4>

              
                T1-weighted divided by T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) myelin maps were initially developed for neuroanatomical analyses such as identifying cortical areas, but they are increasingly used in statistical comparisons across individuals and groups with other variables of interest. Existing T1w/T2w myelin maps contain residual radiofrequency transmit field (B1+) biases, which may be correlated with these variables of interest, leading to potentially spurious results. Here we propose multiple methods for correcting these transmit field biases using either explicit measures of the transmit field or alternatively a  pseudo-transmit approach that is highly correlated with the transmit field. We find that the resulting corrected T1w/T2w myelin maps are both better neuroanatomical measures (e.g., for use in cross-species comparisons), and more appropriate for statistical comparisons across individuals and groups (e.g., sex, age, or body-mass-index). We recommend that investigators who use the T1w/T2w approach for mapping cortical myelin use these B1+ transmit field corrected myelin maps going forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Orientations: a Discrete Geometry Model</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, many neuronal ensembles are involved in representing spatial structure of the environment. In particular, there exist cells that encode the animal's location and cells that encode head direction. A number of studies have addressed properties of the spatial maps produced by these two populations of neurons, mainly by establishing correlations between their spiking parameters and geometric characteristics of the animal's environments. The question remains however, how the brain may intrinsically combine the direction and the location information into a unified spatial framework that enables animals' orientation. Below we propose a model of such a framework, using ideas and constructs from algebraic topology and synthetic affine geometry.

                A common approach to interpreting spiking activity is based on identifying the firing fields---regions in physical or configuration spaces that elicit responses of neurons. Common examples include hippocampal place cells that fire at preferred locations in the navigated environment, head direction cells that fire at preferred orientations of the animal's head, view cells that respond to preferred spots in the visual field, etc. In all these cases, firing fields were discovered empirically, by trial and error. We argue that the existence and a number of properties of the firing fields can be established theoretically, through topological analyses of the neuronal spiking activity.

                Western Pacific Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinsonism-dementia Complex (ALS-PDC) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to the traditional consumption of cycad seeds by the Chamorro people of Guam. Little is known about the etiological role of cycad toxin in ALS-PDC. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were derived from age- and sex-matched affected and unaffected patient lymphoid cells then differentiated into cerebral organoids. After three months, the ALS-PDC affected organoids were smaller, their neurons had less extensive neurite outgrowth, and the organoids had more reactive astrocytes and M1 microglia, fewer resting and M2 microglia, and more open extracellular space. Most of these phenomena could be recapitulated by exposing unaffected organoids to {beta}-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA), a toxic amino acid produced by cyanobacteria living with cycad plants. Furthermore, ALS-PDC affected organoids exhibited an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to BMAA exposure via activation of caspase1/NLRP3 inflammasome. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the organoids showed that the most down-regulated pathways were taurine, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; protein digestion; and absorption. The most down-regulated biological processes were type I interferon signaling, regulation of neuron differentiation and extracellular matrix organization. Our results suggested that the etiology of ALS-PDC is due to metabolic disorders that shifted microglia to a more pro-inflammatory M1 state instead of a non-inflammatory, repairing M2 state, which exacerbated inflammation and reduced extracellular matrix strength. Supplementation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) to ALS-PDC affected organoids increased the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) and restored M2 microglia populations and extracellular matrix organization. Organoids containing networks of neurons, astrocytes, microglia derived from iPSC with our protocol provides an excellent cellular model for neurodegenerative disease modeling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The degree of context un/familiarity impacts the emotional feeling and preaware cardiac-brain activity: a study with emotionally salient naturalistic paradigm using DENS Dataset</a></h4>

              
                Emotion experiments with naturalistic paradigms are emerging and giving new insights into dynamic brain activity. Context familiarity is considered as an important dimensions of emotion processing by appraisal theorists. However, how the context un/familiarity of the naturalistic stimuli influences the central and autonomic activity is not probed yet [check it]. Hence, we tried to address this issue in this work by breaking it down into three questions. 1) What is the relation between context un/familiarity with the neural correlates of self-assessment affective dimensions viz. valence and arousal; 2) the influence of context un/familiarity in cardiac-brain mutual interaction during emotion processing; 3.) brain network reorganization to accommodate the degree of context familiarity. We found that the less-context familiarity is primarily attributed to negative emotion feeling mediated by lack of predictability of sensory experience. Whereas, with high-context familiarity, both positive and negative emotions are felt. For less-context familiarity, the arousal activity is negatively correlated with EEG power. In addition, the cardiac activity for both high and less context familiarity is modulated before the reported self-awareness of emotional feeling. The correlation of cortical regions with cardiac activity and connectivity patterns reveals that ECG is modulated by salient feature during pre-awareness and correlates with AIC and conceptual hub in high-familiarity. Whereas, for the low familiarity, the cardiac activity is correlated with the exteroceptive sensory regions. In addition, we found that OFC and dmPFC have high connectivity with less-context familiarity, whereas AIC has high connectivity with high-context familiarity. To the best of our knowledge, the context familiarity and its influence on cardiac and brain activity have never been reported with a naturalistic paradigm. Hence, this study significantly contributes to understanding automatic processing of emotions by analyzing the effect of context un/familiarity on affective feelings, the dynamics of cardiac-brain mutual interaction, and the brain's effective connectivity during pre-awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct progressions of neuronal activity changes underlie the formation and consolidation of a gustatory associative memory</a></h4>

              
                Acquiring new memories is a multi-stage process. Ample of studies have convincingly demonstrated that initially acquired memories are labile, and only stabilized by later consolidation processes. These multiple phases of memory formation are known to involve modification of both cellular excitability and synaptic connectivity, which in turn change neuronal activity at both the single neuron and ensemble levels. However, the specific mapping between the known phases of memory and the observed changes in neuronal activity remains unknown. Here we address this unknown in the context of conditioned taste aversion learning by continuously tracking gustatory cortex (GC) neuronal taste responses from alert rats in the 24 hours following a taste-malaise pairing. We found that the progression of neuronal activity changes in the GC depend on the neuronal organizational level. The population response changed continuously; these changes, however, were only reflected in the population mean amplitude during the acquisition and consolidation phases, and in the known quickening of the ensemble state dynamics after the time of consolidation. Together our results demonstrate how complex dynamics in different representational level of cortical activity underlie the formation and stabilization of memory within the cortex.

                Recent studies using single-cell RNA-seq have revealed cellular heterogeneity in the developing mammalian cerebellum, yet the regulatory logic underlying this cellular diversity remains to be elucidated. Using integrated single-cell RNA and ATAC analyses, we resolved developmental trajectories of cerebellar progenitors and identified putative trans- and cis-elements that control cell state transition. We reverse-engineered gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of each cerebellar cell type. Through in silico simulations and in vivo experiments, we validated the efficacy of GRN analyses and uncovered the molecular control of a newly identified stem zone, the posterior transitory zone (PTZ), which contains multipotent progenitors for granule neurons, Bergmann glia, and choroid plexus epithelium. Importantly, we showed that perturbing cell fate specification of PTZ progenitors causes posterior cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, the most common cerebellar birth defect in humans. Our study provides a foundation for comprehensive studies of developmental programs of the mammalian cerebellum.

                Defining reference models for population variation, and the ability to study individual deviations is essential for understanding inter-individual variability and its relation to the onset and progression of medical conditions. In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2-100) and use normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1,985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision making.

                Background and Purpose: Gpr19 encodes an evolutionarily conserved orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with no established physiological function in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of Gpr19 in the circadian clock system. Experimental Approach: We examined whether and how the master circadian clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) express Gpr19. By analysing Gpr19-deficient (Gpr19-/-) mice, we asked whether Gpr19 has a role in modulating free-running period and light resetting capacity of the circadian clock. Key Results: Compared with the known common core clock genes, Gpr19 was identified to show several distinct yet limited features related to the circadian clock. Gpr19 mRNA was mainly expressed in the middle-to-dorsal region of the SCN. A conserved cAMP-responsive element within the Gpr19 promoter drove the circadian expression of Gpr19. Gpr19-/- mice exhibited a prolonged circadian period and a delayed initiation of daily locomotor activity in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Gpr19 deficiency caused the downregulation of several genes that normally peak during the night, including Bmal1 and Gpr176. Gpr19-/- mice had a reduced capacity for phase shift to early subjective night light. The defect was only observed for phase-delay, but not phase-advance, and accompanied by reduced response of c-Fos expression in the dorsal region of the SCN, while apparently normal in the ventral part of the SCN, in Gpr19-/- mice. Conclusion and Implications: Gpr19 is an SCN-enriched orphan GPCR with a distinct role in circadian regulation and thus may be a potential target for alleviating circadian clock disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task space exploration improves adaptation after incompatible virtual surgeries</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn new motor skills, a process that requires novel muscle activity patterns. Muscle synergies may simplify the generation of muscle patterns through the selection of a small number of synergy combinations. Learning new motor skills may then be achieved by acquiring novel muscle synergies. In a previous study, we used myoelectric control to construct virtual surgeries that altered the mapping from muscle activity to cursor movements. After compatible virtual surgeries, which could be compensated by recombining subject-specific muscle synergies, participants adapted quickly. In contrast, after incompatible virtual surgeries, which could not be compensated by recombining existing synergies, participants explored new muscle patterns, but failed to adapt. Here, we tested whether task space exploration can promote learning of novel muscle synergies, required to overcome an incompatible surgery. Participants performed the same reaching task as in our previous study, but with more time to complete each trial, thus allowing for exploration. We found an improvement in trial success after incompatible virtual surgeries. Remarkably, improvements in movement direction accuracy after incompatible surgeries occurred faster for corrective movements than for the initial movement, suggesting that learning of new synergies is more effective when used for feedback control. Moreover, reaction time was significantly higher after incompatible than after compatible virtual surgeries, suggesting an increased use of an explicit adaptive strategy to overcome incompatible surgeries. Taken together, these results indicate that exploration is important for skill learning and suggest that human participants, with sufficient time can learn new muscle synergies.

                Exosomes are secreted by every cell in our body under both physiological and pathological conditions. They travel in the blood, CSF, and all studied biofluids. Their biological roles have been reported to include delivery of important physiological cargo between organs and cells, clearance of toxic proteins; maintenance of cellular stasis, and the propagation of disease pathology. In the case of Alzheimers disease (AD) exosomes have been shown to carry pathological proteins such as amyloid, yet the specificity of this association of amyloid and exosomes is unclear. To address this deficiency, we utilized Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) to measure the binding of amyloid to exosomes. Here we report that Ab40 and Ab42 bind to exosomes in a saturable and endothermic manner, a phenomenon not observed with the scrambled versions of either peptide. This points to this interaction being more specific than previously understood, and to amyloid associated with exosomes as an important pool of this peptide in the plasma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Columnar processing of border ownership in primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                To understand a visual scene, the brain segregates figures from background by assigning borders to foreground objects. Neurons in primate visual cortex encode which object owns a border (border ownership), but the underlying circuitry is not understood. Here we used multielectrode probes to record from border ownership selective units in different layers in macaque visual area V4 to study the laminar organization and timing of border ownership selectivity. We find that border ownership selectivity occurs first in deep layer units, in contrast to spike latency for small stimuli in the classical receptive field. Units on the same penetration typically share the preferred side of border ownership, also across layers, similar to orientation preference. Units are often border ownership selective for a range of border orientations, where the preferred sides of border ownership are systematically organized in visual space. Together our data reveal a columnar organization of border ownership in V4 where the earliest border ownership signals are not simply inherited from upstream areas, but computed by neurons in deep layers, and may thus be part of signals fed back to upstream cortical areas or the oculomotor system early after stimulus onset. The finding that preferred border ownership is clustered and can cover a wide range of spatially contiguous locations, suggests that the asymmetric context integrated by these neurons is provided in a systematically clustered manner, possibly through corticocortical feedback and horizontal connections.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual association cortex links cues with conjunctions of reward and locomotor contexts</a></h4>

              
                Postrhinal cortex (POR) and neighboring lateral visual association areas are necessary for identifying objects and interpreting them in specific contexts, but how POR neurons encode the same object across contexts remains unclear. Here, we imaged excitatory neurons in mouse POR across tens of days throughout initial cue-reward learning and reversal learning. As such, neurons were tracked across sessions/trials where the same cue was rewarded or unrewarded, during both locomotor and stationary contexts. Surprisingly, a large class of POR neurons were minimally cue-driven prior to learning. After learning, distinct clusters within this class responded selectively to a given cue when presented in a specific conjunction of reward and locomotion contexts. In addition, another class involved clusters of neurons whose cue responses were more transient, insensitive to reward learning, and adapted over thousands of presentations. These two classes of POR neurons may support context-dependent interpretation and context-independent identification of sensory cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal responses to focused ultrasound are gated by pre-stimulation brain rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Background: Owing to its high spatial resolution and penetration depth, transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) is one of the most promising approaches to non-invasive neuromodulation. Identifying the impact of the stimulation waveform and endogenous neural activity on neuromodulation outcome is critical to harnessing the potential of tFUS. Objective: Here we tested a new form of tFUS where the amplitude of the ultrasonic waveform is modulated at a rate much slower than the operating frequency. Moreover, we sought to identify the relationship between pre-stimulation neural activity and the neuronal response to tFUS. Methods: We applied three minutes of amplitude modulated (AM) tFUS at 40 Hz to the rat hippocampus while recording local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) from the sonicated region. To assess the role of AM, we also tested continuous-wave (CW) stimulation. Results: AM tFUS reduced firing rate during and immediately after stimulation. On the other hand, CW tFUS produced an acute firing rate increase that was abolished after sonication. For both waveforms, firing rate changes were stronger in units exhibiting high baseline LFP power, particularly in the gamma band (30-250 Hz). The neuromodulatory effect was also influenced by the prevalence of sharp wave ripples (SWR) during the pre-stimulation period, with firing rates modulated by up to 33% at units showing frequent baseline SWR. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that AM and CW tFUS produce qualitatively different neuronal outcomes, and that baseline rhythms may effectively gate the response to tFUS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The looping lullaby: closed-loop neurostimulation decreases sleepers' sensitivity to environmental noise</a></h4>

              
                Study Objective: Sleep is critical for physical and mental health. However, sleep disruption due to noise is a growing problem, causing long-lasting distress and fragilizing entire populations mentally and physically. Here for the first time, we tested an innovative and non-invasive potential countermeasure for sleep disruptions due to noise. Methods: We developed a new, modeling-based, closed-loop acoustic neurostimulation procedure (CLNS) to precisely phase-lock stimuli to slow oscillations (SO). We used CLNS to align, soft sound pulses to the start of the SO positive deflection to boost SO and sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Participants underwent three overnight EEG recordings. The first night served to determine each participant 's individual noise arousal threshold. The remaining two nights occurred in counterbalanced order: in the Disturbing night, loud, real-life noises were repeatedly presented; in the Intervention night, similar loud noises were played while using the CLNS to boost SO. All experimental manipulations were performed in the first three hours of sleep; participants slept undisturbed for the rest of the night. Results: In contrast to the Disturbing night, the probability of arousals caused by noise was significantly decreased in the Intervention night. Moreover, the CLNS intervention increased NREM duration and sleep spindle power across the night. Conclusions: These results show that our CLNS procedure can effectively protect sleep from disruptions caused by noise. Remarkably, even in the presence of loud environmental noise, CLNS ' soft and precisely timed sound pulses played a beneficial role in protecting sleep continuity. This represents the first successful attempt at using CLNS in a noisy environment.

                Recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-insulin-like growth factor-2 (rhNAGLU-IGF2) is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for Sanfilippo B, a lysosomal storage disease. The fusion protein with IGF2 permits binding to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, because recombinant human NAGLU (rhNAGLU) is poorly mannose 6-phosphorylated. We previously administered rhNAGLU-IGF2 intracerebroventricularly to Sanfilippo B mice. We demonstrated therapeutic restoration of NAGLU, normalization of lysosomal storage, and improvement in markers of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Here, we studied intracerebroventricular rhNAGLU-IGF2 in murine and canine Sanfilippo B to determine potential effects on the behavioral phenotype and survival. Heparan sulfate (HS) levels in brain and heart were reduced following treatment with rhNAGLU-IGF2 or rhNAGLU. Treated mice showed improvement in disease markers such as beta-hexosaminidase, CD68, and LAMP1. We found a more normal number of stretch attend postures, a fear pose, in mice treated with either rhNAGLU or rhNAGLU-IGF2 vs vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice on elevated plus maze testing (p<0.001). We found a more normal dark/light activity pattern in Sanfilippo B mice treated with rhNAGLU-IGF2 compared to vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice (p=0.025). We found a 61% increase in survival in Sanfilippo B mice treated with rhNAGLU-IGF2 (mean 53d, median 48d) compared to vehicle-treated Sanfilippo B mice (mean 33d, median 37d; p<0.001). In canine Sanfilippo B, we found that rhNAGLU-IGF2 administered into cerebrospinal fluid normalized heparan sulfate and beta-hexosaminidase activity in gray and white matter brain regions. Proteomics analysis of cerebral cortex showed restoration of protein concentrations in pathways relevant to cognitive function, synapse, and the lysosome. Treatment with rhNAGLU-IGF2 may improve the phenotype of Sanfilippo B disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal dynamics of neural responses in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including sub-additive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in contrast, duration, and inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Aggregating data across patients yielded 88 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1-V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several non-linear features: peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations; the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs; response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model comprised of a small set of canonical neuronal operations: linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex, and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.

                In chemical sensation, multiple models have been proposed to explain how odors are represented by patterns of neuronal activity in the olfactory cortex. One hypothesis is that the identity of combinations of active neurons within specific sniff-related time windows are critical for encoding information about odors. Another model is that patterns of neural activity evolve across time and it is this temporal structure that is essential for encoding odor information. Interestingly, we found that top-down feedback to the olfactory bulb dictates what information is transmitted to the olfactory cortex by switching between these two strategies. Using a detailed model of the early olfactory system, we demonstrate that feedback control of inhibitory granule cells in the main olfactory bulb influences the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in mitral cells, thereby restructuring the firing patterns of piriform cortical cells across time. This resulted in performance gains in both the accuracy and reaction time of odor discrimination tasks. These findings lead us to propose a new framework for early olfactory computation, one in which top-down feedback to the bulb flexibly controls the temporal structure of neural activity in olfactory cortex, allowing the early olfactory system to dynamically switch between two distinct models of coding.

                Intracortical, horizontal connections seem ideally suited to contribute to cortical processing by spreading information across cortical space and coordinating activity between distant cortical sites. In sensory systems experiments have implicated horizontal connections in the generation of receptive fields and have in turn led to computational models of receptive field generation that rely on the contribution of horizontal connections. Testing the contribution of horizontal connections at the mesoscopic level has been difficult due to the lack of a suitable method to observe the activity of intracortical horizontal connections. Here, we develop such a method based on the analysis of the relative residues of the cortical laminar current source density reconstructions. In the auditory cortex of Mongolian gerbils, the method is then tested by manipulating the contribution of horizontal connections by surgical dissection. Our results indicate that intracortical horizontal connections contribute to the frequency-tuning of mesoscopic cortical patches. Futhermore, we dissociated a type of cortical gamma oscillation based on horizontal connections between mesoscopic patches from gamma oscillations locally generated within mesoscopic patches. The data further imply that global and local coordination of activity during sensory stimulation occur in a low and high gamma frequency band, respectively. Taken together the present data demonstrate that intracortical horizontal connections play an important role in generating cortical feature tuning and coordinate neuronal oscillations across cortex.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the first use of cross-bispectrum to reconstruct a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. An increase of within-band FC in AD is observed in low-frequency bands using both methods. Bispectrum also detects multiple cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD in delta-theta coupling. An increased importance of low-frequency coupling and decreased importance of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD. Integration properties of AD networks are more vulnerable than HC, while the segregation property is maintained in AD. Moreover, the segregation property of {gamma} is less vulnerable in AD, suggesting the shift of importance from high-frequency activity towards low-frequency components. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD. Moreover, the results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using bispectrum to reconstruct FC networks.

                The whiskers of rodents are a key sensory organ that provides critical tactile information for animal navigation and object exploration throughout life. Previous work has explored the developmental sensory-driven activation of the primary sensory cortex processing whisker information (wS1), also called barrel cortex. This body of work has shown that the barrel cortex is already activated by sensory stimuli during the first post-natal week. However, it is currently unknown when over the course of development these stimuli begin being processed by higher order cortical areas, such as secondary whisker somatosensory area (wS2). Here we investigate for the first time the developmental engagement of wS2 by sensory stimuli and the emergence of cortico-cortical communication from wS1 to wS2. Using in vivo wide-field imaging and electrophysiological recordings in control and conditional knock-out mice we find that wS1 and wS2 are able to process bottom-up information coming from the thalamus already right after birth. We identify that it is only at the end of the first post-natal week that wS1 begins to provide excitation into wS2, a connection which begins to acquire feed-forward inhibition characteristics after the second post-natal week. Therefore, we have uncovered a developmental window during which excitatory versus inhibitory functional connectivity between wS1 and wS2 takes place.

The dorsal hippocampus (dHP) has been involved in memory consolidation, which is the stabilization of a trace from short-term (STM) to long-term memory (LTM), as well as in the ability to process high information load. However, how memory load influences memory consolidation, and the underlying neural mechanisms, are yet unknown. To address this question, we used male and female mice that, despite having in our Different Object recognition Task (DOT) the same STM capacity of 6 objects, spontaneously show differences in the number of objects directly transferred to LTM, when tested over longer delays. Males memorize all 6 objects encoded, while females remember only up to 4, both at 1 and 24 h delays. Interestingly, males activate more the dHP (as measured by c-Fos expression), while females the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE). Optogenetic inhibition of the RE-dHP pathway during off-line memory consolidation favors 6-object LTM retention in females by removing inhibitory control over dHP activation, while chemogenetic RE-activation impairs it in males. Our data represent a first demonstration of a sub-cortical control of dHP recruitment, that might underlie its sex-dependent activation during incidental memory, with potential also for clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Classification and genetic targeting of cell types in the primary taste and premotor center of the Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits carry out complex computations that allow animals to evaluate food, select mates, move toward attractive stimuli, and move away from threats. In insects, the subesophageal zone (SEZ) is a brain region that receives gustatory, pheromonal, and mechanosensory inputs and contributes to the control of diverse behaviors, including feeding, grooming, and locomotion. Despite its importance in sensorimotor transformations, the study of SEZ circuits has been hindered by limited knowledge of the underlying diversity of SEZ neurons. Here, we generate a collection of split-GAL4 lines that provides precise genetic targeting of 138 different SEZ cell types in adult D. melanogaster, comprising approximately one third of all SEZ neurons. We characterize the single cell anatomy of these neurons and find that they cluster by morphology into six supergroups that organize the SEZ into discrete anatomical domains. We find that the majority of local SEZ interneurons are not classically polarized, suggesting rich local processing, whereas SEZ projection neurons tend to be classically polarized, conveying information to a limited number of higher brain regions. This study provides insight into the anatomical organization of the SEZ and generates resources that will facilitate further study of SEZ neurons and their contributions to sensory processing and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring the double-drift illusion with hand tracking</a></h4>

              
                If a gabor pattern drifts in one direction while its internal texture drifts in the orthogonal direction, its perceived position deviates further and further away from its true path. We first evaluated the illusion using manual tracking. Participants followed the gabor with a stylus on a drawing tablet that coincided optically with the horizontal monitor surface. Their hand and the stylus were not visible during the tracking. The magnitude of the tracking illusion corresponded closely to previous perceptual and pointing measures indicating that manual tracking is a valid measure for the illusion. This allowed us to use it in a second experiment to capture the behavior of the illusion as it eventually degrades and breaks down in single trials. Specifically, the deviation of the gabor stops accumulating at some point and either stays at a fixed offset or resets toward the veridical position. To report the perceived trajectory of the gabor, participants drew it after the gabor was removed from the monitor. Resets were detected and analyzed and they suggest that there is a spatial limit beyond which the illusion saturates or resets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overlapping influences shape motor activity during hasty sensorimotor decisions</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. Fifty subjects performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in two contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEP) in nine finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while subjects were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, though this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.
