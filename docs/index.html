                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants (20 female, 14 male) learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation where some features are enhanced over others.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e0163242024?rss=1">A Reconsideration of the Core and Matrix Classification of Thalamocortical Projections</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1998, Jones suggested a classification of thalamocortical projections into core and matrix divisions (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Jones, 1998</cross-ref>). In this classification, core projections are specific, topographical, innervate middle cortical layers, and serve to transmit specific information to the cortex for further analysis; matrix projections, in contrast, are diffuse, much less topographic, innervate upper layers, especially Layer 1, and serve a more global, modulatory function, such as affecting levels of arousal. This classification has proven especially influential in studies of thalamocortical relationships. Whereas it may be the case that a clear subset of thalamocortical connections fit the core motif, since they are specific, topographic, and innervate middle layers, we argue that there is no clear evidence for any single class that encompasses the remainder of thalamocortical connections as is claimed for matrix. Instead, there is great morphological variation in connections made by thalamocortical projections fitting neither a core nor matrix classification. We thus conclude that the core/matrix classification should be abandoned, because its application is not helpful in providing insights into thalamocortical interactions and can even be misleading. As one example of the latter, recent suggestions indicate that core projections are equivalent to first-order thalamic relays (i.e., those that relay subcortical information to the cortex) and matrix to higher-order relays (i.e., those that relay information from one cortical area to another), but available evidence does not support this relationship. All of this points to a need to replace the core/matrix grouping with a more complete classification of thalamocortical projections.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e0588232024?rss=1">Synapse-Specific Trapping of SNARE Machinery Proteins in the Anesthetized Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>General anesthetics disrupt brain network dynamics through multiple pathways, in part through postsynaptic potentiation of inhibitory ion channels as well as presynaptic inhibition of neuroexocytosis. Common clinical general anesthetic drugs, such as propofol and isoflurane, have been shown to interact and interfere with core components of the exocytic release machinery to cause impaired neurotransmitter release. Recent studies however suggest that these drugs do not affect all synapse subtypes equally. We investigated the role of the presynaptic release machinery in multiple neurotransmitter systems under isoflurane general anesthesia in the adult female <I>Drosophila</I> brain using live-cell super&ndash;resolution microscopy and optogenetic readouts of exocytosis and neural excitability. We activated neurotransmitter-specific mushroom body output neurons and imaged presynaptic function under isoflurane anesthesia. We found that isoflurane impaired synaptic release and presynaptic protein dynamics in excitatory cholinergic synapses. In contrast, isoflurane had little to no effect on inhibitory GABAergic or glutamatergic synapses. These results present a distinct inhibitory mechanism for general anesthesia, whereby neuroexocytosis is selectively impaired at excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses remain functional. This suggests a presynaptic inhibitory mechanism that complements the other inhibitory effects of these drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e0953232024?rss=1">Neuroanatomical Substrates of Circuit-Specific Cholinergic Modulation across the Primate Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetylcholine is a robust neuromodulator of the limbic system and a critical regulator of arousal and emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala (AMY) are key limbic structures that are both densely innervated by cholinergic afferents and interact with each other for emotional regulation. The ACC is composed of functionally distinct dorsal (A24), rostral (A32), and ventral (A25) areas that differ in their connections with the AMY. The structural substrates of cholinergic modulation of distinct ACC microcircuits and outputs to AMY are thought to depend on the laminar and subcellular localization of cholinergic receptors. The present study examines the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, m1 and m2, on distinct excitatory and inhibitory neurons and on AMY-targeting projection neurons within ACC areas, via immunohistochemistry and injections of neural tracers into the basolateral AMY in adult rhesus monkeys of both sexes. We found that laminar densities of m1+ and m2+ expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons depended on area and cell type. Among the ACC areas, ventral subgenual ACC A25 exhibited greater m2+ localization on presynaptic inhibitory axon terminals and greater density of m1+ and m2+ expressing AMY-targeting (tracer+) pyramidal neurons. These patterns suggest robust cholinergic disinhibition and potentiation of amygdalar outputs from the limbic ventral ACC, which may be linked to the hyperexcitability of this subgenual ACC area in depression. These findings reveal the anatomical substrate of diverse cholinergic modulation of specific ACC microcircuits and amygdalar outputs that mediate cognitive&ndash;emotional integration and dysfunctions underlying stress and affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Understanding the function of the human brain requires determining basic properties of synaptic transmission in human neurons. One of the most fundamental parameters controlling neurotransmitter release is the presynaptic action potential, but its amplitude and duration remain controversial. Presynaptic action potentials have so far been measured with high temporal resolution only in a limited number of vertebrate but not in human neurons. To uncover properties of human presynaptic action potentials, we exploited recently developed tools to generate human glutamatergic neurons by transient expression of Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) in pluripotent stem cells. During maturation for 3 to 9&nbsp;weeks of culturing in different established media, the proportion of cells with multiple axon initial segments decreased, while the amount of axonal tau protein and neuronal excitability increased. Super-resolution microscopy revealed the alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins, Bassoon and Homer. Synaptic transmission was surprisingly reliable at frequencies of 20, 50, and 100&nbsp;Hz. The synchronicity of synaptic transmission during high-frequency transmission increased during 9&nbsp;weeks of neuronal maturation. To analyze the mechanisms of synchronous high-frequency glutamate release, we developed direct presynaptic patch-clamp recordings from human neurons. The presynaptic action potentials had large overshoots to ~25&nbsp;mV and short durations of ~0.5&nbsp;ms. Our findings show that Ngn2-induced neurons represent an elegant model system allowing for functional, structural, and molecular analyses of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with high spatiotemporal resolution in human neurons. Furthermore, our data predict that glutamatergic transmission is mediated by large and rapid presynaptic action potentials in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Structural differences along the hippocampal long axis are believed to underlie meaningful functional differences. Yet, recent data-driven parcellations of the hippocampus subdivide the hippocampus into a 10-cluster map with anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral, middle, and posterior components. We tested whether task and experience could modulate this clustering using a spatial learning experiment where male and female participants were trained to virtually navigate a novel neighborhood in a Google Street View-like environment. Participants were scanned while navigating routes early in training and after a 2&nbsp;week training period. Using the 10-cluster map as the ideal template, we found that participants who eventually learn the neighborhood well have hippocampal cluster maps consistent with the ideal&mdash;even on their second day of learning&mdash;and their cluster mappings do not deviate over the 2&nbsp;week training period. However, participants who eventually learn the neighborhood poorly begin with hippocampal cluster maps inconsistent with the ideal template, though their cluster mappings may become more stereotypical after the 2&nbsp;week training. Interestingly this improvement seems to be route specific: after some early improvement, when a new route is navigated, participants' hippocampal maps revert back to less stereotypical organization. We conclude that hippocampal clustering is not dependent solely on anatomical structure and instead is driven by a combination of anatomy, task, and, importantly, experience. Nonetheless, while hippocampal clustering can change with experience, efficient navigation depends on functional hippocampal activity clustering in a stereotypical manner, highlighting optimal divisions of processing along the hippocampal anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.</p>

                <p>Despite the known behavioral benefits of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, discrete neural oscillatory events in human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) linked with behavior have not been discovered. This knowledge gap hinders mechanistic understanding of the function of sleep, as well as the development of biophysical models and REM-based causal interventions. We designed a detection algorithm to identify bursts of activity in high-density, scalp EEG within theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) and alpha (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) bands during REM sleep. Across 38 nights of sleep, we characterized the burst events (i.e., count, duration, density, peak frequency, amplitude) in healthy, young male and female human participants (38; 21F) and investigated burst activity in relation to sleep-dependent memory tasks: hippocampal-dependent episodic verbal memory and nonhippocampal visual perceptual learning. We found greater burst count during the more REM-intensive second half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), longer burst duration during the first half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), but no differences across the night in density or power (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05). Moreover, increased alpha burst power was associated with increased overnight forgetting for episodic memory (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we show that increased REM theta burst activity in retinotopically specific regions was associated with better visual perceptual performance. Our work provides a critical bridge between discrete REM sleep events in human scalp EEG that support cognitive processes and the identification of similar activity patterns in animal models that allow for further mechanistic characterization.</p>

                <p>Genetic variants in the <I>apolipoprotein E</I> (<I>APOE</I>) gene affect the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The <I>APOE</I> Christchurch (<I>APOE</I> Ch) variant has been identified as the most prominent candidate for preventing the onset and progression of AD. In this study, we generated isogenic <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> healthy control female iPSCs and induced them into astrocytes. RNA expression analysis revealed the inherent resilience of <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes to induce a reactive state in response to inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cytokine treatment changed astrocytic morphology with more complexity in <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes, but not in <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes, indicating resilience of the rare variant to a reactive state. Interestingly, we observed robust morphological alterations containing more intricate processes when cocultured with iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in which <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes reduced complexity compared with <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes. To assess the impacts of tau propagation effects, we next developed a sophisticated and sensitive assay utilizing cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs, previously generated from donors of both sexes. We showed that <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes effectively mitigated tau propagation within iPSC-derived neurons. This study provides important experimental evidence of the characteristic functions exhibited by <I>APOE3Ch/3Ch</I> astrocytes, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of novel clinical interventions in AD research.</p>

                <p>Faces and bodies are processed in separate but adjacent regions in the primate visual cortex. Yet, the functional significance of dividing the whole person into areas dedicated to its face and body components and their neighboring locations remains unknown. Here we hypothesized that this separation and proximity together with a normalization mechanism generate clutter-tolerant representations of the face, body, and whole person when presented in complex multi-category scenes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a fMRI study, presenting images of a person within a multi-category scene to human male and female participants and assessed the contribution of each component to the response to the scene. Our results revealed a clutter-tolerant representation of the whole person in areas selective for both faces and bodies, typically located at the border between the two category-selective regions. Regions exclusively selective for faces or bodies demonstrated clutter-tolerant representations of their preferred category, corroborating earlier findings. Thus, the adjacent locations of face- and body-selective areas enable a hardwired machinery for decluttering of the whole person, without the need for a dedicated population of person-selective neurons. This distinct yet proximal functional organization of category-selective brain regions enhances the representation of the socially significant whole person, along with its face and body components, within multi-category scenes.</p>

                <p>Reinforcement learning is a theoretical framework that describes how agents learn to select options that maximize rewards and minimize punishments over time. We often make choices, however, to obtain symbolic reinforcers (e.g., money, points) that are later exchanged for primary reinforcers (e.g., food, drink). Although symbolic reinforcers are ubiquitous in our daily lives, widely used in laboratory tasks because they can be motivating, mechanisms by which they become motivating are less understood. In the present study, we examined how monkeys learn to make choices that maximize fluid rewards through reinforcement with tokens. The question addressed here is how the value of a state, which is a function of multiple task features (e.g., the current number of accumulated tokens, choice options, task epoch, trials since the last delivery of primary reinforcer, etc.), drives value and affects motivation. We constructed a Markov decision process model that computes the value of task states given task features to then correlate with the motivational state of the animal. Fixation times, choice reaction times, and abort frequency were all significantly related to values of task states during the tokens task (<I>n</I> = 5 monkeys, three males and two females). Furthermore, the model makes predictions for how neural responses could change on a moment-by-moment basis relative to changes in the state value. Together, this task and model allow us to capture learning and behavior related to symbolic reinforcement.</p>

                <p>The 40&nbsp;Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an oscillatory brain response to periodically modulated auditory stimuli, is a promising, noninvasive physiological biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. The 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR might be amplified by synaptic interactions in cortical circuits, which are, in turn, disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested whether the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the human auditory cortex depends on two key synaptic components of neuronal interactions within cortical circuits: excitation via N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and inhibition via gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled, low-dose pharmacological interventions in the same healthy human participants (13 males, 7 females). All participants exhibited a robust 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in auditory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, under a placebo. The GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor&ndash;agonist lorazepam increased the amplitude of the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR, while no effect was detectable under the NMDA blocker memantine. Our findings indicate that the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the auditory cortex involves synaptic (and likely intracortical) inhibition via the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor, thus highlighting its utility as a mechanistic signature of cortical circuit dysfunctions involving GABAergic inhibition.</p>

                <p>Visual crowding refers to the phenomenon where a target object that is easily identifiable in isolation becomes difficult to recognize when surrounded by other stimuli (distractors). Many psychophysical studies have investigated this phenomenon and proposed alternative models for the underlying mechanisms. One prominent hypothesis, albeit with mixed psychophysical support, posits that crowding arises from the loss of information due to pooled encoding of features from target and distractor stimuli in the early stages of cortical visual processing. However, neurophysiological studies have not rigorously tested this hypothesis. We studied the responses of single neurons in macaque (one male, one female) area V4, an intermediate stage of the object-processing pathway, to parametrically designed crowded displays and texture statistics-matched metameric counterparts. Our investigations reveal striking parallels between how crowding parameters&mdash;number, distance, and position of distractors&mdash;influence human psychophysical performance and V4 shape selectivity. Importantly, we also found that enhancing the salience of a target stimulus could alleviate crowding effects in highly cluttered scenes, and this could be temporally protracted reflecting a dynamical process. Thus, a pooled encoding of nearby stimuli cannot explain the observed responses, and we propose an alternative model where V4 neurons preferentially encode salient stimuli in crowded displays. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude of crowding effects is determined not just by the number of distractors and target&ndash;distractor separation but also by the relative salience of targets versus distractors based on their feature attributes&mdash;the similarity of distractors and the contrast between target and distractor stimuli.</p>

                <p>Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is an inducible NADase that localizes to mitochondria throughout neurons and senses metabolic changes that occur after injury. Minimal proteomic changes are observed upon either SARM1 depletion or activation, suggesting that SARM1 does not exert broad effects on neuronal protein homeostasis. However, whether SARM1 activation occurs throughout the neuron in response to injury and cell stress remains largely unknown. Using a semiautomated imaging pipeline and a custom-built deep learning scoring algorithm, we studied degeneration in both mixed-sex mouse primary cortical neurons and male human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons in response to a number of different stressors. We show that SARM1 activation is differentially restricted to specific neuronal compartments depending on the stressor. Cortical neurons undergo SARM1-dependent axon degeneration after mechanical transection, and SARM1 activation is limited to the axonal compartment distal to the injury site. However, global SARM1 activation following vacor treatment causes both cell body and axon degeneration. Context-specific stressors, such as microtubule dysfunction and mitochondrial stress, induce axonal SARM1 activation leading to SARM1-dependent axon degeneration and SARM1-independent cell body death. Our data reveal that compartment-specific SARM1&ndash;mediated death signaling is dependent on the type of injury and cellular stressor.</p>

                Background The spirochaete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, which causes the infectious disease syphilis, can be spread through sexual contact or perinatal transmission. In recent years, cases of syphilis have increased, especially among individuals engaging in behaviour that makes them more vulnerable (condomless sex and multiple sexual partners). Condylomata acuminata (external genital warts) is one of the most common viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Individuals who are behaviourally vulnerable are also highly prone to two or more STIs. Our case exemplifies the occurrence of two STIs in a young man who was behaviourally vulnerable to acquiring STIs. Case We report a case of a 21-year-old year old heterosexual man presenting with concomitant primary syphilis and genital warts. He presented with a painless genital ulcer and warty growths on his glans penis. Examination showed a painless indurated ulcer and multiple genital warts. Serology was positive for quantitative Venereal disease research laboratory test (1:16 titre). The patient was diagnosed with two concomitant STIs. He was treated as per the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for primary syphilis and podophyllin resin for genital warts. After four weeks, the genital ulcer showed complete healing and there was a significant reduction of genital warts. Conclusions Individuals with multiple sexual partners engaging in sexual activity without the use of prevention tools are at a greater chance of acquiring two or more STIs. To reduce concomitant transmission, preventive measures against genital ulcer diseases like syphilis, herpes, and chancroid, such as early identification and treatment, and condom distribution, must be strengthened as part of national STI prevention. Patients with two or more STIs should be followed regularly to assess the progress of infection and should be offered timely medical treatment.

                Background Tumor budding is defined as a single cell or a cluster of up to five tumor cells at the invasion front of all oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases. Tumor budding is considered as a marker of many important events in oral carcinoma, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and for further prognosis. Methods A total of 30 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed cases of OSCC were retrieved from the archival of the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. After assessing the sections for the presence of tumor budding (TB), it is further categorized into high-intensity TB and low-intensity TB. Results We found a strong association between lymph node metastasis and histopathological grading in the current study. There was no association between TB and a patient’s survival rate. Conclusions This study emphasizes the significance of tumor budding, its relevance to prognosis, and reproducibility, as well as the significance of its evaluation and incorporation into routine surgical pathology practice in the management of OSCC. As a result, we believe that tumor budding is a crucial factor in determining tumor behavior.

                Objective This study aimed to establish the factor structure and reliability of the evaluation instrument measuring monkeypox (Mpox) knowledge, perception and beliefs of health threat in students of the health area in two universities of Peru during 2022. Methods The methodology used was psychometric in nature. The study variable on knowledge of monkeypox was based on the instrument made by Ricco et al., carried out with health professionals, adjusted to Peru and administered to 416 students. Results The results showed adequate goodness-of-fit indicators with RMSEA and SRMR coefficients lower than 0.08 and a TLI lower than 0.90 and adequate reliability values for knowledge of monkeypox (KR20=0.70 and α=0.73), with the perception of health threats being the one with the highest reliability (α=0.88 and Ω=0.89). Conclusions Having instruments that accurately reflect the knowledge, perception and beliefs of health students will make it possible to contribute significantly to the prevention, control and management of this disease and, at the same time, be prepared to address other challenges of public health in the future.

                Sebaceous carcinoma is an extremely rare malignant disease and it is more aggressive when it occurs in the eyelids and orbit. It can mimic several benign lesions, resulting in diagnostic delay. We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma in a 50-year-old male who presented with complaints of swelling of the upper eyelid, which was followed by appearance of an ulcerative growth over the eyelid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports showed an ulcerated mass in the left periorbital and orbital region appearing heterogeneously hyperintense. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed malignant epithelial differentiation which was followed by exenteration of the eyeball. Histopathology showed the rare diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The disease has a poor prognosis as the entity is associated with increased morbidity and if not detected early it can metastasize to other organs which may be fatal sometimes.

                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-626/v1?src=rss">Effect of mindfulness training in adjunct to conventional physiotherapy on pain, function, and mindfulness attention awareness score in recreational long distance runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome: A randomized controlled trial protocol [version 1</a></h4>

              
                Background The Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) poses a significant challenge in sports medicine due to its multifactorial etiology involving both physiological and psychological factors. Though widely used, conventional physiotherapy approaches often yield limited efficacy and high recurrence rates. Mindfulness-based interventions have emerged as promising adjuncts in managing various musculoskeletal conditions, offering potential benefits in pain management, coping strategies, and overall well-being. However, their efficacy in addressing PFPS remains underexplored, particularly in the context of recreational long-distance runners. This study investigates the effects of integrating mindfulness training as an adjunct to conventional physiotherapy on pain intensity, functional outcomes, and mindfulness awareness in recreational long-distance runners with PFPS. Methods Eligible individuals will be assigned randomly to either Group A (Mindfulness Training + Conventional Physiotherapy) or Group B (Conventional Physiotherapy). Outcome measures, such as the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and knee joint position sense using a goniometer will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Mindfulness training will encompass a variety of techniques integrated with conventional physiotherapy sessions. Result This study has the potential to offer an enhanced treatment strategy that considers both the physical and psychological aspects of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS), potentially improving outcomes and well-being for recreational long-distance runners.

                Background As there is high expense of treatment and potential long-term consequences including chronic ankle instability (CAI), lateral ankle sprains (LAS) are common among athletes and represent a substantial healthcare burden. In terms of preventing more injuries and encouraging a full recovery, traditional treatments frequently fall short. Methods At the Department of Sports Physiotherapy, futsal athletes with grade I and grade II lateral ankle sprains will participate in a parallel-group, 1:1 allocation ratio trial. Individuals who fulfil the eligibility requirements will be randomized at random to either the experimental or control group. Conventional physiotherapy treatments will be administered to the control group, and IVR sessions utilizing certain games will be administered to the experimental group in addition to the same therapies. The Y Balance Tool is used to measure dynamic balance, the X Sens MVN system is used to measure vertical jump, and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is used to assess static balance. Result This study aims to offer a new way to improving results for futsal players recovering from lateral ankle sprains by utilizing IVR technology in conjunction with traditional physiotherapy. The results could lead to the creation of more efficient sports-related injury rehabilitation programs, which would improve athlete performance and lessen the incidence of ankle sprains in athletic populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-624/v1?src=rss">The association between non-communicable diseases and COVID-19 severity and mortality among infected hospitalized healthcare workers in 29 countries: a cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to occupational exposure, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) infection than the general population. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may increase the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs, potentially reducing the available health workforce. We examined the association between NCDs and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among infected HCWs. Methods This cohort study used data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) database. HCWs hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2023 due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Variables collected included demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization outcomes. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean/standard deviation (SD), median/interquartile range (IQR), or frequencies and proportions. For each NCD, the relative risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, was calculated using log-binomial regression as well as the population-attributable fraction. Results There were 17,502 HCWs, 95.7% of whom had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority were female (66.5%) and the mean age (SD) was 49.8 (14.3) years. Roughly, half (51.42%) of HCWs had no comorbidities, 29.28% had one comorbidity, 14.68% had 2 comorbidities and <5% had ≥3 comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (49.40%) and cardiovascular disease (36.90%). Approximately one-fifth of the HCWs had severe COVID-19 (16.95%) and 10.68% of the HCWs with COVID-19 died. Being ≥45 years old, male gender, smoking, obesity, and certain NCDs increased the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Obesity and diabetes mellitus were the leading risk factors in terms of the population-attributable risk for COVID-19 severity (6.89%) and mortality (36.00%) respectively. Conclusions Many HCWs with COVID-19 had one or more NCDs. Obesity and diabetes mellitus increased COVID-19 severity and mortality risk. Reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus would yield the biggest reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs.

                <p>by Yu Zhu, Babak Momeni</p>

Host-associated resident microbiota can protect their host from pathogens—a community-level trait called colonization resistance. The effect of the diversity of the resident community in previous studies has shown contradictory results, with higher diversity either strengthening or weakening colonization resistance. To control the confounding factors that may lead to such contradictions, we use mathematical simulations with a focus on species interactions and their impact on colonization resistance. We use a mediator-explicit model that accounts for metabolite-mediated interactions to perform <i>in silico</i> invasion experiments. We show that the relationship between colonization resistance and species richness of the resident community is not monotonic because it depends on two underlying trends as the richness of the resident community increases: a decrease in instances of augmentation (invader species added, without driving out resident species) and an increase in instances of displacement (invader species added, driving out some of the resident species). These trends hold consistently under different parameters, regardless of the number of compounds that mediate interactions between species or the proportion of the facilitative versus inhibitory interactions among species. Our results show a positive correlation between resistance and diversity in low-richness communities and a negative correlation in high-richness communities, offering an explanation for the seemingly contradictory trend in the resistance-diversity relationship in previous reports.

Restrictions of cross-border mobility are typically used to prevent an emerging disease from entering a country in order to slow down its spread. However, such interventions can come with a significant societal cost and should thus be based on careful analysis and quantitative understanding on their effects. To this end, we model the influence of cross-border mobility on the spread of COVID-19 during 2020 in the neighbouring Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We investigate the immediate impact of cross-border travel on disease spread and employ counterfactual scenarios to explore the cumulative effects of introducing additional infected individuals into a population during the ongoing epidemic. Our results indicate that the effect of inter-country mobility on epidemic growth is non-negligible essentially when there is sizeable mobility from a high prevalence country or countries to a low prevalence one. Our findings underscore the critical importance of accurate data and models on both epidemic progression and travel patterns in informing decisions related to inter-country mobility restrictions.

A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory, the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear. We propose a novel, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity.

CRISPR-Cas12a, often regarded as a precise genome editor, still requires improvements in specificity. In this study, we used a GFP-activation assay to screen 14 new Cas12a nucleases for mammalian genome editing, successfully identifying 9 active ones. Notably, these Cas12a nucleases prefer pyrimidine-rich PAMs. Among these nucleases, we extensively characterized Mb4Cas12a obtained from <i>Moraxella bovis CCUG 2133</i>, which recognizes a YYN PAM (Y = C or T). Our biochemical analysis demonstrates that Mb4Cas12a can cleave double-strand DNA across a wide temperature range. To improve specificity, we constructed a SWISS-MODEL of Mb4Cas12a based on the FnCas12a crystal structure and identified 8 amino acids potentially forming hydrogen bonds at the target DNA-crRNA interface. By replacing these amino acids with alanine to disrupt the hydrogen bond, we tested the influence of each mutation on Mb4Cas12a specificity. Interestingly, the F370A mutation improved specificity with minimal influence on activity. Further study showed that Mb4Cas12a-F370A is capable of discriminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These new Cas12a orthologs and high-fidelity variants hold substantial promise for therapeutic applications.

                <p>by Yassine Cherrak, Miguel Angel Salazar, Koray Yilmaz, Markus Kreuzer, Wolf-Dietrich Hardt</p>

The gastrointestinal tract is densely colonized by a polymicrobial community known as the microbiota which serves as primary line of defence against pathogen invasion. The microbiota can limit gut-luminal pathogen growth at different stages of infection. This can be traced to specific commensal strains exhibiting direct or indirect protective functions. Although these mechanisms hold the potential to develop new approaches to combat enteric pathogens, they remain far from being completely described. In this study, we investigated how a mouse commensal <i>Escherichia coli</i> can outcompete <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>. Tm). Using a salmonellosis mouse model, we found that the commensal <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 strain relies on a trojan horse trap strategy to limit <i>S</i>. Tm expansion in the inflamed gut. Combining mutants and reporter tools, we demonstrated that inflammation triggers the expression of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 antimicrobial microcin H47 toxin which, when fused to salmochelin siderophores, can specifically alter <i>S</i>. Tm growth. This protective function was compromised upon disruption of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 <i>tonB</i>-dependent catecholate siderophore uptake system, highlighting a previously unappreciated crosstalk between iron intake and microcin H47 activity. By identifying the genetic determinants mediating <i>S</i>. Tm competition, our work not only provides a better mechanistic understanding of the protective function displayed by members of the gut microbiota but also further expands the general contribution of microcins in bacterial antagonistic relationships. Ultimately, such insights can open new avenues for developing microbiota-based approaches to better control intestinal infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92350">The delayed kinetics of Myddosome formation explains why amyloid-beta aggregates trigger Toll-like receptor 4 less efficiently than lipopolysaccharide</a></h4>

              
                The Myddosome is a key innate immune signalling platform. It forms at the cell surface and contains MyD88 and IRAK proteins which ultimately coordinate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals via the Myddosome when triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates but the magnitude and time duration of the response are very different for reasons that are unclear. Here, we followed the formation of Myddosomes in live macrophages using local delivery of TLR4 agonist to the cell surface and visualisation with 3D rapid light sheet imaging. This was complemented by super-resolution imaging of Myddosomes in fixed macrophages to determine the size of the signalling complex at different times after triggering. Myddosomes formed more rapidly after LPS than in response to sonicated Aβ 1–42 fibrils (80 vs 372 s). The mean lifetimes of the Myddosomes were also shorter when triggered by LPS compared to sonicated Aβ fibrils (170 and 220 s), respectively. In both cases, a range of Myddosome of different sizes (50–500 nm) were formed. In particular, small round Myddosomes around 100 nm in size formed at early time points, then reduced in proportion over time. Collectively, our data suggest that compared to LPS the multivalency of Aβ fibrils leads to the formation of larger Myddosomes which form more slowly and, due to their size, take longer to disassemble. This explains why sonicated Aβ fibrils results in less efficient triggering of TLR4 signalling and may be a general property of protein aggregates.

                Filamentous cyanobacteria are one of the oldest and today still most abundant lifeforms on earth, with manifold implications in ecology and economics. Their flexible filaments, often several hundred cells long, exhibit gliding motility in contact with solid surfaces. The underlying force generating mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that propulsion forces and friction coefficients are strongly coupled in the gliding motility of filamentous cyanobacteria. We directly measure their bending moduli using micropipette force sensors, and quantify propulsion and friction forces by analyzing their self-buckling behavior, complemented with analytical theory and simulations. The results indicate that slime extrusion unlikely generates the gliding forces, but support adhesion-based hypotheses, similar to the better-studied single-celled myxobacteria. The critical self-buckling lengths align well with the peaks of natural length distributions, indicating the importance of self-buckling for the organization of their collective in natural and artificial settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91808">Phosphate as an adjunct to calcium in promoting coronary vascular calcification in chronic inflammatory states</a></h4>

              
                Bone releases calcium and phosphate in response to pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated inflammation. The body develops impaired urinary excretion of phosphate with age and chronic inflammation given the reduction of the kidney protein Klotho, which is essential to phosphate excretion. Phosphate may also play a role in the development of the resistance of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to circulating calcium thus contributing to calcium retention in the circulation. Phosphate can contribute to vascular smooth muscle dedifferentiation with manifestation of osteoblastogenesis and ultimately endovascular calcium phosphate precipitation. Thus phosphate, along with calcium, contributes to the calcification and inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques and the origin of these elements is likely the bone, which serves as storage for the majority of the body’s supply of extracellular calcium and phosphate. Early cardiac evaluation of patients with chronic inflammation and attempts at up-regulating the parathyroid CaSR with calcimimetics or introducing earlier anti-resorptive treatment with bone active pharmacologic agents may serve to delay onset or reduce the quantity of atherosclerotic plaque calcification in these patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95708">Role of N343 glycosylation on the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD structure and co-receptor binding across variants of concern</a></h4>

              
                Glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein represents a key target for viral evolution because it affects both viral evasion and fitness. Successful variations in the glycan shield are difficult to achieve though, as protein glycosylation is also critical to folding and structural stability. Within this framework, the identification of glycosylation sites that are structurally dispensable can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms of the shield and inform immune surveillance. In this work, we show through over 45 μs of cumulative sampling from conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, how the structure of the immunodominant S receptor binding domain (RBD) is regulated by <i>N</i>-glycosylation at N343 and how this glycan’s structural role changes from WHu-1, alpha (B.1.1.7), and beta (B.1.351), to the delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (BA.1 and BA.2.86) variants. More specifically, we find that the amphipathic nature of the <i>N</i>-glycan is instrumental to preserve the structural integrity of the RBD hydrophobic core and that loss of glycosylation at N343 triggers a specific and consistent conformational change. We show how this change allosterically regulates the conformation of the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the WHu-1, alpha, and beta RBDs, but not in the delta and omicron variants, due to mutations that reinforce the RBD architecture. In support of these findings, we show that the binding of the RBD to monosialylated ganglioside co-receptors is highly dependent on N343 glycosylation in the WHu-1, but not in the delta RBD, and that affinity changes significantly across VoCs. Ultimately, the molecular and functional insight we provide in this work reinforces our understanding of the role of glycosylation in protein structure and function and it also allows us to identify the structural constraints within which the glycosylation site at N343 can become a hotspot for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycan shield.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88375">RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL alternatively determines the fate of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94180">SCC3 is an axial element essential for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein that plays a pivotal role in holding sister chromatids together during cell division. Sister chromatid cohesion 3 (SCC3), constituents of cohesin complex, is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Since the deletion of individual cohesin subunit always causes lethality, it is difficult to dissect its biological function in both mitosis and meiosis. Here, we obtained <i>scc3</i> weak mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 system to explore its function during rice mitosis and meiosis. The <i>scc3</i> weak mutants displayed obvious vegetative defects and complete sterility, underscoring the essential roles of SCC3 in both mitosis and meiosis. SCC3 is localized on chromatin from interphase to prometaphase in mitosis. However, in meiosis, SCC3 acts as an axial element during early prophase I and subsequently situates onto centromeric regions following the disassembly of the synaptonemal complex. The loading of SCC3 onto meiotic chromosomes depends on REC8. <i>scc3</i> shows severe defects in homologous pairing and synapsis. Consequently, SCC3 functions as an axial element that is essential for maintaining homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis.

                The neural noise hypothesis of dyslexia posits an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) brain activity as an underlying mechanism of reading difficulties. This study provides the first direct test of this hypothesis using both indirect EEG power spectrum measures in 120 Polish adolescents and young adults (60 with dyslexia, 60 controls) and direct glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7T MRI scanner in half of the sample. Our results, supported by Bayesian statistics, show no evidence of E/I balance differences between groups, challenging the hypothesis that cortical hyperexcitability underlies dyslexia. These findings suggest alternative mechanisms must be explored and highlight the need for further research into the E/I balance and its role in neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Direct modulation of CRH nerve terminal function by noradrenaline and corticosterone.</a></h4>

              
                Nerve terminals are the final point of regulation before neurosecretion. As such, neuromodulators acting on nerve terminals can exert significant influence on neural signalling. Hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons send axonal projections to the median eminence where CRH is secreted to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Noradrenaline and corticosterone are two of the most important neuromodulators of HPA axis function; noradrenaline excites CRH neurons and corticosterone inhibits CRH neurons by negative feedback. Here, we used GCaMP6f Ca2+ imaging and measurement of nerve terminal CRH secretion using sniffer cells to determine whether these neuromodulators act directly on CRH nerve terminals. Contrary to expectations, noradrenaline inhibited action potential-dependent Ca2+ elevations in CRH nerve terminals and suppressed evoked CRH secretion. This inhibitory effect was blocked by 2-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Corticosterone also suppressed evoked CRH peptide secretion from nerve terminals, independent of action potential-dependent Ca2+ levels. This inhibition was prevented by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU486, and indicates that CRH nerve terminals may be a site of fast glucocorticoid negative feedback. Together these findings establish median eminence nerve terminals as a key site for regulation of the HPA axis.

">Interactively Integrating Reach and Grasp Information in Macaque Premotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Successful reach-to-grasp movements necessitate the integration of both object location and grip type information. However, how these two types of information are encoded in a single brain region and to what extend they interact with each other, remain largely unknown. We designed a novel experimental paradigm that sequentially prompted reach and grasp cues to monkeys and recorded neural activity in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) to investigate how the encoding structures change and interact during arm reaching and hand grasping movements. This paradigm required monkeys to retain the first prompted cue when the second one arrived, and integrate both to accomplish a final goal movement. PMd neurons represented both reach and grasp to similar extend, yet the encodings were not independent. Upon the arrival of second cue, PMd continued to encode the first cue, albeit with a significantly altered structure, as evidenced by more than half of the neurons displaying incongruent modulation. At a population level, the encoding structure formed a distinct subspace that differed from, but was not entirely orthogonal to, the original one. Employing canonical correlation analysis, we identified a subspace that consistently preserved the encoding of the initial cue, potentially serving as a mechanism for downstream brain regions to extract coherent information. Furthermore, this shared subspace comprised a diverse population of neurons, including both congruent and incongruent units. these findings support the argument that reach and grasp information are interactively integrated within PMd, with a shared subspace likely underpinning a consistent encoding framework.

">Brain Age Prediction: Deep Models Need a Hand to Generalize</a></h4>

              
                In the pursuit of studying brain aging, numerous models to predict brain age from T1-weighted MRI have been developed. Recently, many of these models take advantage of deep learning architectures, and although they have shown some success in terms of reported Mean Absolute Error in predicted age, doubts linger regarding their generalization ability due to the large number of trainable parameters in deep models and the limited training data available in medical imaging datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation details of the proposed models' generalization ability are often overlooked in the literature. In this study, we assess a deep model, SFCN-reg, based on the VGG-16 architecture, and examine whether we can enhance its generalizability and robustness by (1) employing a more than minimal preprocessing pipeline, (2) incorporating more extensive data augmentation during training, and (3) applying regularization to the model. We found that the age prediction mean absolute error in independent out-of-distribution publicly available cohorts is reduced from 5.25 years to 2.96 years (44% improvement) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and from 4.35 years to 3.40 years (22% improvement) in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset, closing the generalization gap to less than 0.9 years when better preprocessing is used. Moreover, data augmentation and model regularization reduce the scan-rescan error from 0.86 years to 0.61 years (29% improvement), increasing the model robustness. The final model is also much less sensitive against registration errors, showing almost no bias in comparison with other models when facing incorrectly registered images.

">Synaptic alterations in pyramidal cells following genetic manipulation of neuronal excitability in monkey prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                In schizophrenia, layer 3 pyramidal neurons (L3PNs) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are thought to receive fewer excitatory synaptic inputs and to have lower expression levels of activity-dependent genes and of genes involved in mitochondrial energy production. In concert, these findings from previous studies suggest that DLPFC L3PNs are hypoactive in schizophrenia, disrupting the patterns of activity that are crucial for working memory, which is impaired in the illness. However, whether lower PN activity produces alterations in inhibitory and/or excitatory synaptic strength has not been tested in the primate DLPFC. Here, we decreased PN excitability in rhesus monkey DLPFC in vivo using adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to produce Cre recombinase-mediated overexpression of Kir2.1 channels, a genetic silencing tool that efficiently decreases neuronal excitability. In acute slices prepared from DLPFC 7-12 weeks post-AAV microinjections, Kir2.1-overexpressing PNs had a significantly reduced excitability largely attributable to highly specific effects of the AAV-encoded Kir2.1 channels. Moreover, recordings of synaptic currents showed that Kir2.1-overexpressing DLPFC PNs had reduced strength of excitatory synapses whereas inhibitory synaptic inputs were not affected. The decrease in excitatory synaptic strength was not associated with changes in dendritic spine number, suggesting that excitatory synapse quantity was unaltered in Kir2.1-overexpressing DLPFC PNs. These findings suggest that, in schizophrenia, the excitatory synapses on hypoactive L3PNs are weaker and thus might represent a substrate for novel therapeutic interventions.

">Salience signaling and stimulus scaling of ventral tegmental area glutamate neuron subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamatergic neurons participate in reward, aversion, drug-seeking, and stress. Subsets of VTA VGluT2+ neurons are capable of co-transmitting glutamate and GABA (VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons), transmitting glutamate without GABA (VGluT2+VGaT- neurons), or co-transmitting glutamate and dopamine (VGluT2+TH+ neurons), but whether these molecularly distinct subpopulations show behavior-related differences is not wholly understood. We identified that neuronal activity of each VGluT2+ subpopulation is sensitive to reward value but signaled this in different ways. The phasic maximum activity of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons increased with sucrose concentration, whereas VGluT2+VGaT- neurons increased maximum and sustained activity with sucrose concentration, and VGluT2+TH+ neurons increased sustained but not maximum activity with sucrose concentration. Additionally, VGluT2+ subpopulations signaled consummatory preferences in different ways. VGluT2+VGaT- neurons and VGluT2+TH+ neurons showed a signaling preference for a behaviorally-preferred fat reward over sucrose, but in temporally-distinct ways. In contrast, VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely signaled a less behaviorally-preferred sucrose reward compared with fat. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2+VGaT+ consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by hunger state, and not dependent on caloric content or behavioral preference. All VGluT2+ subtypes increased neuronal activity following aversive stimuli but VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons during low intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion. We interpret these data such that VTA glutamatergic subpopulations signal different elements of rewarding and aversive experiences and highlight the unique role of VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons in enhancing the salience of behavioral experiences.

">Patch and matrix striatonigral neurons differentially regulate locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Striatonigral neurons, known to promote locomotion, reside in both the patch and matrix compartments of the dorsal striatum. However, their compartment-specific contributions to locomotion remain largely unexplored. Using molecular identifier Kremen1 and Calb1, we showed in mouse models that patch and matrix striatonigral neurons exert opposite influences on locomotion. Matrix striatonigral neurons reduced their activity before the cessation of self-paced locomotion, while patch striatonigral neuronal activity increased, suggesting an inhibitory function. Indeed, optogenetic activation of patch striatonigral neurons suppressed ongoing locomotion with reduced striatal dopamine release, contrasting with the locomotion-promoting effect of matrix striatonigral neurons, which showed an initial increase in dopamine release. Furthermore, genetic deletion of the GABA-B receptor in Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1-positive (ALDH1A1+) nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons completely abolished the locomotion-suppressing effect of patch striatonigral neurons. Our findings unravel a compartment-specific mechanism governing locomotion in the dorsal striatum, where patch striatonigral neurons suppress locomotion by inhibiting ALDH1A1+ nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.

">Minimizing command timing volatility is a key factor in skilled actions</a></h4>

              
                Variability between movements prevents the best athletes from making a perfect shot every time. While fluctuations in the amplitude of neural sensory inputs and motor outputs are thought to be primarily responsible, they only account for a fraction of the observed variability. Here, we propose that a significant portion of the variability is due to imprecisely timed motor commands. This command timing volatility theory best explained the three peaks observed in the force variability's time-series in discrete reaching movements and during periodic force control. Furthermore, we show how the timing volatility in the non-dominant arm's muscles is larger than in the dominant arm, then develop a variability index that estimates the arm's timing volatility via its variability during circle tracing. The difference in the variability index between the left and right hands accurately predicts the Edinburgh Quotient, suggesting a relationship between handedness and the command timing volatility of the left- and right-hands. Lastly, we constructed a simulation of reaching movements made by an arm controlled by muscles whose command timing was made incrementally more volatile. As timing volatility increased, aiming became less precise and movements jerkier. Such impairments during reaching are reported in patients with different neuronal diseases that damage any brain regions critical to motor timing, suggesting that essential aspects of these symptoms may be caused by excessive timing volatility. Our theory provides a unifying computational perspective of movement variability in healthy and diseased individuals that is essential to understanding the control of movements.

">Chromogranin A Deficiency Attenuates Tauopathy by Altering Epinephrine Alpha-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Our previous studies have indicated that insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hypertension in aged wild-type (WT) mice can be reversed in mice lacking chromogranin A (CgA-KO mice). These health conditions are associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CgA, a neuroendocrine secretory protein has been detected in protein aggregates in the brains of AD patients. Here, we determined the role of CgA in tauopathies, including AD (secondary tauopathy) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD, primary tauopathy). We found elevated levels of CgA in both AD and CBD brains, which were positively correlated with increased phosphorylated tau in the frontal cortex. Furthermore, CgA ablation in a human P301S tau (hTau) transgenic mice (CgA-KO/hTau) exhibited reduced tau aggregation, resistance to tau spreading, and an extended lifespan, coupled with improved cognitive function. Transcriptomic analysis of mice cortices highlighted altered levels of alpha-adrenergic receptors (Adra) in hTau mice compared to WT mice, akin to AD patients. Since CgA regulates the release of the Adra ligands epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE), we determined their levels and found elevated EPI levels in the cortices of hTau mice, AD and CBD patients. CgA-KO/hTau mice exhibited reversal of EPI levels in the cortex and the expression of several affected genes, including Adra1 and 2, nearly returning them to WT levels. Treatment of hippocampal slice cultures with EPI or an Adra1 agonist intensified, while an Adra1 antagonist inhibited, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. These findings reveal a critical role of CgA in regulation of tau pathogenesis via the EPI-Adra signaling axis.

">A General Framework for Characterizing Optimal Communication in Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Communication in brain networks is the foundation of cognitive function and behavior. A multitude of evolutionary pressures, including the minimization of metabolic costs while maximizing communication efficiency, contribute to shaping the structure and dynamics of these networks. However, how communication efficiency is characterized depends on the assumed model of communication dynamics. Traditional models include shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Yet, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication remains to be established. Our study addresses this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through game theory, based on a combination of structural data from human cortical networks with computational models of brain dynamics. We quantified the exact influence exerted by each brain node over every other node using an exhaustive multi-site virtual lesioning scheme, creating optimal influence maps for various models of brain dynamics. These descriptions show how communication patterns unfold in the given brain network if regions maximize their influence over one another. By comparing these influence maps with a large variety of brain communication models, we found that optimal communication most closely resembles a broadcasting model in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we show that the most influential regions within the cortex are formed by its rich-club. These regions exploit their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways, thereby significantly enhancing their effective reach even when the anatomical connections are weak. Our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal communication across brain networks and reveals the most influential brain regions and the topological features underlying their optimal communication.

">The first interneuron of the mouse visual system is tailored to the natural environment through morphology and electrical coupling</a></h4>

              
                The topographic complexity of the mouse retina has long been underestimated, as obvious specializations, like a fovea or visual streak, are absent. However, anatomical and functional gradients exist. It was recently shown that receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change their shape along the dorso-ventral retinal axis. These variations likely reflect the non-uniform statistics of the visual environment which vary dramatically from ground to sky. Horizontal cells are the first visual interneurons and dictate the synaptic signaling between photoreceptors and bipolar cells by lateral interactions, thereby shaping the receptive fields of down-stream neurons. Thus, we asked whether regional specializations are present at this earliest stage of synaptic circuitry, i.e. at the level of horizontal cells. We analyzed horizontal cell density distributions, morphological properties, localization of gap junction proteins, and the spatial extent of horizontal cell electrical coupling across complete retinas. All of these horizontal cell key features were asymmetrically organized along the dorso-ventral axis. Dorsal horizontal cells were less densely distributed, had larger dendritic trees, and electrical coupling was more extensive than in their ventral counterparts. The steepest change along this gradient occurred at the opsin transition zone of photoreceptors, i.e. the mouse visual horizon. Therefore, our results show that the cellular and synaptic organization of the mouse visual system are adapted to the visual environment at the earliest possible level, and that horizontal cells are well suited to form the cellular substrate for the global gradient previously described for the receptive field structures of retinal ganglion cells.

">Identifying factors that contribute to collision avoidance behaviours while walking in a natural environment</a></h4>

              
                Busy walking paths, like in a park, a sidewalk in a city centre, or a shopping mall, frequently necessitate collision avoidance behaviour. Lab-based research has shown how a variety of situation-specific factors (e.g., distraction, object/pedestrian proximity) and person-specific factors (e.g., pedestrian size, age), typically studied independently, affect avoidance behaviour. What happens in the real world is unclear. Thus, we filmed unscripted pedestrian walking behaviours on a busy ~3.5 m urban path adjacent to the water. We leveraged deep learning algorithms to identify and extract walking trajectories of pedestrians and had unbiased raters characterize interaction details. Here we analyzed over 500 situations where two pedestrians approached each other from opposite ends (i.e., one-on-one pedestrian interactions). We found that smaller medial-lateral distance between approaching pedestrians and a lower number of surrounding pedestrians (i.e., smaller crowd size) predicted an increase in the likelihood of a subsequent path deviation. Furthermore, we found that whether a pedestrian looked distracted or held, pushed, or pulled something while walking predicted the medial-lateral distance between pedestrians at the time of crossing. Although pedestrians maintained a larger personal space boundary compared to lab settings, this is likely because of the outdoor path's width. Overall, our results suggest that collision avoidance behaviours in lab and real-world environments share similarities and offer insights relevant to developing more accurate computational models for realistic pedestrian movement.

                INTRODUCTION: The effects of sex, race, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) - Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors - on white matter integrity are not well characterized. METHODS: Diffusion MRI data from nine well-established longitudinal cohorts of aging were free-water (FW)-corrected and harmonized. This dataset included 4,702 participants (age=73.06 {+/-} 9.75) with 9,671 imaging sessions over time. FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAFWcorr) were used to assess differences in white matter microstructure by sex, race, and APOE-{epsilon}4 carrier status. RESULTS: Sex differences in FAFWcorr in association and projection tracts, racial differences in FAFWcorr in projection tracts, and APOE-{epsilon}4 differences in FW limbic and occipital transcallosal tracts were most pronounced. DISCUSSION: There are prominent differences in white matter microstructure by sex, race, and APOE-{epsilon}4 carrier status. This work adds to our understanding of disparities in AD. Additional work to understand the etiology of these differences is warranted.

">Differences in fMRI-based functional connectivity during abstinence or interventions between heroin-dependent individuals and healthy controls</a></h4>

              
                The substantial personal, societal, and economic impacts of opioid addiction drive research investigating how opioid addiction affects the brain, and whether therapies attenuate addiction-related metrics of brain function. One useful approach to characterise the effects of opioid addiction on the brain is functional connectivity (FC). FC assesses the pairwise relationship of brain region function over time. This work is a systematic narrative review of studies investigating the effect of abstinence or interventions on FC in people who are dependent on heroin (HD) and healthy controls (HC). We found that HD typically showed weaker FC between three functional networks: the Executive Control Network, Default Mode Network, and the Salience Network. Abstinence and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) both attenuated differences in FC between HD and HC, often by increasing FC in HD. We critically assessed the clinical relevance of these results and the impact of study methods on the robustness of study results. We concluded with practical suggestions to improve the translational potential of neuromodulatory interventions (e.g., noninvasive brain stimulation) targeting the neural correlates of opioid addiction.

	<p>This paper proposes a new hybrid model for classifying stress states using EEG signals, combining multi-domain transfer entropy (TrEn) with a two-dimensional PCANet (2D-PCANet) approach. The aim is to create an automated system for identifying stress levels, which is crucial for early intervention and mental health management. A major challenge in this field lies in extracting meaningful emotional information from the complex patterns observed in EEG. Our model addresses this by initially applying independent component analysis (ICA) to purify the EEG signals, enhancing the clarity for further analysis. We then leverage the adaptability of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) to represent the EEG data in time, frequency, and time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency domains. This multi-domain representation allows for a more nuanced understanding of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity in response to stress. The subsequent stage involves the deployment of a two-layer 2D-PCANet network designed to autonomously distill EEG features associated with stress. These features are then classified by a support vector machine (SVM) to determine the stress state. Moreover, stress induction and data acquisition experiments are designed. We employed two distinct tasks known to trigger stress responses. Other stress-inducing elements that enhance the stress response were included in the experimental design, such as time limits and performance feedback. The EEG data collected from 15 participants were retained. The proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of over 92% on this self-collected dataset, enabling stress state detection under different task-induced conditions.</p>

	<p>Panic disorder (PD) and focal epilepsy, in particular, temporal lobe epilepsy, often present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical manifestations. This article describes the case of a 25-year-old female, misdiagnosed with PD for 15 years, whose recurring episodes of sudden fear, palpitations, and nausea were later identified as manifestations of focal epilepsy. Initially unresponsive to conventional anti-anxiety medications, the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s correct diagnosis was only established through comprehensive electro-clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evaluations during her admission to our research hospital. Long-term video&amp;amp;ndash;EEG monitoring (LTVEM) played a pivotal role in identifying the epileptic nature of her episodes, which were characterized by paroxysmal activity in the right temporal and zygomatic regions, consistent with the location of a dysplastic lesion in the right amygdala, as revealed by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. These findings underline the importance of considering focal epilepsy in the differential diagnosis of PD, especially in cases refractory to standard psychiatric treatments. The misdiagnosis of epilepsy as PD can lead to significant delays in appropriate treatment, potentially exacerbating the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition and affecting their quality of life. This case emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach and the utilization of advanced diagnostic tools like LTVEM in elucidating the underlying causes of paroxysmal psychiatric symptoms.</p>

                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (EPWB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on EPWB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and EPWB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

                Background The pedicle screw rod system is believed to correction of 3-dimensional deformity and maintain the results of the correction, so the better sagittal balance correction can be expected. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 43 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who performed correction, stabilization and posterior fusion to determine the effect of spinal and spinopelvic components on sagittal balance correction. X-ray data were measured for thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis as the spinal components and pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS) as the spinopelvic components. Further evaluations include sagittal spinal balance (C7PL), global sagittal balance, and sacrofemoral distance pre- and post-surgery. Statistical evaluation is performed to determine the correlation between the spinal and the spinopelvic components and the achievement of sagittal balance correction. Results TK/Sagittal Modifier obtained a significant correction with an average is 18.69° (±9.57), while LL (lumbar lordosis) has 44.58 ° (±11.94). Average of C7PL correction is 0.68 cm (±3.13), Global Sagittal Balance is -2.04 cm (±3.24), and SCFD is 2.69 cm (±2.48). The TK/LL degree doesn’t significantly influence on Global Sagittal Balance and C7PL. The TK degree significantly affects SCFD, whereas LL doesn’t significantly affect SCFD. Changes in each spinopelvic component are not significant in affecting Global Sagittal Balance. Conclusions Correction and stabilization of AIS’s patients using the pedicle screw rod system resulted in significant Spinal Component TK/Sagittal Modifier and LL correction. Meanwhile, Spinopelvic Components didn’t achieve significant correction. Mean correction of C7PL is -2.66 (±4.4) and Global Sagittal is -3.11 cm (±4.94), SCFD only managed to correct 37.3%. Global Sagittal Balance is not significantly affected by all components of Spinopelvic components, while the C7PL is only affected by PT. Only PT and SS that significantly affected SCFD.

                <p>Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of motor and/or vocal tics. Common neurophysiological frameworks suggest dysregulations of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) brain circuit that controls movement execution. Besides common tics, there are other "non-tic" symptoms that are primarily related to sensory perception, sensorimotor integration, attention, and social cognition. The existence of these symptoms, the sensory tic triggers, and the modifying effect of attention and cognitive control mechanisms on tics may indicate the salience network's (SN) involvement in the neurophysiology of TD. Resting-state functional MRI measurements were performed in 26 participants with TD and 25 healthy controls (HC). The group differences in resting-state functional connectivity patterns were measured based on seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses. Compared to HC, patients with TD exhibited altered connectivity between the core regions of the SN (insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal junction) and sensory, associative, and motor-related cortices. Furthermore, connectivity changes were observed in relation to the severity of tics in the TD group. The SN, particularly the insula, is likely to be an important site of dysregulation in TD. Our results provide evidence for large-scale neural deviations in TD beyond the CSTC pathologies. These findings may be relevant for developing treatment targets.</p>

                Background Previous Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of obesity susceptibility genes in different populations have confirmed the association of some variants with obesity, body mass index (BMI), and some related metabolic traits. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to investigate the genetic basis of obesity in the Jordanian population. The aim of our study is to investigate the occurrence and frequency of obesity-related genes in Jordanian individuals and any possible relationship between SNP genetic markers and phenotypic characteristics of studied individuals. Methods A total of 150 Jordanian unrelated adults, including 83 obese, 26 overweight, and 41 normal-weight subjects, were genotyped using the high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) and tested for the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2167270 in LEP gene and rs1137100 in LEPR gene, with obesity risk, obesity/overweight risk, BMI, weight, height, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood level glucose. Results A significant association between obesity risk and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed under a dominant model (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5147, 95% CI =1.0629 to 5.9494, p = 0.0358). A marginal (not significant) association between BMI and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene (p = 0.075), was also detected. Moreover, an association between rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene and glucose blood level was observed (p = 0.038). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol also presented a weak association with the rs1137100 mutation in LEPR gene, with p = 0.071 and p = 0.078, respectively. Additionally, no significant association between LDL-cholesterol and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed (p = 0.091). By contrast, there was no association between weight or height and the SNPs mutation evaluated in this study (p > 0.05). Conclusions These results suggest that some SNPs in some obesity-related genes may contribute to obesity risk and its related anthropometric and metabolic traits in Jordanian population. To confirm these results, further studies on a larger Jordanian cohort should be carried out.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those on hemodialysis, are at increased risk of developing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Guidelines suggest that all patients with CKD should be vaccinated against HBV, but these guidelines are usually not followed. We conducted this study to know the status of vaccination against HBV in CKD patients on regular hemodialysis. Methods This observational descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Teaching Hospital, Poonch Medical College Rawalakot , and POF Teaching Hospital, Wah Medical College Wah Cantt, from March to July 2019. Patients reporting to the dialysis center of both hospitals on regular dialysis were included in the study. Patient information (HBV vaccination status, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, duration of CKD and duration of dialysis) were collected on a specially designed questionnaire. The statistical analysis of data was done in SPSS for Windows, version 20. Results A total 149 patients were included in the study, 63.1% were male and 36.9% were female. Out of these 24.2% were uneducated, 33.6% had 1–10 years school education, 38.2% had 10–14 years education, and 4% had more than 14 years education. About 35% patients were from low socioeconomic class, 54% from middle and 11% from higher class. Only 45.6% (n=68) of patients were vaccinated and 54.4% (n=81) were not vaccinated against HBV. Vaccination status was significantly associated with education (p=0.004) and socioeconomic status (p=0.008). Conclusion The HBV status of patients on regular hemodialysis is not satisfactory at the two centers observed. It is associated with education and socioeconomic status of the patient.

                Background Gender equity in academia is a significant challenge. To investigate career advancement perspectives of mid-career female physician-scientists, identify their needs and barriers, and develop a mentor-sponsorship strategy to improve their representation in higher academic ranks. Methods In this qualitative study, conducted at a Western European academic medical center, we interviewed 19 mid-career female physician-scientists across all specialties, including radiology. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: 1. Horizontal and vertical ambitions, (i.e., knowledge expansion and hierarchical advancement) 2. Evaluation of talent, 3. Career path needs, and 4. Receiving support. These themes revealed barriers to women's advancement, including limited talent recognition, inadequate leadership support, self-limiting beliefs, structural issues, and lack of networking opportunities. To address these challenges, a mentor-sponsorship program should prioritize sponsor training, start immediately at the beginning of the mid-career phase (attainment of assistant professorship), emphasize horizontal and vertical development, take work-life balance into account, establish mentor networks, and allow individuals to choose mentors and sponsors based on their needs and aspirations. Conclusions This study has identified key needs and barriers that impede the advancement of female physician-scientists in academia. To address these challenges, a tailored mentor-sponsorship program is recommended. Key program elements include training leadership to recognize talent and offer proactive support, starting at the onset of the mid-career phase, emphasizing horizontal and vertical development, and establishing a strong mentor-sponsor network with thoughtful matching. These actions can help to overcome obstacles and facilitate the progress of women in academia.

                This study aimed to validate the Worker Well-Being Questionnaire, originally developed by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in the Malay language. The translation process involved an initial independent translation by a professional translator, followed by a comparison of translations to synthesize a unified version, which was subsequently back-translated. The back-translations were then reviewed by an expert committee to create a finalized questionnaire version. The results of this validation study indicate a high level of satisfaction, demonstrating an excellent fit with confirmatory factor analysis (CFI and TLI values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99) and a low root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA values ranging from 0.03 to 0.07). Moreover, the questionnaire exhibits sound internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.7, and the factor structures align with theoretical expectations. In conclusion, the Malay version of the questionnaire faithfully reproduces the original instrument, enabling a robust and efficient assessment of workers’ well.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created the need to evaluate drugs such as favipiravir (FPV), an antiviral inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and Maraviroc (MVC), an antiretroviral that antagonizes the chemokine receptor CCR5, which could affect the modulation of inflammation and viral replication in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the effect of MVC and/or FPV plus systemic steroid (SS) vs. SS alone on the viral load and progression to critical disease. Methods Sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 were evaluated in three treatment arms: 1) SS only (n=6), 2) SS plus one test drug MVC or FPV (n=5), and 3) SS plus both test drugs (MVC and FPV, n=5). The viral load was determined for N, E, and RdRp viral genes. Results A significant decrease in viral load was observed in the three treatment groups, with a larger effect size in the group that combined SS with both test drugs. The E, N, and RdRp genes with Cohen’s d were 120%, 123%, and 50%, respectively. Conclusions The largest effect on viral load reduction, as measured by effect size, was observed in the combination treatment group; however, no statistical significance was found, and it did not prevent progression to critical illness.

                Background There is an essential need for cardiomyocyte regeneration among patients with heart failure. Transplantation of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells may lead to an improvement of cardiomyocyte regeneration among heart failure patients. We believe that DFAT cells are promising candidate cell sources for cardiac regeneration. However, the pathway underlying how DFAT cells of the adipose lineage differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes isn’t fully understood. Methods We conducted an experimental laboratory study on isolated DFAT cells from adipose tissue of healthy adults. Then, we treated cells with different concentrations of reversine (10, 20 and 40 nM), and performed RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Next, we used a ceiling culture method based on the buoyancy properties of mature lipid-filled adipocytes. Stemness expression (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], brachyury, Fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1]) was quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, while cardiomyocyte expression (Transcription factor GATA-4 [GATA4] and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) was quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc found that 10 nM reversine increased greater Flk-1 expression compared to the control group (MD: 5.037 + 0.998; p < 0.001), but there were no significant changes among Oct4 (MD: 0.013 + 1.244; p = 0.99) and brachyury expression (MD: 0.157 + 0.084; p = 0.252). Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the expression of GATA4 (1.65 [0.41-1.98] to 0.015 [0.007-0.034]; p =0.017) reduced significantly from day 7 until day 21 and cTnT (5.07 [6.62-8.91] to 8.22 [6.81-9.40]; p= 0.001) increased significantly from day 7 until day 21. Conclusions Reversine could increase the expression of Flk-1, but it was unable to stimulate the expression of Oct4 and brachyury related to cell stemness. An optimal concentration of 10 nM reversine may have the greatest effect on enhancing the differentiation of DFAT cells into mature cardiomyocytes, as indicated by higher cTnT expression between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-617/v1?src=rss">Zoom fatigue related to online learning among medical students in Thailand:  Prevalence, predictors, and association with depression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning pattern of medical students shifted from onsite to online. This transition may contribute to what has been called “Zoom fatigue.” This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Zoom fatigue related to online learning, identify associated factors of Zoom fatigue, and explore its correlation with depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1st to 6th-year Thai medical students. The online survey was administered using a demographic and health behavior questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Thai version of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF-T). Results Among the 386 participating students, 221 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 20.6 years. The prevalence of high Zoom fatigue was 9.6%. In the multivariable regression analysis, a lower academic year and a higher number of online learning sessions were significant predictors of Zoom fatigue (p < 0.001), while regular exercise emerged as a protective factor (p = 0.009). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 61.9%, and a significant correlation was found between having a depressive disorder and experiencing Zoom fatigue (p = 0.004). Conclusion Zoom fatigue among medical students was correlated with depression. Consequently, medical students experiencing Zoom fatigue should undergo further assessment for depression. It is crucial to closely monitor medical students in lower academic years with a high number of online sessions for signs of Zoom fatigue. Additionally, implementing strategies, such as reducing the frequency of online sessions and promoting regular exercise, may help alleviate the symptoms.

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Abstract* Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Introduction Hemiplegia is the common term used to describe a multitude of clinical problems associated with a stroke. Hemiplegic stroke accounts for 70-85% of all first strokes. Trunk stability is impaired due to hypertonia and weakness in hemiplegia. Impaired trunk control leads to gait and postural abnormalities which if left untreated causes permanent disability in hemiplegics. Objective To investigate the scope of research on the benefits of explicit training using Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT) for enhancing tone and postural control in subjects with hemiplegic stroke. Methods In order to adhere to established protocols of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, the systematic review will be carried out to find pertinent studies published up to the search date, and a thorough search strategy will be applied across popular electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. This systematic review methodology has been registered in PROSPERO for rigorous and transparent dissemination of study search, synthesis, and analysis. Discussion As the motor impairments due to abnormal tone and postural impairment in hemiplegic stroke substantially impact a stroke survivor’s quality of life, this study will provide a thorough and methodical approach to synthesize and report the merits and demerits on the effectiveness of NDT in enhancing tone and postural control, considering the potential variability in interventions and outcomes, and the methodological rigor of particular studies. The review also intends to provide significant insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by critically analysing and summarizing the present state of research in this domain. This will facilitate evidence-based decision-making in rehabilitation techniques for patients with hemiplegic stroke. Systematic Review Registration number CRD42023476137

                <p>by Nikolaos M. Dimitriou, Salvador Flores-Torres, Maria Kyriakidou, Joseph Matthew Kinsella, Georgios D. Mitsis</p>

Cell sedimentation in 3D hydrogel cultures refers to the vertical migration of cells towards the bottom of the space. Understanding this poorly examined phenomenon may allow us to design better protocols to prevent it, as well as provide insights into the mechanobiology of cancer development. We conducted a multiscale experimental and mathematical examination of 3D cancer growth in triple negative breast cancer cells. Migration was examined in the presence and absence of Paclitaxel, in high and low adhesion environments and in the presence of fibroblasts. The observed behaviour was modeled by hypothesizing active migration due to self-generated chemotactic gradients. Our results confirmed this hypothesis, whereby migration was likely to be regulated by the MAPK and TGF-βpathways. The mathematical model enabled us to describe the experimental data in absence (normalized error<40%) and presence of Paclitaxel (normalized error<10%), suggesting inhibition of random motion and advection in the latter case. Inhibition of sedimentation in low adhesion and co-culture experiments further supported the conclusion that cells actively migrated downwards due to the presence of signals produced by cells already attached to the adhesive glass surface.

                Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK, encoded by the SYK gene, is a non-receptor type protein kinase which mediates immune signal transduction through immunoreceptors. Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK expression has been associated with the development of various inflammatory diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions. The reproducibility of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK research would help elucidate the mechanism in which it causes neuroinflammation as well as its potential as a novel target to treat Alzheimer’s disease. This would be facilitated with the availability of high-quality tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. In this study, we characterized thirteen tyrosine-protein kinase SYK commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neuron impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and if and how transplantation of healthy GABAergic neurons can improve AD, remain unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human-derived medial ganglionic eminence progenitors (hiMGEs) differentiated from programmed induced neural precursor cells (hiNPCs) were injected into the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (HIP).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that grafts migrate to the whole brain and form functional synaptic connections in amyloid precursor protein gene/ presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) chimeric mice. Following transplantation of hiMGEs, behavioral deficits and AD-related pathology were alleviated and defective neurons were repaired. Notably, exosomes secreted from hiMGEs, which are rich in anti-inflammatory miRNA, inhibited astrocyte activation <i>in</i>
<i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the mechanism was related to regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that hiMGEs transplantation is an alternative treatment for neuronal loss in AD and demonstrate that exosomes with anti-inflammatory activity derived from hiMGEs are important factors for graft survival. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Cerebral vasculitis is a rare but severe complication of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), presenting significant challenges in management due to its potential for devastating neurological consequences and poor prognosis. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with known SLE who presented with seizures, declining cognitive function, and unresponsiveness. Neurological examination, laboratory investigations, and radiological imaging supported the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis secondary to SLE. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, the patient’s neurological status continued to deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Ultimately, the patient succumbed to multiorgan failure attributed to severe CNS vasculitis and its complications. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of cerebral vasculitis in SLE while highlighting the need for further research into more effective therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the clinical progression of the brain-/body-first categories within Lewy body disease (LBD): Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and PD dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to establish a population-based cohort of clinically diagnosed LBD. We used two definitions for differentiating between brain- and body-first LBD: a previously hypothesized body-first presentation in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior onset before motor symptoms onset; and an expanded definition of body-first LBD when a patient had at least 2 premotor symptoms between constipation, erectile dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior, anosmia, or neurogenic bladder.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with PD (RR = 1.43, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas body-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with DLB (RR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Under the expanded definition, there was no difference in LBD diagnosis between brain-first and body-first patients (PD: RR = 1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.10; DLB: RR = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.58) There were no patterns between brain- or body-first presentation, PD dementia under either definition (original: <i>p</i> = 0.09, expanded: <i>p</i> = 0.97), and no significant difference in motor symptoms between brain-first and body-first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings do not support the dichotomous classification of body-first and brain-first LBD with the currently proposed definition. Biological exposures resulting in PD and DLB are unlikely to converge on a binary classification of top-down or bottom-up synuclein pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Motor learning is central to human existence, such as learning to speak or walk, sports moves, or rehabilitation after injury. Evidence suggests that all forms of motor learning share an evolutionarily conserved molecular plasticity pathway. Here, we present novel insights into the neural processes underlying operant self-learning, a form of motor learning in the fruit fly Drosophila. Methods We operantly trained wild type and transgenic Drosophila fruit flies, tethered at the torque meter, in a motor learning task that required them to initiate and maintain turning maneuvers around their vertical body axis (yaw torque). We combined this behavioral experiment with transgenic peptide expression, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, spatio-temporally controlled gene knock-out and confocal microscopy. Results We find that expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) in direct wing steering motoneurons co-expressing the transcription factor FoxP is necessary for this type of motor learning and that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways. We also found that it takes more than a week for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of FoxP in adult animals to impair motor learning, suggesting that adult FoxP expression is required for operant self-learning. Conclusions Our experiments suggest that, for operant self-learning, a type of motor learning in Drosophila, co-expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and the transcription factor FoxP is necessary in direct wing steering motoneurons. Some of these neurons control the wing beat amplitude when generating optomotor responses, and we have discovered modulation of optomotor behavior after operant self-learning. We also discovered that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways and that FoxP expression is also required in adult flies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a barrier between the circulatory system and the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to CNS protection and maintaining the brain homeostasis. Establishment of in vitro BBB models that are closer to the microenvironment of the human brain is helpful for evaluating the potential and efficiency of a drug penetrating BBB and thus the clinical application value of the drug. The in vitro BBB models not only provide great convenience for screening new drugs that can access to CNS but also help people to have a deeper study on the mechanism of substances entering and leaving the brain, which makes people have greater opportunities in the treatment of CNS diseases. Up to now, although much effort has been paid to the researches on the in vitro BBB models and many progresses have been achieved, no unified method has been described for establishing a BBB model and there is much work to do and many challenges to be faced with in the future. This review summarizes the research progresses in the establishment, evaluation, and application of in vitro BBB models.</p>

<p>The new rTMS therapeutic module (iTBS) can alter microglial polarization and improve motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation with ischemic stroke in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroinflammation caused by excessive microglial activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulatory technique that has recently been reported to regulate microglial functions and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The intermittent burst stimulation (iTBS) regimen in rTMS improves neuronal excitability. However, whether iTBS exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating neurons and thereby modulating microglial polarization remains unclear. Motor function was assessed after 1 week of rTMS (iTBS regimen) treatment in adult male mice with occlusion/reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO/r) injury. We also investigated the molecular biological alterations associated with microglial polarization using a cell proliferation assay, multiplex cytokine bioassays, and immunofluorescence staining. iTBS regimen can improve balance and motor coordination function, increase spontaneous movement, and improve walking function in mice with early cerebral ischemia injury. Expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 increased significantly in mice with MCAO injury. Especially, rTMS significantly increased the number of proliferating cells in the infarcted cortex. The fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in the peri-infarct area of MCAO injured mice was low, but the signal was broader. Compared with MCAO group, the fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in rTMS group was significantly increased. rTMS inhibited pro-inflammatory M1 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD86<sup>+</sup>) and improved anti-inflammatory M2 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup>) in the peri-infarct zone, thus significantly changing the phenotypic ratio M1/M2. rTMS improves motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cerebral I/R injury in mice by regulating microglial polarization.</p>

                Neurons have high energy demands. In a recent study, Looser et al. identified oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 as the activity-dependent driver of oligodendrocyte glycolysis that ensures that lactate is supplied to active neurons. Given that oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 also influenced axonal glucose consumption and uptake, oligodendrocytes may play a broader role in neuronal metabolic regulation.

                In the nervous system, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and, ultimately, behavior through spatiotemporally precise initiation of a variety of signaling pathways. However, despite their critical importance, there is incomplete understanding of how these receptors are regulated to tune their signaling to specific neurophysiological contexts. A deeper mechanistic picture of neuromodulatory GPCR function is needed to fully decipher their biological roles and effectively harness them for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we highlight recent progress in identifying novel modes of regulation of neuromodulatory GPCRs, including G protein- and receptor-targeting mechanisms, receptor–receptor crosstalk, and unique features that emerge in the context of chemical synapses. These emerging principles of neuromodulatory GPCR tuning raise critical questions to be tackled at the molecular, cellular, synaptic, and neural circuit levels in the future.

                Xu and Wang developed a reporter to visualize unfolded protein accumulation in the ER lumen in living cells. Upon unfolded protein binding, this reporter forms fluorescence puncta fast and reversibly, enabling live imaging of ER stress and better understanding of how it correlates with the unfolded protein response.

Reversible sequestration requires the Hsp42 chaperone, providing a mechanism to control a key cellular signaling pathway in a catalytic-isoform-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85914">The interferon-rich skin environment regulates Langerhans cell ADAM17 to promote photosensitivity in lupus</a></h4>

              
                The autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (lupus) is characterized by photosensitivity, where even ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure can lead to development of inflammatory skin lesions. We have previously shown that Langerhans cells (LCs) limit keratinocyte apoptosis and photosensitivity via a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-mediated release of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and that LC ADAM17 sheddase activity is reduced in lupus. Here, we sought to understand how the lupus skin environment contributes to LC ADAM17 dysfunction and, in the process, differentiate between effects on LC ADAM17 sheddase function, LC ADAM17 expression, and LC numbers. We show through transcriptomic analysis a shared IFN-rich environment in non-lesional skin across human lupus and three murine models: MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and imiquimod (IMQ) mice. IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 sheddase activity in murine and human LCs, and IFNAR blockade in lupus model mice restores LC ADAM17 sheddase activity, all without consistent effects on LC ADAM17 protein expression or LC numbers. Anti-IFNAR-mediated LC ADAM17 sheddase function restoration is associated with reduced photosensitive responses that are dependent on EGFR signaling and LC ADAM17. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a known mediator of ADAM17 activity; we show that UVR-induced LC ROS production is reduced in lupus model mice, restored by anti-IFNAR, and is cytoplasmic in origin. Our findings suggest that IFN-I promotes photosensitivity at least in part by inhibiting UVR-induced LC ADAM17 sheddase function and raise the possibility that anifrolumab ameliorates lupus skin disease in part by restoring this function. This work provides insight into IFN-I-mediated disease mechanisms, LC regulation, and a potential mechanism of action for anifrolumab in lupus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62999">A unique multi-synaptic mechanism involving acetylcholine and GABA regulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens through early adolescence in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision making. These behavioral changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. Major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. Here, we utilized fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release as well as mechanisms that underlie differential dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. We show baseline differences between adult and adolescent stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the a6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The a6-selective blocker, a-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B </sub>receptors revealed that this a6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirm the role of a6 nAChR and GABA in mediating this effect <i>in vivo</i> using microdialysis. Results herein suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at a6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

">Modulation of beta oscillatory dynamics in motor and frontal areas during physical fatigue</a></h4>

              
                Beta-band oscillations have been suggested to promote the maintenance of the current motor (or cognitive) set, thus signaling the status quo of the system. While this hypothesis has been reliably demonstrated in many studies, it fails to explain changes in beta-band activity due to the accumulation of physical fatigue. In the current study, we aimed to reconcile the functional role of beta oscillations during physical fatigue within the status quo theory. Using an innovative EEG design, we identified two distinct beta-band power dynamics in the motor areas as fatigue rises: (i) an enhancement at rest, supposedly promoting the resting state, and (ii) a decrease during contraction, thought to reflect the increase in motor cortex activation necessary to cope with the muscular fatigue. We then conducted effective connectivity analyses, which revealed that the modulations during contractions were driven by frontal areas. Finally, we implement a biologically plausible model to replicate and characterize our results mechanistically. Together, our findings anchor the physical fatigue paradigm within the status quo theory, thus shedding light on the functional role of beta oscillations in physical fatigue. We further discuss a unified interpretation that might explain the conflicting evidence previously encountered in the physical fatigue literature.

">Impact of cardiometabolic factors and blood beta-amyloid on the volume of white matter hyperintensities in dementia-free subjects with cognitive complaints</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) in Alzheimer disease (AD) have traditionally been associated with cerebrovascular diseases. Amyloid beta deposition reportedly contributes to WMHs, however, this relationship remains unclear in dementia free subjects with cognitive complaints (CC). Here, we explored the relationship between WMHs and cardiometabolic and amyloid beta blood biomarkers in a community based cohort of Latin American CC participants. Methods: We recruited 112 individuals with CC (69 92 YO, 90 females) with available plasma amyloid beta biomarkers and cardiometabolic markers (systolic diastolic blood pressure and glycaemia). WMHs were quantified using a lesion segmentation tool based on SPM12 and segmented using the John Hopkins University (JHU) Atlas and ALVIN segmentation for periventricular and subcortical white matter. Linear multiple regression models were fitted to assess total WMH lesions and the segmented tract, using demographics, cardiometabolic, and amyloid beta blood biomarker measures as independent variables. Results: After multiple comparison corrections, diastolic blood pressure was associated with WMHs, specifically in the right anterior thalamic radiation, left cingulum, minor forceps, and subcortical ALVIN segmentation. Glycaemia was associated with WMH volume in forceps major, forceps minor, and right fronto occipital fasciculi. Conversely, amyloid beta blood biomarkers and systolic blood pressure showed no association with WMH overall or in specific tracts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that, in dementia free CC individuals, WMH volume was more related to cardiometabolic factors, whereas amyloid beta blood biomarkers might be of less relevance. Dementia prevention strategies in individuals might be a useful focus for managing high peripheral vessel resistance and endothelial damage due to hypertension and hyperglycaemia.

">Echo-locate: Cerebellar activity predicts vocalization in fruit bats</a></h4>

              
                Echolocating bats exhibit remarkable auditory behaviors, enabled by adaptations within and outside their auditory system. Yet, research in echolocating bats has focused mostly on brain areas that belong to the classic ascending auditory pathway. This study provides direct evidence linking the cerebellum, an evolutionarily ancient and non-classic auditory structure, to vocalization and hearing. We report that in the fruit-eating bat Carollia perspicillata, external sounds can evoke cerebellar responses with latencies below 20 ms. Such fast responses are indicative of early inputs to the bat cerebellum. In vocalizing bats, distinct spike train patterns allow the prediction with over 85% accuracy of the sound they are about to produce, or have just produced, i.e., communication calls or echolocation pulses. Taken together, our findings provide evidence of specializations for vocalization and hearing in the cerebellum of an auditory specialist.

">The spatial organization of ascending auditory pathway microstructural maturation from infancy through adolescence using a novel fiber tracking approach</a></h4>

              
                Auditory perception is established through experience-dependent stimuli exposure during sensitive developmental periods; however, little is known regarding the structural development of the central auditory pathway in humans. The present study characterized the regional developmental trajectories of the ascending auditory pathway from the brainstem to the auditory cortex from infancy through adolescence using a novel diffusion MRI-based tractography approach and along-tract analyses. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to quantify the magnitude and timing of auditory pathway microstructural maturation. We found spatially varying patterns of white matter maturation along the length of the tract, with inferior brainstem regions developing earlier than thalamocortical projections and left hemisphere tracts developing earlier than the right. These results help to characterize the processes that give rise to functional auditory processing and may provide a baseline for detecting abnormal development.

">Microglia replacement effectively attenuates the disease progress of ALSP in the mouse model and human patient</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play critical roles in the brain physiology and pathology. CSF1R is primarily expressed in microglia. The mono-allelic CSF1R mutation causes adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a lethal neurological disease and no rational cure in clinical trials. There are no animal models mimicking human ALSP. In this study, we first developed mouse models based on human ALSP hotspot mutations. We then utilized microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) to replace the Csf1r-deficient microglia in ALSP mice by Csf1r-normal donor cells. With pathogenic gene correction, Mr BMT efficiently attenuated the pathologies. Previously, an ALSP patient received traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT) due to a misdiagnosis of metachromatic leukodystrophy. The disease progress was halted for 15 years with unknown reasons. We demonstrated that tBMT in ALSP is equivalent to or close to Mr BMT, achieving efficient microglia replacement and therefore attenuating the ALSP progress in the mouse model. Next, we applied tBMT to replace CSF1R-deficient microglia in human patients. Our clinical results show that after microglia replacement, the ALSP course is effectively halted. Together, microglia replacement corrects the pathogenic gene and thus halts the disease progress in the mouse model and human patients. This study strongly demonstrates clinical potentials of microglia replacement in neurological disease treatments.

">BASOPHILS ACTIVATE PRURICEPTOR-LIKE VAGAL SENSORY NEURONS.</a></h4>

              
                Vagal sensory neurons convey sensations from internal organs along the vagus nerve to the brainstem. Pruriceptors are a subtype of neurons that transmit itch and induce pruritus. Despite extensive research on the molecular mechanisms of itch, studies focusing on pruriceptors in the vagal ganglia still need to be explored. In this study, we characterized vagal pruriceptor neurons by their responsiveness to pruritogens such as lysophosphatidic acid, {beta}-alanine, chloroquine, and the cytokine oncostatin M. We discovered that lung-resident basophils produce oncostatin M and that its release can be induced by engagement of Fc{varepsilon}RI. Oncostatin M then sensitizes multiple populations of vagal sensory neurons, including Tac1+ and MrgprA3+ neurons in the jugular ganglia. Finally, we observed an increase in oncostatin M release in mice sensitized to the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or to the fungal allergen Alternaria alternate, highlighting a novel mechanism through which basophils and vagal sensory neurons may communicate during type I hypersensitivity diseases such as allergic asthma.

                Mammals perform rapid oscillations of their body- "wet dog shakes" -to remove water and irritants from their back hairy skin. The somatosensory mechanisms underlying this stereotypical behavior are unknown. We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were strongly activated by oil droplets and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial (SPB) neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting SPB neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet- and C-LTMR-evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR-spinoparabrachial pathway mediates wet dog shakes for rapid and effective removal of foreign particles from back hairy skin.

                Progress in histological methods and in microscope technology has enabled dense staining and imaging of axons over large brain volumes, but tracing axons over such volumes requires new computational tools for 3D reconstruction of data acquired from serial sections. We have developed a computational pipeline for automated tracing and volume assembly of densely stained axons imaged over serial sections, which leverages machine learning-based segmentation to enable stitching and alignment with the axon traces themselves. We validated this segmentation-driven approach to volume assembly and alignment of individual axons over centimeter-scale serial sections and show the application of the output traces for analysis of local orientation and for proofreading over aligned volumes. The pipeline is scalable, and combined with recent advances in experimental approaches, should enable new studies of mesoscale connectivity and function over the whole human brain.

                Our understanding of how visual cortex neural processes mature during infancy and toddlerhood is limited. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), the present study investigated the development of visual evoked responses (VERs) in both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples of infants and toddlers 2 months to 3 years. Brain space analyses focused on N1m and P1m latency, as well as the N1m-to-P1m amplitude. Associations between VER measures and developmental quotient (DQ) scores in the cognitive/visual and fine motor domains were also examined. Results showed a nonlinear decrease in N1m and P1m latency as a function of age, characterized by rapid changes followed by slower progression, with the N1m latency plateauing at 6-7 months and the P1m latency plateauing at 8-9 months. The N1m-to-P1m amplitude also exhibited a non-linear decrease, with strong responses observed in younger infants (~2-3 months) and then a gradual decline. Associations between N1m and P1m latency and fine motor DQ scores were observed, suggesting that infants with faster visual processing may be better equipped to perform fine motor tasks. The present findings advance our understanding of the maturation of the infant visual system and highlight the relationship between the maturation of visual system and fine motor skills.

">Modeling differences in neurodevelopmental maturity of the reading network using support vector regression on functional connectivity data</a></h4>

              
                The construction of brain growth charts trained to predict age based on morphometric and/or functional properties of the brain ("brain-age prediction") has the potential to inform neuroscientists and clinicians alike about children's neurodevelopmental trajectories. When applied to both typically and atypically-developing populations - such as those with specific learning disorders - results may be informative as to whether a particular condition is associated with atypical maturation of specific brain networks. Here, we focus on the relationship between reading disorder (RD) and maturation of functional connectivity (FC) patterns in the prototypical reading/language network across development using a cross-sectional sample of N = 742 participants aged 6-21 years. A support vector regression model is trained to predict chronological age from FC data derived from (1) a whole-brain model, as well as (2) multiple "reduced" models, which are trained on FC data generated from a successively smaller number of regions in the brain's reading network. We hypothesized that the trained models would show systematic underestimation of brain network maturity (i.e., lower FC-based age predictions) for poor readers, particularly for the models trained with reading/language regions. Exploratory results demonstrated that the most important whole-brain ROIs and connections are derived from the dorsal attention and somatosensory motor networks. Comparisons of the different models' predictions reveal that while the whole-brain model outperforms the others in terms of overall prediction accuracy, all models are effective at predicting brain maturity, including the one trained with the smallest amount of FC data. In addition, all models demonstrate some degree of moderation in the reliability of their age predictions as a function of reading ability, with predictions for both poor and exceptional readers being more accurate relative to those for typical readers.

">Enhancing Retromer Complex Stability Ameliorates Synaptic Dysfunction in a Mouse Model ofAlzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction is an early hallmark of Alzheimers disease, characterized by the disruption of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Central to these processes is endosomal trafficking, mediated by the retromer complex, which orchestrates the movement of vesicle contents for recycling to the plasma membrane, return to the Golgi, or degradation. Variants of VPS35, the cargo recognition component of the retromer complex, have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons disease (PARK17, D620N mutation) and Alzheimers disease (L625P mutation). While substantial research has focused on Parkinsons, the role of VPS35 in Alzheimers has been less explored. This study investigates the acute neuroprotective effects of retromer-stabilizing compounds in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimers. Our results reveal that stabilization of the retromer complex not only mitigates pathogenic production mechanisms but also compensates for early synaptic dysfunction and microglial activation. Specifically, we observed significant modulation of genes involved in long-term potentiation and a reduction in abnormal retromer-associated cargos. These findings highlight the potential of retromer stabilisation as atherapeutic strategy to address fundamental pathological pathological processes in Alzheimers disease

">Longitudinal sex-at-birth and age analyses of cortical structure in the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                While the brain continues to develop during adolescence, such development may depend on sex-at-birth. However, the elucidation of such differences may be hindered by analytical decisions (e.g., covariate selection to address body/brain-size differences) and the typical reporting of cross-sectional data. To further evaluate adolescent cortical development, we analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development StudySM, whose cohort of 11,000+ youth participants with biannual neuroimaging data collection can facilitate understanding neuroanatomical change during a critical developmental window. Doubly considering individual differences in the context of group-level effects, we analyzed regional changes in cortical thickness, sulcal depth, surface area, and volume between two timepoints (~2 years apart) in 9- to 12-year-olds assigned male or female sex-at-birth. First, we conducted linear mixed-effects models to gauge how controlling for intracranial volume, whole-brain volume (WBV), or a summary metric (e.g., mean cortical thickness) influenced interpretations of age-dependent cortical change. Next, we evaluated the relative changes in thickness and surface area as a function of sex-at-birth and age. Here, we showed that WBV (thickness, sulcal depth, volume) and total cortical surface area were more optimal covariates; controlling for different covariates would have substantially altered our interpretations of overall and sex-at-birth-specific neuroanatomical development. Further, we provided evidence to suggest that aggregate change in how cortical thickness is changing relative to surface area is generally comparable across those assigned male or female sex-at-birth, with corresponding change happening at slightly older ages in those assigned male sex-at-birth. Overall, these results help elucidate neuroanatomical developmental trajectories in early adolescence.

">Palytoxin Evokes Reversible Spreading Depolarization in the Locust CNS</a></h4>

              
                Spreading depolarization (SD) describes the near-complete depolarization of CNS neural cells as a consequence of chemical, electrical, and metabolic perturbations. It is well-established as the central mechanism underlying insect coma and various mammalian neurological dysfunctions. Despite significant progress in our understanding, the question remains: which cation channel, if any, generates SD in the CNS? Previously, we speculated that the sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) might function as a large-conductance ion channel to initiate SD in insects, potentially mediated by a palytoxin (PLTX)-like endogenous activator. In the current study, we evaluate the effectiveness and properties of PLTX as an SD initiator in L. migratoria. Whereas bath-applied PLTX failed to ignite SD, direct injection into the neuropil triggered SD in 57% of the preparations. Notably, PLTX-induced SD onset was significantly more rapid compared to ouabain injection and azide controls, though their electrophysiological features remained similar. Furthermore, PLTX-induced SD was recoverable and resulted in a greater frequency of repetitive SD events compared to ouabain. Surprisingly, prior PLTX treatment disrupted the onset and recovery of subsequent SD evoked by other means. PLTX injection could attenuate the amplitude and hasten the onset time of azide-induced SD. Such an effect is associated with a complete inhibition at higher doses of subsequent anoxic SD induced through azide treatment or submersion. These results show that PLTX can trigger repetitive and reversible SD-like events in locusts and simultaneously interfere with anoxic SD occurrence. We suggest that the well-documented NKA pump conversion into an open non-selective cationic channel is a plausible mechanism of SD activation in the locust CNS, warranting additional investigations.

">Endogenous opioids facilitate stress-induced binge eating via an insular cortex-claustrum pathway</a></h4>

              
                Stress has been shown to promote the development and persistence of binge eating behaviors. However, the neural circuit mechanisms for stress-induced binge-eating behaviors are largely unreported. The endogenous dynorphin (dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) opioid neuropeptide system has been well-established to be a crucial mediator of the anhedonic component of stress. Here, we aimed to dissect the basis of dynorphinergic control of stress-induced binge-like eating behavior. We first established a mouse behavioral model for stress-induced binge-like eating behaviors. We found that mice exposed to stress increased their food intake of familiar palatable food (high fat, high sugar, HPD) compared to non-stressed mice. Following a brain-wide analysis, we isolated robust cFos-positive cells in the Claustrum (CLA), a subcortical structure with highly abundant KOR expression, following stress-induced binge-eating behavior. We report that KOR signaling in CLA is necessary for this elevated stress-induced binge eating behavior using local pharmacology and local deletion of KOR. In vivo calcium recordings using fiber photometry revealed a disinhibition circuit structure in the CLA during the initiation of HPD feeding bouts. We further established the dynamics of endogenous dynorphinergic control of this behavior using a genetically encoded dynorphin biosensor, Klight. Combined with 1-photon single-cell calcium imaging, we report significant heterogeneity with the CLA population during stress-induced binge eating and such behavior attenuates local dynorphin tone. Furthermore, we isolate the anterior Insular cortex (aIC) as the potential source of endogenous dynorphin afferents in the CLA. By characterizing neural circuits and peptidergic mechanisms within the CLA, we uncover a pathway that implicates endogenous opioid regulation stress-induced binge eating.

">Universal statistics of hippocampal place fields across species and dimensionalities</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells form a spatial map by selectively firing at specific locations in an animal's environment. Until recently the hippocampus appeared to implement a simple coding scheme for position, in which each neuron is assigned to a single region of space in which it is active. Recently, new experiments revealed that the tuning of hippocampal neurons to space is much less stereotyped than previously thought: in large environments, place cells are active in multiple locations and their fields vary in shape and size across locations, with distributions that differ substantially in different experiments. It is unknown whether these seemingly diverse observations can be explained in a unified manner, and whether the heterogeneous statistics can reveal the mechanisms that determine the tuning of neural activity to position. Here we show that a surprisingly simple mathematical model, in which firing fields are generated by thresholding a realization of a random Gaussian process, explains the statistical properties of neural activity in quantitative detail, in bats and rodents, and in one-, two-, and three-dimensional environments of varying sizes. The model captures the statistics of field arrangements, and further yields quantitative predictions on the statistics of field shapes and topologies, which we verify. Thus, the seemingly diverse statistics arise from mathematical principles that are common to different species and behavioral conditions. The underlying Gaussian statistics are compatible with a picture in which the synaptic connections between place cells and their inputs are random and highly unstructured.

">The Drosophila tyramine-beta-hydroxylase gene encodes multiple isoforms with different functions</a></h4>

              
                The Tyramine-beta-hydroxylase (Tbh) is required for octopamine synthesis. To better understand the function of Tbh in neurotransmitter synthesis, we analyzed the molecular genetic organization of the Drosophila melanogaster Tbh gene and found that the Tbh gene encodes multiple transcripts. The transcripts differ in their 5UTR, which results in proteins that differ in their size and putative phosphorylation sites, suggesting that the Tbh function is regulated at translational and posttranslational levels. We generated a new Tbh mutant - TbhDel3 - using FLP/FRT recombination mutagenesis to remove the translational start site still that is present in TbhnM18mutants. The TbhDel3 mutants share ethanol tolerance and larval locomotion defects with the TbhnM18 mutants. But, they differ in terms of their cellular stress response. To develop normal levels of ethanol tolerance, Tbh is required in a subset of Tbh expressing neurons in the adult brain, which was identified using a newly generated Tbh-Gal4 driver. Taking advantage of a newly generated Tbh antibody serum, we show that one Tbh isoform is expressed in a group of peptidergic Hugin-positive and noradrenergic neurons uncoupling Tbh function from octopamine synthesis. The existence of different functional Tbh isoforms impacts our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitter synthesis and the function of the octopaminergic neurotransmitter system in cellular processes and the regulation of behavior.

	<p>Background: The study aimed to examine the bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and depressive symptoms in a national, community-based cohort study, despite the unclear temporal sequence demonstrated previously. Methods: Data were derived from four waves (2011 baseline and 2013, 2015, and 2018 follow-ups) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A total of 17,708 participants aged 45 years or older who had baseline data on both sarcopenia status and depressive symptoms in 2011 were included in the study. For the two cohort analyses, a total of 8092 adults without depressive symptoms and 11,292 participants without sarcopenia in 2011 were included. Sarcopenia status was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019) criteria. Depressive symptoms were defined as a score of 20 or higher on the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressive Scale (CES-D-10). Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted to examine the risk of depressive symptoms and sarcopenia risk, while cross-lagged panel models were used to examine the temporal sequence between depressive symptoms and sarcopenia over time. Results: During a total of 48,305.1 person-years follow-up, 1262 cases of incident depressive symptoms were identified. Sarcopenia exhibited a dose&amp;amp;ndash;response relationship with a higher risk of depressive symptoms (HR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.3 for sarcopenia, and HR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;1.8 for possible sarcopenia, p trend &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the second cohort analysis, 240 incident sarcopenia cases were identified over 39,621.1 person-years. Depressive symptoms (HR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.0) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing sarcopenia after multivariable adjustment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that depressive symptoms were associated with subsequent sarcopenia (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.003, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Simultaneously, baseline sarcopenia was also associated with subsequent depressive symptoms (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.428, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study identified a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and sarcopenia. It seems more probable that baseline sarcopenia is associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in a stronger pattern than the reverse pathway. The interlinkage indicated that maintaining normal muscle mass and strength may serve as a crucial intervention strategy for alleviating mood disorders.</p>

                <p>Studies on genetic robustness recently revealed transcriptional adaptation (TA) as a mechanism by which an organism can compensate for genetic mutations through activation of homologous genes. Here, we discovered that genetic mutations, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in the amyloid precursor protein-b (<I>appb</I>) gene, activated TA of two other <I>app</I> family members, <I>appa</I> and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 (<I>aplp2</I>), in zebrafish. The observed transcriptional response of <I>appa</I> and <I>aplp2</I> required degradation of mutant mRNA and did not depend on Appb protein level. Furthermore, TA between amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members was observed in human neuronal progenitor cells; however, compensation was only present during early neuronal differentiation and could not be detected in a more differentiated neuronal stage or adult zebrafish brain. Using knockdown and chemical inhibition, we showed that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is involved in degradation of mutant mRNA and that Upf1 and Upf2, key proteins in the NMD pathway, regulate the endogenous transcript levels of <I>appa</I>, <I>appb</I>, <I>aplp1</I>, and <I>aplp2</I>. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression level of App family members is regulated by the NMD pathway and that mutations destabilizing <I>app</I>/<I>APP</I> mRNA can induce genetic compensation by other family members through TA in both zebrafish and human neuronal progenitors.</p>

                <p>Amylin, a pancreatic hormone that is cosecreted with insulin, has been highlighted as a potential treatment target for obesity. Amylin receptors are distributed widely throughout the brain and are coexpressed on mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Activation of amylin receptors is known to reduce food intake, but the neurochemical mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. Amylin receptor activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key dopaminergic nucleus in the mesolimbic reward system, has a potent ability to suppress intake of palatable fat and sugar solutions. Although previous work has demonstrated that VTA amylin receptor activation can dampen mesolimbic dopamine signaling elicited by random delivery of sucrose, whether this is also the case for fat remains unknown. Herein we tested the hypothesis that amylin receptor activation in the VTA of male rats would attenuate dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core in response to random intraoral delivery of either fat or sugar solutions. Results show that fat solution produces a greater potentiation of accumbens dopamine than an isocaloric sucrose solution. Moreover, activation of VTA amylin receptors elicits a more robust suppression of accumbens dopamine signaling in response to fat solution than to sucrose. Taken together these results shed new light on the amylin system as a therapeutic target for obesity and emphasize the reinforcing nature of high-fat/high-sugar diets.</p>

                In 2023 Alkhathami and colleagues from the Prince Sultan Military College of Health Sciences highlighted the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s transformative upgrades across various sectors, notably including enhancements to the healthcare system, and called for action to extend these upgrades to the military healthcare field. Prompted by this call to action, the leadership of the military healthcare system swiftly commenced initiatives, acting in less than three months from this pivotal appeal. In January 2023 the first author ordered a decree via the General Directorate of Armed Forces Medical Services of Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with US central Command and international partners, to host the 3rd International Conference of Military Medicine. The event graciously welcoming more than 1000 military representatives from 20 participating nations. The Military Medical Conference, fostering a global military community dialogue on the necessity to explore collective capacities to endure and overcome humanitarian challenges, thereby sustaining health, promoting well-being, and nurturing life through strategies that align with the insights of Alkhathami et al. (2023). The response and the need underlined by the original article are discussed by the Major General, staff of the Saudi Military Medical Services and academics from the University of Sharjah.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Post-operative sore throat (POST) is one of the most common complaints post-endotracheal intubation and can be decreased through various interventions. This study aimed to determine the effect of fluticasone-impregnated versus saline throat packs on the occurrence and severity of POST and voice hoarseness. Methods This prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial was conducted on patients undergoing nasosinus surgeries at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital. Patients were randomized to groups based on a computer-generated table of random numbers post-intubation after placing a definite length of oropharyngeal packs into group F (fluticasone) who received four puffs of fluticasone furoate-soaked throat packs and group C (control) wherein normal saline-soaked throat packs were used. Determining the incidence of POST and voice hoarseness was the primary outcome; severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores at 24 hours post-surgery and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Results Overall, 86 patients were randomized and 43 patients were included in each group. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 55.8, 55.6, 55.8, 53.4 and 30.2, 28, 28, 28 in group C. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 37.2, 37.2, 37.2, 34.8 and 14, 14, 14,14 in group F at 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours, respectively, however, the p values were not found to be significant at any time interval. There was no significant difference in terms of severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores between the groups and there were no reported adverse events. Conclusions In patients undergoing nasosinus surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, fluticasone furoate-impregnated throat packs failed to show any significant reduction in the incidence and severity of POST as well as hoarseness of voice, and even though it was not statistically significant, the fluticasone impregnated group had higher patient satisfaction scores.

                Background Although numerous case-control studies have examined the role of nitric oxide, particularly the 894G>T polymorphism in the eNOS gene, in increasing the risk of stroke and cancer, there remains a need for a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify these associations. This study aims to address this gap by thoroughly evaluating the relationship between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Methods We conducted an exhaustive search across digital databases including Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2012-2023. A rigorous selection process was employed to include relevant studies, which were then analyzed using robust meta-analytical techniques to determine the association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Results In this meta-analysis, we combined data from 2,013 cases and 2,187 control subjects for cancer risk assessment and 1,006 cases with 1,146 control subjects for stroke risk evaluation. Our findings indicate that the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer when comparing GG vs. GT+TT genotypes. Additionally, there is a notable correlation between this polymorphism and stroke incidence under various genetic models (T vs. G, TT vs. GG + GT, GG + GT vs. TT). Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest a significant association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and increased risks of cancer and stroke. These findings underscore the importance of conducting future studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive analyses further to elucidate the role of nitric oxide in these diseases. This study addresses some concerns but further detailed and non-repetitive research is necessary for conclusive evidence.

                Background The increasing popularity of green cosmetic products among consumers who prioritize skin health, quality, and beauty has driven the production of these products. Growing awareness of harmful toxins in traditional cosmetics is leading consumers to prefer natural alternatives. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing Indian consumers' buying behaviour and purchase intentions toward green cosmetics, focusing on both male and female consumers. Methods To achieve this, a thorough evaluation of the literature from Scopus-indexed journals was conducted, employing the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. The study used Smart PLS 3.0’s structural equation modeling to analyze data and performed a multi-group analysis to explore variations in purchasing intentions and actions between male and female consumers. Results The research indicated an increasing demand for green cosmetics among males in North India. Findings revealed that subjective norms significantly influenced both purchase behaviour and purchase intention. Additionally, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms positively impacted purchase intention, which in turn indirectly affected purchase behaviour. Interestingly, environmental concerns did not influence consumers' actual purchasing intentions or behaviour. The analysis also demonstrated no significant differences between male and female consumers regarding the impact of various factors on their purchase intentions and behaviours. Conclusion These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and marketing managers aiming to promote green cosmetic product purchase behaviour. Recognizing that subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are crucial drivers of purchase intention and behaviour can help in devising effective marketing strategies. Despite the absence of significant gender differences in the factors influencing purchase behaviour, the increasing interest in green cosmetics, especially among males, highlights a broader market potential for these products. This research underscores the importance of focusing on social and behavioural influences to encourage the adoption of green cosmetics

New sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern (VOCs) continuously emerge with mutations in the spike glycoprotein. In most cases, the sublineage-defining mutations vary between the VOCs. It is unclear whether these differences reflect lineage-specific likelihoods for mutations at each spike position or the stochastic nature of their appearance. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 lineages have distinct evolutionary spaces (a probabilistic definition of the sequence states that can be occupied by expanding virus subpopulations). This space can be accurately inferred from the patterns of amino acid variability at the whole-protein level. Robust networks of co-variable sites identify the highest-likelihood mutations in new VOC sublineages and predict remarkably well the emergence of subvariants with resistance mutations to COVID-19 therapeutics. Our studies reveal the contribution of low frequency variant patterns at heterologous sites across the protein to accurate prediction of the changes at each position of interest.

                <p>by Diego Andrés Contreras, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat</p>

Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model’s parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.

                <p>by Florian Bolenz, Thorsten Pachur</p>

Younger and older adults often differ in their risky choices. Theoretical frameworks on human aging point to various cognitive and motivational factors that might underlie these differences. Using a novel computational model based on the framework of resource rationality, we find that the two age groups rely on different strategies. Importantly, older adults did not use simpler strategies than younger adults, they did not select among fewer strategies, they did not make more errors, and they did not put more weight on cognitive costs. Instead, older adults selected strategies that had different risk propensities than those selected by younger adults. Our modeling approach suggests that age differences in risky choice are not necessarily a consequence of cognitive decline; instead, they may reflect motivational differences between age groups.

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the process of transcription through the modulation of different kinetic steps. Although models can often describe the observed transcriptional output of a measured gene, predicting a TFs role on a given promoter requires an understanding of how the TF alters each step of the transcription process. In this work, we use a simple model of transcription to assess the role of promoter identity, and the degree to which TFs alter binding of RNAP (stabilization) and initiation of transcription (acceleration) on three primary characteristics: the range of steady-state regulation, cell-to-cell variability in expression, and the dynamic response time of a regulated gene. We find that steady state regulation and the response time of a gene behave uniquely for TFs that regulate incoherently, i.e that speed up one step but slow the other. We also find that incoherent TFs have dynamic implications, with one type of incoherent mode configuring the promoter to respond more slowly at intermediate TF concentrations. We also demonstrate that the noise of gene expression for these TFs is sensitive to promoter strength, with a distinct non-monotonic profile that is apparent under stronger promoters. Taken together, our work uncovers the coupling between promoters and TF regulatory modes with implications for understanding natural promoters and engineering synthetic gene circuits with desired expression properties.

                <p>by Sebastian Salwig, Jakob Drefs, Jörg Lücke</p>

Conventional and electron microscopy visualize structures in the micrometer to nanometer range, and such visualizations contribute decisively to our understanding of biological processes. Due to different factors in recording processes, microscopy images are subject to noise. Especially at their respective resolution limits, a high degree of noise can negatively effect both image interpretation by experts and further automated processing. However, the deteriorating effects of strong noise can be alleviated to a large extend by image enhancement algorithms. Because of the inherent high noise, a requirement for such algorithms is their applicability directly to noisy images or, in the extreme case, to just a single noisy image without a priori noise level information (referred to as blind zero-shot setting). This work investigates blind zero-shot algorithms for microscopy image denoising. The strategies for denoising applied by the investigated approaches include: filtering methods, recent feed-forward neural networks which were amended to be trainable on noisy images, and recent probabilistic generative models. As datasets we consider transmission electron microscopy images including images of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and fluorescence microscopy images. A natural goal of denoising algorithms is to simultaneously reduce noise while preserving the original image features, e.g., the sharpness of structures. However, in practice, a tradeoff between both aspects often has to be found. Our performance evaluations, therefore, focus not only on noise removal but set noise removal in relation to a metric which is instructive about sharpness. For all considered approaches, we numerically investigate their performance, report their denoising/sharpness tradeoff on different images, and discuss future developments. We observe that, depending on the data, the different algorithms can provide significant advantages or disadvantages in terms of their noise removal vs. sharpness preservation capabilities, which may be very relevant for different virological applications, e.g., virological analysis or image segmentation.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012183">Reliable ligand discrimination in stochastic multistep kinetic proofreading: First passage time vs. product counting strategies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiangting Li, Tom Chou</p>

Cellular signaling, crucial for biological processes like immune response and homeostasis, relies on specificity and fidelity in signal transduction to accurately respond to stimuli amidst biological noise. Kinetic proofreading (KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed steps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially reducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic proofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single state and then define an overall “processing” time required to traverse these states. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic proofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more direct evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological contexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find that loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific strategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time (FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially improve the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an effective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a product concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps do not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing activation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the product-based strategy into a series of FPT-based strategies to better resolve the subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding KPR in the context of how information is extracted and processed in the cell.

As <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> disseminates through its host, the parasite must sense and adapt to its environment and scavenge nutrients. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is one such environmental factor and cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) are evolutionarily conserved O<sub>2</sub> cellular sensing proteins that regulate responses to changes in O<sub>2</sub> availability. <i>Toxoplasma</i> expresses 2 PHDs. One of them, TgPHYa hydroxylates SKP1, a subunit of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In vitro, TgPHYa is important for growth at low O<sub>2</sub> levels. However, studies have yet to examine the role that TgPHYa or any other pathogen-encoded PHD plays in virulence and disease. Using a type II ME49 <i>Toxoplasma</i> TgPHYa knockout, we report that TgPHYa is important for <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence and brain cyst formation in mice. We further find that while TgPHYa mutant parasites can establish an infection in the gut, they are unable to efficiently disseminate to peripheral tissues because the mutant parasites are unable to survive within recruited immune cells. Since this phenotype was abrogated in IFNγ knockout mice, we studied how TgPHYa mediates survival in IFNγ-treated cells. We find that TgPHYa is not required for release of parasite-encoded effectors into host cells that neutralize anti-parasitic processes induced by IFNγ. In contrast, we find that TgPHYa is required for the parasite to scavenge tryptophan, which is an amino acid whose levels are decreased after IFNγ up-regulates the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO). We further find, relative to wild-type mice, that IDO knockout mice display increased morbidity when infected with TgPHYa knockout parasites. Together, these data identify the first parasite mechanism for evading IFNγ-induced nutritional immunity and highlight a novel role that oxygen-sensing proteins play in pathogen growth and virulence.

                <p>by Vanessa M. Adams</p>

There has been an increasingly prevalent message that data regarding costs must be included in conservation planning activities to make cost-efficient decisions. Despite the growing acceptance that socioeconomic context is critical to conservation success, the approaches to embedded economic and financial considerations into planning have not significantly evolved. Inappropriate cost data is frequently included in decisions, with the potential of compromising biodiversity and social outcomes. For each conservation planning step, this essay details common mistakes made when considering costs, proposing solutions to enable conservation managers to know when and how to include costs. Appropriate use of high-quality cost data obtained at the right scale will improve decision-making and ultimately avoid costly mistakes.

                <p>by Laura E. Burnett, Peter Koppensteiner, Olga Symonova, Tomás Masson, Tomas Vega-Zuniga, Ximena Contreras, Thomas Rülicke, Ryuichi Shigemoto, Gaia Novarino, Maximilian Joesch</p>

Despite the diverse genetic origins of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), affected individuals share strikingly similar and correlated behavioural traits that include perceptual and sensory processing challenges. Notably, the severity of these sensory symptoms is often predictive of the expression of other autistic traits. However, the origin of these perceptual deficits remains largely elusive. Here, we show a recurrent impairment in visual threat perception that is similarly impaired in 3 independent mouse models of ASD with different molecular aetiologies. Interestingly, this deficit is associated with reduced avoidance of threatening environments—a nonperceptual trait. Focusing on a common cause of ASDs, the <i>Setd5</i> gene mutation, we define the molecular mechanism. We show that the perceptual impairment is caused by a potassium channel (Kv1)-mediated hypoexcitability in a subcortical node essential for the initiation of escape responses, the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG). Targeted pharmacological Kv1 blockade rescued both perceptual and place avoidance deficits, causally linking seemingly unrelated trait deficits to the dPAG. Furthermore, we show that different molecular mechanisms converge on similar behavioural phenotypes by demonstrating that the autism models <i>Cul3</i> and <i>Ptchd1</i>, despite having similar behavioural phenotypes, differ in their functional and molecular alteration. Our findings reveal a link between rapid perception controlled by subcortical pathways and appropriate learned interactions with the environment and define a nondevelopmental source of such deficits in ASD.

                Background Nintedanib (NTB) is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, been investigated for many disease conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NTB is available as oral capsule formulation, but its ability to detect degradants formed through oxidative, photolytic and hydrolytic processes makes it difficult to quantify. In the current work, a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated. Methods The developed method is simple, precise, reproducible, stable and accurate. The inherent stability of NTB was evaluated using the proposed analytical method approach and force degradation studies were carried out. NTB was separated chromatographically on the Shimadzu C18 column as stationary phase (250 ×4.6 mm, 5 µm) using an isocratic elution method with 0.1% v/v triethyl amine (TEA) in HPLC grade water and acetonitrile (ACN) in the ratio 35:65% v/v. The mobile phase was pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the eluent was detected at 390 nm wavelength. Results NTB was eluted at 6.77±0.00 min of retention time (tR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.999, the developed method was linear in the concentration range of 0.5 µg/ml to 4.5 µg/ml. The recovery rate was found to be in the range of 99.391±0.468% for 1.5 µg/ml concentration. Six replicate standards were determined to have an % RSD of 0.04. Conclusion The formulation excipients didn’t interfere with the determination of NTB, demonstrating the specificity of the developed method. The proposed approach of the analytical method developed can be used to quantify the amount of NTB present in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background: Worldwide, infertility affects about 15% of reproductive-age couples. In many cases, infertility can't be treated, however new treatment options with promising value have been involved in recent clinical trials. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impacts of adding coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to letrozole on the results of spermiogram and sex hormone tests in men diagnosed with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) syndrome, which is a type of male defective spermatogenesis of unknown etiology. Methods: This randomized, open-label, parallel two-arm interventional study included 67 adult male patients aged 18-60 years with a confirmed diagnosis of iOAT syndrome recruited from The High Institute for Infertility Diagnosis & Assisted Reproduction Technologies/Nahrain University. Patients were randomly separated into two groups, Group A included 29 patients treated with letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week, Group B included 38 patients treated with a combination of letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week plus CoQ10 400 mg per day. Both groups completed treatment for three months. Semen samples, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) were analyzed at day one, and at the end of month one, two and three. Results: Both groups showed that sperm concentration, normal morphology, total sperm count and motility, serum testosterone and FSH levels, and T/E2 ratio were significantly increased, while estradiol levels significantly decreased after three months of treatment. Seminal fluid volume changed significantly in group A only. In comparing between the two groups, all measured parameters, apart from sperm motility and FSH level, demonstrated a significant difference after three months of treatment, while sperm volume reached significant value after only two months of therapy. Conclusions: CoQ10 as adjuvant treatment to letrozole effectively improved most of the tested sperm parameters in Iraqi men with iOAT. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05847257, May 6, 2023).

                Background In recent times, the efforts to profile the language characteristics of bilinguals have been extended from mere documentation of proficiency in each language to the determination of language dominance that captures both proficiency and usage (i.e., frequency & contexts) of each language. In multilingual countries, individuals are immersed in various languages in different contexts. With the broader intention to improve the linguistic profiling of bilinguals in countries with similar characteristics, we aimed to adapt and validate the Self-report classification tool in Indian Kannada-English bilinguals. Methods A group of 88 adult Kannada-English bilingual participants self-rated their language proficiency. We measured their language dominance with the adapted tool. Finally, to objectively measure their language abilities, we used the short version of the Bilingual Aphasia Test. Results Discriminant analysis of the ratings showed that the self-report classification tool accurately classified our participants into three groups based on language dominance. Both the self-rating and the objective measure of language proficiency supported the (dominance) classifications by the adapted tool. Conclusion Findings show that the adapted self-report classification tool is valid for determining language dominance in Kannada-English bilinguals. Further, the current study shows that this tool is adaptable to novel bilingual language dyads.

                Background Tissue engineering research aims to address the global shortage of donated corneal tissue, yet challenges persist in clinical translation. This study assesses the pathway from basic research to clinical adoption in corneal tissue engineering. Methods Bibliometric and patent analyses were conducted using the Web of Science-Core Collection and Lens databases to identify top authors, countries, journals, publication trends, inventors, patent statuses, and affiliated companies. A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) analysis compared engineered corneal endothelium to full keratoplasty. A pilot study surveyed thirty ophthalmologist surgeons from eight Latin American countries. Results A strong upward publication trend (R2 = 0.89, p = 1.53x10^-9) in corneal endothelium engineering was observed over the past decade, led by the USA, China, and Japan. Among 614 research papers, 26 patents and 10 companies were identified. Engineered corneal endothelium showed a QALY gain of 0.74 versus 0.07 of corneal transplants. Most survey respondents (97%) expressed interest in adopting engineered corneal endothelium for transplantation if affordability, biocompatibility, and functionality were assured. Conclusions While tissue engineering offers promise in alleviating corneal scarcity, a significant gap remains between scientific advancements and clinical adoption, presenting “death valleys.” Addressing this requires more efficient navigation of the interplay between scientific progress, technology adoption, and clinical practice.

                α-Synuclein (αS) is an abundant presynaptic protein that regulates neurotransmission. It is also a key protein implicated in a broad class of neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Pathological αS deposits in these diseases, Lewy bodies (LBs)/neurites (LNs), contain about 90% of αS in its phospho-serine129 (pS129) form. Therefore, pS129 is widely used as a surrogate marker of pathology. However, recent findings demonstrate that pS129 is also physiologically triggered by neuronal activity to positively regulate synaptic transmission. In this opinion article, we contrast the literature on pathological and physiological pS129, with a special focus on the latter. We emphasize that pS129 is ambiguous and knowledge about the context is necessary to correctly interpret changes in pS129.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86722">Rapid, DNA-induced interface swapping by DNA gyrase</a></h4>

              
                DNA gyrase, a ubiquitous bacterial enzyme, is a type IIA topoisomerase formed by heterotetramerisation of 2 GyrA subunits and 2 GyrB subunits, to form the active complex. DNA gyrase can loop DNA around the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of GyrA and pass one DNA duplex through a transient double-strand break (DSB) established in another duplex. This results in the conversion from a positive (+1) to a negative (–1) supercoil, thereby introducing negative supercoiling into the bacterial genome by steps of 2, an activity essential for DNA replication and transcription. The strong protein interface in the GyrA dimer must be broken to allow passage of the transported DNA segment and it is generally assumed that the interface is usually stable and only opens when DNA is transported, to prevent the introduction of deleterious DSBs in the genome. In this paper, we show that DNA gyrase can exchange its DNA-cleaving interfaces between two active heterotetramers. This so-called interface ‘swapping’ (IS) can occur within a few minutes in solution. We also show that bending of DNA by gyrase is essential for cleavage but not for DNA binding per se and favors IS. Interface swapping is also favored by DNA wrapping and an excess of GyrB. We suggest that proximity, promoted by GyrB oligomerization and binding and wrapping along a length of DNA, between two heterotetramers favors rapid interface swapping. This swapping does not require ATP, occurs in the presence of fluoroquinolones, and raises the possibility of non-homologous recombination solely through gyrase activity. The ability of gyrase to undergo interface swapping explains how gyrase heterodimers, containing a single active-site tyrosine, can carry out double-strand passage reactions and therefore suggests an alternative explanation to the recently proposed ‘swivelling’ mechanism for DNA gyrase (Gubaev et al., 2016).

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91532">Deciphering the genetic code of neuronal type connectivity through bilinear modeling</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how different neuronal types connect and communicate is critical to interpreting brain function and behavior. However, it has remained a formidable challenge to decipher the genetic underpinnings that dictate the specific connections formed between neuronal types. To address this, we propose a novel bilinear modeling approach that leverages the architecture similar to that of recommendation systems. Our model transforms the gene expressions of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal types, obtained from single-cell transcriptomics, into a covariance matrix. The objective is to construct this covariance matrix that closely mirrors a connectivity matrix, derived from connectomic data, reflecting the known anatomical connections between these neuronal types. When tested on a dataset of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, our model achieved a performance comparable to, if slightly better than, the previously proposed spatial connectome model (SCM) in reconstructing electrical synaptic connectivity based on gene expressions. Through a comparative analysis, our model not only captured all genetic interactions identified by the SCM but also inferred additional ones. Applied to a mouse retinal neuronal dataset, the bilinear model successfully recapitulated recognized connectivity motifs between bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, and provided interpretable insights into genetic interactions shaping the connectivity. Specifically, it identified unique genetic signatures associated with different connectivity motifs, including genes important to cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation, highlighting their role in orchestrating specific synaptic connections between these neurons. Our work establishes an innovative computational strategy for decoding the genetic programming of neuronal type connectivity. It not only sets a new benchmark for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of synaptic connections but also paves the way for mechanistic studies of neural circuit assembly and genetic manipulation of circuit wiring.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95856">Obox4 promotes zygotic genome activation upon loss of Dux</a></h4>

              
                Once fertilized, mouse zygotes rapidly proceed to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), during which long terminal repeats (LTRs) of murine endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer (MERVL) are activated by a conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor, DUX. However, <i>Dux</i>-knockout embryos produce fertile mice, suggesting that ZGA is redundantly driven by an unknown factor(s). Here we present multiple lines of evidence that the multicopy homeobox gene, <i>Obox4</i>, encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse 2-cell embryos and redundantly drives ZGA. Genome-wide profiling revealed that OBOX4 specifically binds and activates MERVL LTRs as well as a subset of murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK) LTRs. Depletion of<i> Obox4 </i>is tolerated by embryogenesis, whereas concomitant <i>Obox4</i>/<i>Dux</i> depletion markedly compromises embryonic development. Our study identified OBOX4 as a transcription factor that provides genetic redundancy to pre-implantation development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88942">Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cavernous tissues reveals the key roles of pericytes in diabetic erectile dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40–70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh)<i>,</i> in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95297">Secreted antigen A peptidoglycan hydrolase is essential for Enterococcus faecium cell separation and priming of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy</a></h4>

              
                <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is a microbiota species in humans that can modulate host immunity (Griffin and Hang, 2022), but has also acquired antibiotic resistance and is a major cause of hospital-associated infections (Van Tyne and Gilmore, 2014). Notably, diverse strains of <i>E. faecium</i> produce SagA, a highly conserved peptidoglycan hydrolase that is sufficient to promote intestinal immunity (Rangan et al., 2016; Pedicord et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019) and immune checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity (Griffin et al., 2021). However, the functions of SagA in <i>E. faecium</i> were unknown. Here, we report that deletion of <i>sagA</i> impaired <i>E. faecium</i> growth and resulted in bulged and clustered enterococci due to defective peptidoglycan cleavage and cell separation. Moreover, Δ<i>sagA</i> showed increased antibiotic sensitivity, yielded lower levels of active muropeptides, displayed reduced activation of the peptidoglycan pattern-recognition receptor NOD2, and failed to promote cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the plasmid-based expression of SagA, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, restored Δ<i>sagA</i> growth, production of active muropeptides, and NOD2 activation. SagA is, therefore, essential for <i>E. faecium</i> growth, stress resistance, and activation of host immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93094">7,8-Dihydroxyflavone is a direct inhibitor of human and murine pyridoxal phosphatase</a></h4>

              
                Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91876">Defective mesenchymal Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling causes congenital pulmonary cysts</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97489">Convergence of inputs from the basal ganglia with layer 5 of motor cortex and cerebellum in mouse motor thalamus</a></h4>

              
                A key to motor control is the motor thalamus, where several inputs converge. One excitatory input originates from layer 5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>), while another arises from the deep cerebellar nuclei (Cb). M1<sub>L5</sub> terminals distribute throughout the motor thalamus and overlap with GABAergic inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In contrast, it is thought that Cb and basal ganglia inputs are segregated. Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential function of the GABAergic inputs from basal ganglia is to selectively inhibit, or gate, excitatory signals from M1<sub>L5</sub> in the motor thalamus. Here, we tested this possibility and determined the circuit organization of mouse (both sexes) motor thalamus using an optogenetic strategy in acute slices. First, we demonstrated the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1<sub>L5</sub> through motor thalamus. Importantly, we discovered that GABAergic inputs from the GPi and SNr converge onto single motor thalamic cells with excitatory synapses from M1<sub>L5</sub>. Separately, we also demonstrate that, perhaps unexpectedly, GABAergic GPi and SNr inputs converge with those from the Cb. We interpret these results to indicate that a role of the basal ganglia is to gate the thalamic transmission of M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb information to cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92673">Cell-autonomous role of leucine-rich repeat kinase in the protection of dopaminergic neuron survival</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD and degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via a toxic gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mechanism is unresolved and has pivotal implications for LRRK2-based PD therapies. In this study, we investigate whether <i>Lrrk2</i> and its functional homolog <i>Lrrk1</i> play a cell-intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <i>Lrrk</i> conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. Unlike <i>Lrrk</i> germline DKO mice, DA neuron-restricted <i>Lrrk</i> cDKO mice exhibit normal mortality but develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons, as shown by the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) at the ages of 20 and 24 months. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases in apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc as well as decreases in DA terminals in the striatum, and is preceded by impaired motor coordination. Taken together, these findings provide the unequivocal evidence for the cell-intrinsic requirement of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair its protection of DA neurons, leading to DA neurodegeneration in PD.

	<p>The endocannabinoid system has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, because it plays a neuromodulator role in the central nervous system. In this sense, cannabinoids have been used off-label for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHA), as well as in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), a more prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Thus, this study aims, through a comprehensive literature review, to arrive at a better understanding of the impact of cannabinoids in the therapeutic treatment of patients with ASD, ADHD, and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Overall, cannabis products rich in CBD displayed a higher therapeutic potential for ASD children, while cannabis products rich in THC have been tested more for AD therapy. For ADHD, the clinical studies are incipient and inconclusive, but promising. In general, the main limitations of the clinical studies are the lack of standardization of the cannabis-based products consumed by the participants, a lack of scientific rigor, and the small number of participants.</p>

	<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its potential to modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and evoke cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which are crucial in conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This study explores the impact of tES on the neurovascular unit (NVU), employing a physiological modeling approach to simulate the vascular response to electric fields generated by tES. Utilizing the FitzHugh&amp;amp;ndash;Nagumo model for neuroelectrical activity, we demonstrate how tES can initiate vascular responses such as vasoconstriction followed by delayed vasodilation in cerebral arterioles, potentially modulated by a combination of local metabolic demands and autonomic regulation (pivotal locus coeruleus). Here, four distinct pathways within the NVU were modeled to reflect the complex interplay between synaptic activity, astrocytic influences, perivascular potassium dynamics, and smooth muscle cell responses. Modal analysis revealed characteristic dynamics of these pathways, suggesting that oscillatory tES may finely tune the vascular tone by modulating the stiffness and elasticity of blood vessel walls, possibly by also impacting endothelial glycocalyx function. The findings underscore the therapeutic potential vis-&amp;amp;agrave;-vis blood-brain barrier safety of tES in modulating neurovascular coupling and cognitive function needing the precise modulation of NVU dynamics. This technology review supports the human-in-the-loop integration of tES leveraging digital health technologies for the personalized management of cerebral blood flow, offering new avenues for treating vascular cognitive disorders. Future studies should aim to optimize tES parameters using computational modeling and validate these models in clinical settings, enhancing the understanding of tES in neurovascular health.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastropod molluscs such as <i>Aplysia</i>, <i>Lymnaea</i>, and <i>Tritonia</i> have been important for determining fundamental rules of motor control, learning, and memory because of their large, individually identifiable neurons. Yet only a small number of gastropod neurons have known molecular markers, limiting the ability to establish brain-wide structure–function relations. Here we combine high-throughput, single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization chain reaction in the nudibranch <i>Berghia stephanieae</i> to identify and visualize the expression of markers for cell types. Broad neuronal classes were characterized by genes associated with neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA, as well as neuropeptides. These classes were subdivided by other genes including transcriptional regulators and unannotated genes. Marker genes expressed by neurons and glia formed discrete, previously unrecognized regions within and between ganglia. This study provides the foundation for understanding the fundamental cellular organization of gastropod nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria play critical roles in neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and fate decisions. The subcellular localization of mitochondria in neural stem/progenitor cells during mitosis potentially influences the distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and thus their fates. Therefore, understanding the spatial dynamics of mitochondria provides important knowledge about brain development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of mitochondria in the fetal human neocortex with a particular focus on the basal radial glial cells (bRGCs), a neural stem/progenitor cell subtype attributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex. During interphase, bRGCs exhibit a polarized localization of mitochondria that is localized at the base of the process or the proximal part of the process. Thereafter, mitochondria in bRGCs at metaphase show unpolarized distribution in which the mitochondria are randomly localized in the cytoplasm. During anaphase and telophase, mitochondria are still localized evenly, but mainly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. Mitochondria start to accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. These results suggest that the mitochondrial localization in bRGCs is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, which may ensure the proper distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and, thus in turn, influence their fates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For postmetamorphic specimens of amphioxus (Cephalochordata), serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the long-ignored Rohde-like cells (RLCs) at the extreme posterior end of the dorsal nerve cord. These cells, numbering about three dozen in all, are divisible into a group with larger diameters running near the dorsal side of the cord and a more ventral group with smaller diameters closely associated with the central canal of the neurocoel. It is possible that the smaller ventral cells might be generated at the ependymal zone of the dorsal nerve cord and later migrate to a dorsal position, although a functional reason for this remains a mystery. All the RLCs have conspicuous regions of microvilli covering as much as 40% of their surface; limited data (by others) on the more anterior bona fide Rohde cells also indicate an extensive microvillar surface. Thus, both the RLCs and the better-known Rohde cells appear to be rhabdomeric photoreceptors, although a specific function for this feature is currently unknown. Even more perplexingly, although the Rohde cells are quintessential neurons extending giant processes, each RLC comprises a perikaryon that does not bear any neurites.</p>

	<p>As the population ages worldwide, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent kind of neurodegenerative disorder among older people, has become a significant factor affecting quality of life, public health, and economies. However, the exact pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s remains elusive, and existing highly recognized pathogenesis includes the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Tau neurofibrillary tangles hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis. The major diagnoses of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease include neuroimaging positron emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid molecular diagnosis. The therapy of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease primarily relies on drugs, and the approved drugs on the market include acetylcholinesterase drugs, glutamate receptor antagonists, and amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; monoclonal antibodies. Still, the existing drugs can only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and cannot completely reverse it. This review aims to summarize existing research results on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and drug therapy, with the objective of facilitating future research in this area.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain arises from injuries to the nervous system in diseases such as diabetes, infections, toxicity, and traumas. The underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain involves peripheral and central pathological modifications. Peripheral mechanisms entail nerve damage, leading to neuronal hypersensitivity and ectopic action potentials. Central sensitization involves a neuropathological process with increased responsiveness of the nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) to their normal or subthreshold input due to persistent stimuli, leading to sustained electrical discharge, synaptic plasticity, and aberrant processing in the CNS. Current treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, aim to alleviate symptoms but often face challenges due to the complexity of neuropathic pain. Neuromodulation is emerging as an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients unresponsive to common therapies, by promoting the normalization of neuronal and/or glial activity and by targeting cerebral cortical regions, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and nerve endings. Having a better understanding of the efficacy, adverse events and applicability of neuromodulation through pre-clinical studies is of great importance. Unveiling the mechanisms and characteristics of neuromodulation to manage neuropathic pain is essential to understand how to use it. In the present article, we review the current understanding supporting dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord neuromodulation as a therapeutic approach for neuropathic pain.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the long-term consequences of the virus, particularly the persistent symptoms that characterize long COVID. This syndrome, which can last for months after the initial infection, includes a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have significant implications for brain health and dementia research. This review explores the current understanding of long COVID&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and their potential impact on brain stimulation and neuroimaging studies. It argues that researchers must adapt their study designs and screening processes to account for the confounding effects of long COVID and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their findings. To advance the understanding of this condition and its long-term effects on brain health, the review proposes a series of strategies, including the development of standardized screening tools, the investigation of underlying mechanisms, and the identification of risk factors and protective factors. It also emphasizes the importance of collaborative research efforts and international data sharing platforms in accelerating the pace of discovery and developing targeted interventions for individuals with long COVID. As the prevalence of this condition continues to grow, it is imperative that the neuroscience community comes together to address this challenge and support those affected by long COVID.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0286-23.2024?rss=1">Large Individual Differences in Functional Connectivity in the Context of Major Depression and Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical studies of major depression (MD) generally focus on group effects, yet interindividual differences in brain function are increasingly recognized as important and may even impact effect sizes related to group effects. Here, we examine the magnitude of individual differences in relation to group differences that are commonly investigated (e.g., related to MD diagnosis and treatment response). Functional MRI data from 107 participants (63 female, 44 male) were collected at baseline, 2, and 8&nbsp;weeks during which patients received pharmacotherapy (escitalopram, <I>N</I> = 68) and controls (<I>N</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;39) received no intervention. The unique contributions of different sources of variation were examined by calculating how much variance in functional connectivity was shared across all participants and sessions, within/across groups (patients vs controls, responders vs nonresponders, female vs male participants), recording sessions, and individuals. Individual differences and common connectivity across groups, sessions, and participants contributed most to the explained variance (&gt;95% across analyses). Group differences related to MD diagnosis, treatment response, and biological sex made significant but small contributions (0.3&ndash;1.2%). High individual variation was present in cognitive control and attention areas, while low individual variation characterized primary sensorimotor regions. Group differences were much smaller than individual differences in the context of MD and its treatment. These results could be linked to the variable findings and difficulty translating research on MD to clinical practice. Future research should examine brain features with low and high individual variation in relation to psychiatric symptoms and treatment trajectories to explore the clinical relevance of the individual differences identified here.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity stabilizes firing rates of neurons, but the pressure to restore low activity rates can significantly alter synaptic and cellular properties. Most previous studies of homeostatic readjustment to complete activity silencing in rodent forebrain have examined changes after 2&nbsp;d of deprivation, but it is known that longer periods of deprivation can produce adverse effects. To better understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to address how presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments change during homeostatic plasticity, we subjected mouse cortical slice cultures to a more severe 5&nbsp;d deprivation paradigm. We developed and validated a computational framework to measure the number and morphology of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from super-resolution light microscopy images of dense cortical tissue. Using these tools, combined with electrophysiological miniature excitatory postsynaptic current measurements, and synaptic imaging at the electron microscopy level, we assessed the functional and morphological results of prolonged deprivation. Excitatory synapses were strengthened both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Surprisingly, we also observed a decrement in the density of excitatory synapses, both as measured from colocalized staining of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in tissue and from the number of dendritic spines. Overall, our results suggest that cortical networks deprived of activity progressively move toward a smaller population of stronger synapses.</p>

                Background Non-union fractures can be prevented with bone grafts, such as hydroxyapatite made from green mussel shells. Green mussel shells contain a high percentage of HA, making them a promising alternative for bone healing. This research aims to reveal the effectiveness of green mussel shell HA as a bone substitute material and to provide knowledge for further research. Methods This research was conducted for four months using a true experimental research method with a post-test-only control group design. This study used 36 New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) which were divided into 9 groups: positive control, negative control, and intervention at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after the intervention. All groups were subjected to three general procedures: pre-surgery, surgery, and post-surgery. This study utilized histological evaluation and biochemical assessment, specifically measuring serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) from green mussel shells on bone healing in rabbits. Results The findings demonstrated that green mussel shell HA hashad efficacy in accelerating bone healing, better than HA bovine HA i.e. green mussel shell hydroxyapatite showed superior efficacy compared to bovine hydroxyapatite in accelerating and maximizing fracture healing, as compared to the 6-week negative control group and demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusions Green mussel hydroxyapatite is proven to be able to fasten and maximize the bone healing process as fast as bovine HA, and even has higher efficacy than bovine HA.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, travelling long distances, long waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions The study highlighted barriers related to the availability and accessibility dimension of access to health care, indicating that care for HPT and T2D is often inaccessible, with women often unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is a pressing need for further research on access to healthcare for obesity, T2D, and HPT for women in South Africa, particularly among women who bear a disproportionately high burden of these conditions.

                Background High work pressure and complex problems during the COVID-19 pandemic caused nursing staff, including first-line managers, experienced burnout. Objective This study aims to explore burnout experienced of first-line managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This qualitative descriptive study used thematic analysis. Twelve first-line managers were selected using purposive sampling from two government hospitals, designated as COVID-19 referral centres in Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia. Data were collected through semi-structured online face-to-face interviews using ZOOM meeting video with a guideline interview. Results Exploration of first-line manager’s burnout revealed three themes: 1) unpreparedness, 2) impact on wellbeing, and 3) resilience. Conclusion The first-line managers experienced burnout during the pandemic due to obstacles in implementing management roles and functions accompanied. Their burnout was caused by the unpreparedness of both the hospital management and the community. Their burnout has an impact on their emotional and physical well-being. By this time, the first-line manager’s resilience was formed because they used adaptive coping mechanisms and had a good support system. The experience during COVID-19 should be a lesson learned to strengthen the healthcare system in the future. Risk management mitigation must be systematically and routinely performed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-601/v1?src=rss">A Case Study on Measuring AI Assistant Competence in Narrative Interviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-600/v1?src=rss">Occupation-related antecedents, job-related outcomes, and intervening factors of mental health disorders among food handlers: A scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Mental health and work are closely interlinked. Evidence suggests that food handlers suffer from poor mental health across the globe. A job in the food service sector is emotionally demanding as employees directly interact with customers who insist on impeccable services and real-time responses. The causes of mental health conditions among food handlers are multifactorial. Studies on the antecedents, outcomes, and intervening factors of foodservice employees’ mental health are fragmented and sparse. Objective We aimed to explore the existing literature describing the antecedents and outcomes of mental health disorders among food handlers. Moreover, we also aimed to explore various contextual factors that directly or indirectly influence the relationship between multiple antecedents and outcomes of food handlers’ mental health. Inclusion criteria Studies that focus on identifying the antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors that influence the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of food handlers’ mental health will be included in the scoping review. Methods This scoping review will follow Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework: 1) identifying the research question; 2) identifying relevant studies; 3) study selection; 4) charting the data; and 5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results. Comprehensive searches will be conducted in databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using relevant keywords. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria that focused on antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors influencing the mental health of food handlers will be selected. Data will be extracted and charted in electronic form. The findings will be narratively summarized and thematically analyzed to answer the research questions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012214">Strong association between genomic 3D structure and CRISPR cleavage efficiency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shaked Bergman, Tamir Tuller</p>

CRISPR is a gene editing technology which enables precise in-vivo genome editing; but its potential is hampered by its relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Improving CRISPR’s on-target and off-target effects requires a better understanding of its mechanism and determinants. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the chromosomal 3D spatial structure’s association with CRISPR’s cleavage efficiency, and its predictive capabilities. We used high-resolution Hi-C data to estimate the 3D distance between different regions in the human genome and utilized these spatial properties to generate 3D-based features, characterizing each region’s density. We evaluated these features based on empirical, in-vivo CRISPR efficiency data and compared them to 425 features used in state-of-the-art models. The 3D features ranked in the top 13% of the features, and significantly improved the predictive power of LASSO and xgboost models trained with these features. The features indicated that sites with lower spatial density demonstrated higher efficiency. Understanding how CRISPR is affected by the 3D DNA structure provides insight into CRISPR’s mechanism in general and improves our ability to correctly predict CRISPR’s cleavage as well as design sgRNAs for therapeutic and scientific use.
