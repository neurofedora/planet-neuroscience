              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15871">Autonomic Arousal in Social Anxiety: An Electrodermal Activity Study During an Emotionally Salient Cognitive Task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with heightened physiological arousal in social-evaluative contexts, but it remains unclear whether such autonomic reactivity extends to non-evaluative cognitive stressors. This study investigated electrodermal activity (EDA) patterns in socially anxious (SA) and non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals during an emotionally salient 2-back working memory task using facial expressions. 50 participants (25 SA, 25 NSA) completed both a baseline rest period and the task while EDA data were collected via the Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor. A range of EDA features, such as tonic and phasic components, number and amplitude of skin conductance responses, and sympathetic activation estimates, were analyzed using a standardized, interval-based approach. Results revealed significant increases in EDA across all participants from baseline to task, indicating elevated autonomic arousal during cognitive load. However, no significant group differences were found between SA and NSA individuals. These findings suggest that cognitive-emotional stress, in the absence of social-evaluative threat, elicits comparable physiological responses regardless of social anxiety status. The results underscore the context-dependent nature of anxiety-related autonomic reactivity and advocate for the inclusion of social-evaluative or recovery phases in future research to detect more nuanced group effects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16080">Interpretable Embeddings of Speech Enhance and Explain Brain Encoding Performance of Audio Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models (SSMs) are increasingly hailed as more powerful computational models of human speech perception than models based on traditional hand-crafted features. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic Question-Answering features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SSMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying the shared and unique neural variance captured by each feature class. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, our interpretable model predicted electrocorticography (ECoG) responses to speech more accurately than any SSM. Moreover, augmenting SSM representations with interpretable features yielded the best overall neural predictions, significantly outperforming either class alone. Further variance-partitioning analyses revealed previously unresolved components of SSM representations that contribute to their neural alignment: 1. Despite the common assumption that later layers of SSMs discard low-level acoustic information, these models compress and preferentially retain frequency bands critical for neural encoding of speech (100-1000 Hz). 2. Contrary to previous claims, SSMs encode brain-relevant semantic information that cannot be reduced to lower-level features, improving with context length and model size. These results highlight the importance of using refined, interpretable features in understanding speech perception.

                arXiv:2507.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity is a ubiquitous concept in contemporary science and everyday life. A complex dynamical system is usually characterized by a blend of order and disorder, as well as emergent phenomena that often span multiple temporal and spatial scales. The information processes related to different cognitive processes in the brain can be studied in light of statistical differences based on complexity measures of the electrophysiological time series from different trial types. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a symbolic information approach can be a valuable tool for discriminating response-related differences between Go and NoGo trials using the local field potential of brain regions in monkeys. The method shows significant differences between trial types earlier than the simple average of the electrical signals. Here, we analyze human electroencephalogram data during a Go/NoGo task using information-theoretical quantifiers, including entropy and complexity. We employ the Bandt-Pompe symbolization methodology to determine a probability distribution function for each time series and then to calculate information theory indices. We show that a few channels, especially a central and an occipital electrode, consistently differentiate Go/NoGo trials at the individual level. We also show that different trial types occupy separate regions in the complexity-entropy plane. Our method also captures specific time windows to better differentiate the trial type. Moreover, we show that our results are robust at the group level, considering the average activity of all subjects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16598">Depression as a disorder of distributional coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major depressive disorder persistently stands as a major public health problem. While some progress has been made toward effective treatments, the neural mechanisms that give rise to the disorder remain poorly understood. In this Perspective, we put forward a new theory of the pathophysiology of depression. More precisely, we spotlight three previously separate bodies of research, showing how they can be fit together into a previously overlooked larger picture. The first piece of the puzzle is provided by pathophysiology research implicating dopamine in depression. The second piece, coming from computational psychiatry, links depression with a special form of reinforcement learning. The third and final piece involves recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and basic neuroscience research, indicating that the brain may represent value using a distributional code. Fitting these three pieces together yields a new model of depression's pathophysiology, which spans circuit, systems, computational and behavioral levels, opening up new directions for research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16674">GASPnet: Global Agreement to Synchronize Phases</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image. Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

                arXiv:2211.10542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to analyze dynamically changing brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components through the Hodge decomposition. We propose to quantify the magnitude and relative strength of each component. We performed extensive simulation studies with known ground truth. The Hodge decomposition is then applied to the dynamically changing human brain networks obtained from a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Our results indicate that the components of the Hodge decomposition contain biologically interpretable topological features that provide statistically significant findings not easily captured by traditional methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16495">Spiking neurons as predictive controllers of linear systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.

                arXiv:2507.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.

Abstract: Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency (VAT) is a widely used unsupervised technique to assess the presence of cluster structure in unlabeled datasets. However, its standard implementation suffers from significant performance limitations due to its O(n^2) time complexity and inefficient memory usage. In this work, we present Fast-VAT, a high-performance reimplementation of the VAT algorithm in Python, augmented with Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and Cython's static typing and low-level memory optimizations. Our approach achieves up to 50x speedup over the baseline implementation, while preserving the output fidelity of the original method. We validate Fast-VAT on a suite of real and synthetic datasets -- including Iris, Mall Customers, and Spotify subsets -- and verify cluster tendency using Hopkins statistics, PCA, and t-SNE. Additionally, we compare VAT's structural insights with clustering results from DBSCAN and K-Means to confirm its reliability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21512">Assessing an evolutionary search engine for small language models, prompts, and evaluation metrics</a></h4>

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g., instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI interaction patterns.

                <p>by Ruihao Gong, Zijian Feng, Yanyun Zhang</p>

The resurgence of H5Nx reassortment has caused multiple epidemics resulting in severe disease even death in wild birds and poultry. Assessing H5Nx reassortment risk is crucial for designing targeted interventions and enhancing preparedness efforts to manage H5Nx outbreaks effectively. However, the complexity in H5Nx reassortment, driven by the diversity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and wide range of hosts, has hindered the effective quantification of reassortment risk. In this study, we utilized a network approach to explore the reassortment history using a large-scale dataset. By inferring genomic homogeneity among IAVs, we constructed an IAVs homologous network with reassortment history embedded within it. We estimated the communities within the IAVs homologous network to represent the reassortment risk of various viruses, revealing diverse reassortment risks across different H5Nx viruses. Our analysis also identified the primary hosts contributing to reassortment: domestic poultry in China, and wild birds in North America and Europe. These primary hosts are critical targets for future H5Nx reassortment interventions. Our study provides a framework for quantifying and ranking H5Nx reassortment risk, contributing to enhanced preparedness and prevention efforts.

                <p>by Shingo Gibo, Teiji Kunihiro, Tetsuo Hatsuda, Gen Kurosawa</p>

Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explore the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra, van der Pol models, and a realistic model for mammalian circadian rhythms. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.

                <p>by Shunxiang Fan, Tim Newbold, Jan C. Axmacher, Charlotte L. Outhwaite, Yi Zou, Zhenrong Yu, Yunhui Liu</p>

Nitrogen (N) deposition is known to strongly modify biogeochemical cycles and trophic interactions, in turn altering ecosystem functioning and plant diversity around the globe. However, our understanding of N deposition effects on arthropod diversity remains limited. Here, we investigate how N deposition impacts the diversity of arthropods by combining biodiversity data from the PREDICTS database with data on global N deposition and land cover using mixed-effects models. We then explore the potential for semi-natural and natural habitats (‘SNH’) to buffer against potential N deposition-linked biodiversity losses. N deposition has a negative effect on arthropod biodiversity. Both, species richness and abundance are significantly reduced in areas of high levels of N deposition when compared to areas of low N deposition, with responses varying across different land-use types. The strongest negative effects of N deposition on arthropod diversity were observed in locations where the local land use entails the least anthropogenic modification. At the same time, with the exception of cropland-dominated landscapes, increases in the amount of SNH in the surrounding landscape reduced arthropod biodiversity losses associated with N deposition. We conclude that SNH can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of N deposition on arthropod diversity, with the conservation and creation of these habitats promoting arthropod diversity even under high levels of N deposition.

                <p>by Christoph Binsfeld, Roberto Olayo-Alarcon, Lucía Pérez Jiménez, Morgane Wartel, Mara Stadler, André Mateus, Christian Müller, Ana Rita Brochado</p>

In Gram-negative bacteria, the uptake and export of a wide range of molecules, including antibiotics, is facilitated by porins and efflux pumps. Because of their role in regulating small molecule permeability of the outer and inner membrane, these transport machineries are tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, regulation of transport by external chemical cues remains poorly understood. Here we investigated transcriptional regulation of three prominent transporter genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> across 94 defined chemical cues, and simultaneously mapped the contributions of the key regulators MarA, SoxS and Rob to promoter activity. One third of all tested compounds triggered transcriptional changes, the majority of which were previously unknown. Importantly, we exposed main drivers of transport control in <i>E. coli</i>, e.g., bacteriostatic but not bactericidal antibiotics trigger the expression of efflux pumps, and Rob contributes to ~1/3 of all measured transcriptional changes, thereby emerging as a more prominent regulator of transport than previously thought. We showcase the potential of our resource by elucidating the molecular mechanism of antibiotic antagonisms with widely consumed caffeine in <i>E. coli</i>. Altogether, our analysis provides a quantitative overview of how different regulators orchestrate the transcriptional response of major transport determinants to environmental chemical cues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96421">Balancing reaction-diffusion network for cell polarization pattern with stability and asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                Cell polarization is a critical process that separates molecular species into two distinct regions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, guiding biological processes such as cell division and cell differentiation. Although several underlying antagonistic reaction-diffusion networks capable of setting up cell polarization have been identified experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of how to manipulate pattern stability and asymmetry remains incomplete, especially when only a subset of network components is known. Here, we present numerical results to show that the polarized pattern of an antagonistic 2-node network collapses into a homogeneous state when subjected to single-sided self-regulation, single-sided additional regulation, or unequal system parameters. However, polarity restoration can be achieved by combining two modifications with opposing effects. Additionally, spatially inhomogeneous parameters favoring respective domains stabilize their interface at designated locations. To connect our findings to cell polarity studies of the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> zygote, we reconstituted a 5-node network where a 4-node circuit with full mutual inhibitions between anterior and posterior is modified by a mutual activation in the anterior and an additional mutual inhibition between the anterior and posterior. Once again, a generic set of kinetic parameters moves the interface towards either the anterior or posterior end, yet a polarized pattern can be stabilized through tuning of one or more parameters coupled to intracellular or extracellular spatial cues. A user-friendly software, <i>PolarSim</i>, is constructed to facilitate the exploration of networks with alternative node numbers, parameter values, and regulatory pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93170">Metastatic small cell lung cancer arises from TP53/RB1-deficient and MYC overproduction hESC-derived PNECs</a></h4>

              
                We previously described our initial efforts to develop a model for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that were differentiated to form pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), a putative cell of origin for neuroendocrine-positive SCLC. Although reduced expression of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1 allowed the induced PNECs to form subcutaneous growths in immune-deficient mice, the tumors did not display the aggressive characteristics of SCLC seen in human patients. Here, we report that the additional, doxycycline-regulated expression of a transgene encoding wild-type or mutant MYC protein promotes rapid growth, invasion, and metastasis of these hESC-derived cells after injection into the renal capsule. Similar to others, we find that the addition of MYC encourages the formation of the SCLC-N subtype, marked by high levels of NEUROD1 RNA. Using paired primary and metastatic samples for RNA-sequencing, we observe that the subtype of SCLC does not change upon metastatic spread and that production of NEUROD1 is maintained. We also describe histological features of these malignant, SCLC-like tumors derived from hESCs and discuss potential uses of this model in efforts to control and better understand this recalcitrant neoplasm.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103999">The dominant-egalitarian transition in species-rich communities</a></h4>

              
                Diverse communities of competing species are generally characterized by substantial niche overlap and strongly stochastic dynamics. Abundance fluctuations are proportional to population size, so the dynamics of rare populations is slower. Hence, once a population becomes rare, its abundance gets stuck at low values. Here, we analyze the effect of this phenomenon on community structure. We identify two distinct phases: a dominance phase, in which a tiny number of species constitute most of the community, and an egalitarian phase, where it takes a finite fraction of all species to constitute most of the community. Using empirical data from microbial, planktonic, and macroorganismal systems, we demonstrate the relevance of this transition and show how demographic stochasticity and immigration critically determine phase behavior. Our results suggest that even slight changes in noise strength or immigration rates can lead to abrupt shifts in community diversity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102823">Increased listening effort and cochlear neural degeneration underlie speech-in-noise deficits in normal-hearing middle-aged adults</a></h4>

              
                Middle age represents a critical period of accelerated brain changes and provides a window for early detection and intervention in age-related neurological decline. Hearing loss is a key early marker of such decline and is linked to numerous comorbidities in older adults. Yet, ~10% of middle-aged individuals who report hearing difficulties show normal audiograms. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could contribute to these hidden hearing deficits, though its role remains unclear due to a lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual outcomes. Here, we employed a cross-species design to examine neural and behavioral signatures of CND. We measured envelope following responses (EFRs) – neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway – in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiograms and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near-identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Behavioral assessments revealed age-related speech-in-noise deficits under challenging conditions, while pupil-indexed listening effort increased with age even when behavioral performance was matched. Together, these results demonstrate that CND contributes to speech perception difficulties and elevated listening effort in midlife, which may ultimately lead to listening fatigue and social withdrawal.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100768">Cellular coordination underpins rapid reversals in gliding filamentous cyanobacteria and its loss results in plectonemes</a></h4>

              
                Cyanobacteria are key contributors to biogeochemical cycles through photosynthesis and carbon fixation. In filamentous, multicellular cyanobacteria, these functions can be influenced through gliding motility, which enables filaments to localise in response to light and also form aggregates. Here, we use the aggregate-forming species <i>Fluctiforma draycotensis</i> to study gliding motility dynamics in detail. We find that filaments move in curved and straight trajectories interspersed with reorientation or reversal of direction. Most reversals take a few seconds, but some take substantially longer, resulting in a long-tailed distribution of stoppage times. Mean filament speeds range around a micron per second with a relatively uniform distribution against filament length, implying that all or a fixed proportion of cells in a filament contribute to movement. We implement a biophysical model that can recapitulate these findings. Model simulations show that for filaments to reverse quickly, cells in a filament must achieve high coordination of the direction of the forces that they generate. To seek experimental support for this prediction, we track individual cells in a filament. This reveals that cells’ translational movement is fully coupled with their rotation along the long axis of the filament, and that cellular movement remains coordinated throughout a reversal. For some filaments, especially longer ones, however, we also find that cellular coordination can be lost, and filaments can form buckles that can twist around themselves, resulting in plectonemes. The experimental findings and the biophysical model presented here will inform future studies of individual and collective filament movement.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98142">A genome-wide association study implicates the olfactory system in Drosophila melanogaster diapause-associated lifespan extension and fecundity</a></h4>

              
                The effects of environmental stress on animal life are gaining importance with climate change. Diapause is a dormancy program that occurs in response to an adverse environment, followed by resumption of development and reproduction upon the return of favorable conditions. Diapause is a complex trait, so we leveraged the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to characterize the genetic basis of diapause. We assessed post-diapause and non-diapause fecundity across 193 DGRP lines. GWAS revealed 546 genetic variants, encompassing single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions associated with post-diapause fecundity. We identified 291 candidate diapause-associated genes, 40 of which had previously been associated with diapause, and 89 of which were associated with more than one SNP. Gene network analysis indicated that the diapause-associated genes were primarily linked to neuronal and reproductive system development. Similarly, comparison with results from other fly GWAS revealed the greatest overlap with olfactory-behavior-associated and fecundity-and-lifespan-associated genes. An RNAi screen of selected candidates identified two neuronal genes, Dip-γ and Scribbler, to be required during recovery for post-diapause fecundity. We complemented the genetic analysis with a test of which neurons are required for successful diapause. We found that although amputation of the antenna had little to no effect on non-diapause lifespan, it reduced diapause lifespan and post-diapause fecundity. We further show that olfactory receptor neurons and temperature-sensing neurons are required for successful recovery from diapause. Our results provide insights into the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of adult reproductive diapause in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98662">Photoreceptor loss does not recruit neutrophils despite strong microglial activation</a></h4>

              
                In response to central nervous system (CNS) injury, tissue-resident immune cells such as microglia and circulating systemic neutrophils are often first responders. The degree to which these cells interact in response to CNS damage is poorly understood, and even less so, in the neural retina, which poses a challenge for high-resolution imaging in vivo. In this study, we deploy fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to study microglia and neutrophils in mice. We simultaneously track immune cell dynamics using label-free phase-contrast AOSLO at micron-level resolution. Retinal lesions were induced with 488 nm light focused onto photoreceptor (PR) outer segments. These lesions focally ablated PRs, with minimal collateral damage to cells above and below the plane of focus. We used in vivo AOSLO, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to reveal the natural history of the microglial and neutrophil response from minutes to months after injury. While microglia showed dynamic and progressive immune response with cells migrating into the injury locus within 1 day after injury, neutrophils were not recruited despite close proximity to vessels carrying neutrophils only microns away. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed in vivo findings. This work illustrates that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal loss of PRs, a condition encountered in many retinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105225">Modular DNA barcoding of nanobodies enables multiplexed in situ protein imaging and high-throughput biomolecule detection</a></h4>

              
                Current immunodetection methods using antibody-DNA conjugates enable multiplexed target detection through orthogonal DNA barcodes, but existing conjugation approaches are labor-intensive and often compromise antibody function. Here, we present a modular, site-specific, and cost-efficient DNA tagging strategy – multiplexed and modular barcoding of antibodies (MaMBA). Utilizing nanobodies as modular adaptors, MaMBA enables direct site-specific labeling of off-the-shelf IgG antibodies with a one-component design. We first applied MaMBA to develop the MaMBA-assisted immunosignal hybridization chain reaction (<i>mis</i>HCR) method for highly multiplexed in situ protein imaging via orthogonal HCR. Its cleavable variant, <i>mis</i>HCR<sup>n</sup>, achieves simultaneous visualization of 12 different targets within the same mouse brain sections through iterative probe use. We further extended the cleavable MaMBA to develop the barcode-linked immunosorbent assay (BLISA) for multiplexed and high-throughput biomolecule detections. By combining BLISA with next-generation sequencing, we successfully measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated antigens in a large number of human serum samples. Additionally, we demonstrated a small-scale drug screen by using BLISA to simultaneously detect eight protein targets. In conclusion, MaMBA offers a highly modular and easily adaptable approach for antibody DNA barcoding, which can be broadly applied in basic research and clinical diagnostics.

                The production of painted, etched, or engraved designs on cave walls or other surfaces is recognized as a major cognitive step in human evolution. Such intentional designs, which are widely interpreted as signifying, recording, and transmitting information in a durable manner, were once considered exclusive to Late Pleistocene <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Here we present observations of what appear to be engraved abstract patterns and shapes within the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system in South Africa, incised into the dolomitic limestone walls of the cave. The markings described here are found on a pillar in the Hill Antechamber that extends into the natural fissure corridor that links the two chambers, and we associate them with <i>Homo naledi</i>. They include deeply impressed lines, cross-hatchings, percussion marks, and other geometric shapes on flat wall surfaces and in and around existing cracks and grooves in the dolomitic limestone walls, found in one specific location of the Dinaledi Subsystem. Remains of multiple <i>H. naledi</i> are found in this part of the cave system, and evidence of mortuary behavior appears in both the Dinaledi Chamber and adjacent Hill Antechamber dated to between 241 and 335 ka (Dirks et al., 2017; Robbins et al., 2021; Berger et al., 2025).

">Distinct Neurogenic Dynamics of Cortico-cortical Neuronal Subtypes in Layer 2/3 of the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the birthdates of excitatory projection neurons are closely linked to their laminar positions, which are often associated with distinct long-range projection targets. Although broad relationships between neurogenic timing, laminar position, and projection patterns are well established, the degree to which birthdate specifies projection identity within the same cortical layer remains unclear. In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are relatively evenly distributed throughout layer 2/3, whereas those projecting to medial areas are biased toward more superficial sublayers. To determine whether these projection identities are linked to neurogenic timing, we combined EdU birthdating with retrograde viral tracing. Notably, we found that V1 layer 2/3 neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are preferentially born at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) compared to E16.5, whereas V1 neurons projecting to medial higher visual areas show no significant birthdate bias between E15.5 and E16.5. These findings suggest that distinct cortico-cortical projection subtypes in layer 2/3 are generated on different temporal schedules, linking neurogenic timing to fine-scale projection identity.

">Different dopaminergic circuits defined by D2/D3 receptor availablity patterns show structure-specific links to memory in ageing</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive ageing is marked by progressive decline in episodic memory and dopaminergic function, yet the extent to which individual differences in dopaminergic system integrity influence memory under motivational contexts remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how baseline D2/D3 receptor availability (BPND0) in key dopaminergic pathways relates to reward-modulated memory performance in healthy older adults. Thirty-three healthy seniors (aged 64-85) underwent two session concurrent MR-PET imaging with [18F]fallypride involving scene categorisation task with high- and low-motivational contexts. We quantified BPND0 across nine dopaminergic regions of interest and examined their relationships with recognition memory performance at short (~15m) and long (~24h) delays. Baseline D2/D3 receptor availability showed high test-retest reliability and regionally distinct profiles, suggesting it reflects a stable neurochemical characteristic in healthy ageing, and principal axis factor analysis revealed two partially independent dopaminergic subsystems (dorsal striatal vs mesolimbic) based on interindividual patterns in receptor densities. Region-specific associations further linked D2/D3 receptor availability to distinct memory outcomes. Higher caudate D2/D3 receptor availability was associated with a liberal response bias (increased hits and false alarms both), whereas higher putamen D2/D3 predicted more durable long-term memory retention. Greater thalamic D2/D3 receptor availability correlated with fewer short-term false memories, while greater D2/D3 receptor availability in the amygdala was associated with better recognition at longer delays. In contrast, higher midbrain (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area) D2/D3 availability which was linked to poorer reward-related memory performance. These findings suggest several complementary dopaminergic circuits supporting episodic memory. Our results highlight dopaminergic neuromodulation as a key factor in cognitive ageing and a potential target for interventions to bolster memory in late life.

">Tongue-Palate Electromyographic Synchronization Related to Swallowing, Mastication, and Speech</a></h4>

              
                The specific oscillatory dynamics of intermuscular coupling involved in swallowing, mastication, speech production, and respiration have not been elucidated. This study aimed to explore intermuscular coupling between the tongue and palate that underlies oral functions by analyzing the event-related coherence (ERC) of electromyography (EMG) signals before swallowing, mastication, and speech production. Twenty-two healthy participants performed three oral tasks: swallowing, speech production, and mastication. Sixteen of these participants also completed a combined task involving swallowing immediately after speech. EMG signals were recorded from the tongue and palate, and ERC between tongue and palate EMG was analyzed. Peak ERC was compared across tasks for alpha (8-14 Hz), beta (16-30 Hz), and gamma (32-46 Hz) frequency bands. In all participants, ERC showed significant peaks in all frequency bands before the onset of swallowing, mastication, and speech. Only the ERC values in the beta band were significantly larger for swallowing than for mastication, but not for speech. Moreover, the ERC values for the combined task of swallowing after speech production were significantly smaller than those for the simple swallowing task in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The intermuscular oscillatory regulation is more critical for swallowing than for mastication.

">The Amplified Burden of Depression in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy: Role of Limbic Network Dynamic Reconfiguration</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: To explore potential associations between drug resistance and limbic network (LN) dynamic functional interactions in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), whether these LN alterations are associated with and potentially mediate comorbid depression severity, and their potential neurochemical and transcriptomic underpinnings. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 49 patients in the Responsive group, 33 patients in the Resistant group, and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Using resting-state fMRI, we derived LN dynamic integration coefficients and used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify coactivation patterns. Depressive symptoms (Self-Rating Depression Scale, SDS), LN integration, and NMF pattern expression were compared across groups (ANOVA) and correlated. Mediation analysis tested if LN integration mediated the relationship between drug resistance status and SDS scores. LN integration differences were spatially correlated with neurotransmitter receptor density and Allen Human Brain Atlas transcriptomic data. Results: Patients in the Resistant group reported significantly higher SDS scores than patients in the Responsive group (p = 0.008). LN integration with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal network (FPN) was significantly lower in the Resistant group compared to the Responsive group (p = 0.001; p < 0.001). NMF analysis identified key LN-DAN (p = 0.013) and LN-FPN (p < 0.001) coactivation patterns. In TLE patients, DAN-LN integration was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.28, p = 0.01), and lower integration levels significantly mediated the relationship between group status (Resistant vs. Responsive) and increased symptom severity (p < 0.001). These LN integration coefficient differences (Responsive group vs. Resistant group) were associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B; r = 0.29, p = 0.036) and dopamine D2 (D2; r = -0.29, p = 0.034) receptor densities, and linked to gene expression pathways including telomerase activity regulation (p < 0.001). Interpretation: This study identifies dynamic LN dysregulation, supported by distinct neurochemical and transcriptomic profiles, as a core bridging mechanism potentially contributing to comorbid depression linked to drug response status in TLE patients.

">Death receptor 6 does not regulate axon degeneration and Schwann cell injury responses during Wallerian degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration (AxD), accompanied by glial remodeling, is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, leading to the disruption of neuronal connectivity [1-3]. Understanding the mechanisms in neurons and glia that regulate AxD is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate axon loss. Wallerian degeneration (WD) is a well-established model to study the mechanisms of nerve injury-induced AxD, glial responses, and axon-glia interactions. We recently showed that Schwann cells (SCs), the axon-associated glia of the peripheral nervous system, exert protective effects on axons through their rapid metabolic injury response [4]. Enhancing this SC response promotes axon protection during WD [4]. A prior study reported that eliminating the orphan tumor necrosis factor receptor DR6 (death receptor 6, Tnfrsf21) strongly delays AxD and alters SC injury responses during WD, suggesting a possible intersection with our findings [5]. Here, we rigorously revisit the role of DR6 in WD using two independent DR6 knockout mouse lines including the same model used in the previous study. Surprisingly, in striking contrast to the earlier report, we observed no impact of DR6 deletion on AxD kinetics or SC injury responses across a range of WD assays. Moreover, injured axons in primary neuronal cultures lacking DR6 degenerated at a similar rate as wild-type axons. We conclude that DR6 is dispensable for the regulation of AxD and glial nerve injury responses during WD. Our data argue that any therapeutic benefit from DR6 suppression in neurodegeneration models occurs through mechanisms independent of WD.

">Procrastination partly reflects an evolutionary byproduct of non-planning impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Procrastination has immediately visible repercussions on health and survival resilience, yet shows stably heritable and remains increasingly pervasive across human societies. Despite a paradox, this behavior is theoretically explained to represent a byproduct of evolutionary advantages underlying impulsivity, yet not deciphered well by scientific evidences. After adjusting psychometric endogeneity, we demonstrate the unique predictive roles of non-planning impulsivity (NPI) during late adolescence and early adulthood uniquely predicts procrastination in later adulthood in a twin cohort (N = 154). This association was further replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 327, N = 1,543). Using AE models, in conjunction of single-paper meta-analytic synthesis (N = 3,656 twin pairs), we observed significant shared genetic contributions underlying this NPI-procrastination association (rg = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.84). Beyond to the phenotypic heritability, employing a Genome-Wide-Association Study (GWAS), six NPI-procrastination overlapping SNPs are identified, functionally accounting for neural dysregulation. Thus, leveraging neurodevelopmental normative modelling (N = 37,407), online meta-analytic estimations (k = 198, loci = 5,855) and seed-based d mapping estimates (N = 893), cortical deviations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) - the brain region showing highest probabilistic overlap mapping NPI to procrastination, partly explains their shared genetic variants, but are substantially independent in genetic contribution. Mendelian Randomization analysis finally indicates causal roles of NPI and procrastination both, to DLPFC deviations. Our findings empirically clarified this theory that procrastination partly derives from NPI as an evolutionary byproduct indeed, but is still unique in neurogenetic entities.

">The effect of psychedelics on associative learning: a systematic review</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Psychedelics are emerging as potential treatments for neuropsychiatric conditions, with evidence suggesting a single administration can lead to enduring behavioural changes. While the underlying putative mechanism(s) remain unclear, there is evidence supporting altered learning as a key candidate. Aim: This systematic review examined studies assessing the effects of psychedelics on associative learning in both humans and animals. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up until 13/01/2025 for studies investigating any difference in learning after psychedelic administration. Results: 31 studies were included (29 in animals, 2 in humans). Classical and operant conditioning paradigms were employed, including fear extinction, conditioned avoidance, and reversal learning. Studies assessed acute and post-acute effects, however repeated dosing paradigms often obscured this distinction. There was considerable heterogeneity in study designs, paradigms, drug administration timings and doses, and behavioural effects appeared to be influenced by dose, timing, training intensity, and sex. Due to between-study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not possible. Evidence suggests that psychedelic administration enhances associative learning in animals across paradigms, although findings were not entirely consistent. Possible mechanisms identified were increased prediction error sensitivity, serotonin receptor agonism, and structural plasticity. Learning enhancements may extend into the post-acute phase and appear to depend on active environmental engagement during this window. Conclusion: Studies suggest that psychedelics enhance associative learning in animals; however, these findings are yet to be translated into humans. Understanding whether a period of enhanced learning follows the psychedelic experience may have important implications for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, where behavioural changes must generalise and persist beyond the drug-induced state.

">Putative long-range mossy fiber sprouting and regional hypermetabolic capacity in the hippocampus of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is pathologically characterized by neuronal loss in the dentate hilus, CA3 and CA1 regions, and mossy fiber (MF) sprouting into the inner molecular layer (iML). The latter forms aberrant excitatory circuities that are considered to facilitate recurrent seizures, with the subiculum also being related to epileptogenic activation. We recently identified a distinct expression of -smooth muscle actin (SMA) at the MF terminals in human hippocampus. This prompted us to explore MF sprouting in resected hippocampi (n=20) from patients with MTLE relative to postmortem control (n=20) using SMA along with reference markers for pathological cross-validation. Compared to control, neuronal loss assessed with neuron-specific nuclear antigen and sortilin immunolabeling reached CA1 in all resected hippocampi. SMA, zinc transporter 3 and -secretase 1 immunolabeling in the iML tended to be increased. The MF-related markers also revealed a preserved fibrous band extending across CA1 to subiculum. Cytochrome c oxidase immunolabeling also increased in iML and subiculum in the MTLE group. Taking together, the current findings point to the existence of long-range MF sprouting and a regional hypermetabolic compacity in the hippocampal formation of patients with drug resistant MTLE.

">Principles of neocortical organisation and behaviour in primates</a></h4>

              
                The development and evolution of neocortical organisation is typically explained by the interaction of two fundamental factors: genetics and experience-dependent processes. Morphogens and signalling molecules would orchestrate the formation of neocortical areas and connection networks, which are later refined through exposure to environmental stimuli. Evolutionary changes to these genetic programs are thought to account for the diversity of brains and behaviours observed in extant species. However, our phylogenetic comparative study of primate neuroanatomy and behaviour shows this view is incomplete. Using brain MRI from 70 primate species we observed that not only the degree of folding but also the folding pattern changes continuously with brain volume, independently of phylogenetic position. To better understand the consequences of this continuity we focused on New and Old World monkeys which diverged approximately 47 million years ago. Large New World monkeys, such as capuchins, have a significantly larger and more folded neocortex than many of their close phylogenetic relatives, whose brains are barely folded. Notably, in addition to folding, their thickness and connectivity patterns were almost identical to those of phylogenetically distant Old World monkeys. Combined analyses of MRI and endocasts from 105 primate species indicated that the highly folded neocortex of large New World monkeys evolved independently from a common ancestor with a small, unfolded brain. Remarkably, across all 70 species, behavioural similarity correlated substantially more with neuroanatomical similarity than with phylogenetic similarity. Our results challenge the prevailing explanation of the development and evolution of neocortical organisation. We propose that the "capuchin anomaly" can be resolved by incorporating mechanical morphogenesis, alongside genetics and experience, as a third fundamental factor. Growth-driven mechanical instabilities would produce similar neuroanatomical organisation patterns and behaviours, emerging independently of the specific genetic determinants of that growth.

">A neuropeptide-specific signaling pathway for state-dependent regulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA)-producing neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) regulate consummatory behavior in a state-dependent manner (e.g. when hungry or thirsty). The mechanisms by which and extent to which DA neurons are regulated by these interoceptive signals are poorly understood. Here, we identify transient receptor potential canonical type 6 (TRPC6) channels as selective mediators of neuropeptide receptor-induced calcium signaling in VTA-DA neurons. These channels regulate DA neuron activity and consummatory behavior in a state-dependent manner. We find that TRPC6 channels regulate distinct aspects of neuropeptide-induced calcium signals in DA neurons but make little contribution to calcium dynamics associated with metabotropic neurotransmitter receptor signaling. We further show that TRPC6 channels regulate scalable reward valuation and consummatory behavior in hungry but not thirsty mice. These findings demonstrate that neuropeptide- and neurotransmitter-activated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate cellular calcium dynamics through distinct mechanisms, and that TRPC6 channels are important determinants of how animals respond to different homeostatic demands.

">A non-invasive test for stria vascularis dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss is common in the human population but it is highly heterogeneous in aetiology which has hampered efforts to develop ways of stopping its progression. Three major sites of the initial dysfunction are the sensory hair cells, their innervation, and the stria vascularis which generates the high potassium endolymph maintained at a high endocochlear potential bathing the apical surface of hair cells. Treatments aimed at the initial site-of-lesion may be useful, and diagnostic tools to distinguish the primary site would help stratify clinical trials and facilitate selection of the most suitable treatment for each person. Here we report a new non-invasive test that distinguishes mutant mice with known stria vascularis dysfunction and reduced endocochlear potential from mice with sensory hair cell or neural defects but with normal endocochlear potential. It is based on measuring inter-trial coherence in auditory brainstem responses to individual stimuli. Mice with reduced strial function show good inter-trial coherence compared with the amplitude of the averaged response, while mice with sensory or neural deficits show poor coherence. This method might be useful in humans to predict whether they have reduced strial function, which cannot be measured directly, and identify who would benefit from treatments aimed at boosting strial function.

">Linking White Matter Integrity to Recognition Memory Speed: Fixel-Based and Fornix Analyses in Young to Middle Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Age-related differences in white matter structure are increasingly understood as nonlinear, regionally specific, and behaviorally relevant. Using whole-brain fixel-based analysis (FBA), we examined how recognition memory speed relates to micro- and macrostructural white matter properties across a sample spanning young to middle adulthood. Slower response times were associated with higher fiber density (FD) in left frontoparietal tracts, nonlinear increases in fiber cross-section (log(FC)) in the anterior corpus callosum, and elevated combined fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in posterior callosal and cingulum pathways. These associations were most pronounced among individuals in the later decades of this age range, suggesting that white matter morphology reflects both extended maturation and emerging age-related decline. In a separate, hypothesis-driven analysis, we applied deterministic tractography to reconstruct the fornix and extracted mean fractional anisotropy (FA) along its length. Greater fornix FA and younger age together explained 34% of the variance in retrieval speed. These findings highlight regionally distinct structural contributions to memory performance and support lifespan models emphasizing individual variability and neuroplasticity in white matter development. This integrative approach underscores the value of combining whole-brain and tract-specific analyses to advance our understanding of white matter contributions to cognitive aging.

">Dynamic task-based reorganization of sensory-biased and supramodal working memory networks in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory working memory is supported by a distributed set of brain regions. Visual working memory and auditory working memory recruit different networks, which include posterior sensory cortices and multiple sensory-biased regions interleaved across frontal cortex. Additionally, a fronto-parietal network of supramodal regions is robustly recruited by working memory in both modalities. Here we examined functional connectivity among visual-biased, auditory-biased, and supramodal working memory networks by collecting fMRI data from 24 human participants (aged 18-43; 11 men and 13 women). Replicating and extending prior work from our laboratory (Tobyne et al., 2017; Noyce et al., 2022), resting-state fMRI (N=18) analysis revealed that the visual-biased WM network exhibits stronger functional connectivity with supramodal regions than does the auditory-biased network. These findings point to a potential functional asymmetry between visual and auditory working memory mechanisms; visual cognition may have more direct access to supramodal WM brain structures. Therefore, we hypothesized that auditory working memory task performance would evoke more robust changes in functional connectivity than would visual working memory task performance. To test this hypothesis, we examined changes in functional connectivity that occur when participants (N=21) perform visual or auditory working memory tasks equated for difficulty. Auditory working memory produced substantial network changes that increased the connectivity of the auditory-biased network to supramodal regions and visual-biased frontal regions. At the same time, connectivity from posterior visual areas to supramodal and frontal visual regions decreased. In contrast, the visual task produced more modest changes in functional connectivity. Moreover, we observed that the strength of auditory-biased network connectivity changes correlated with subject behavioral performance on the auditory task, with higher working memory precision observed in participants with greater connectivity changes. Therefore, the visual working memory network appears to have more robust connectivity to supramodal working memory cortical structures at rest, but during auditory working memory, dynamic network changes permit the auditory working memory network to increase connectivity to the supramodal and frontal visual working memory networks.

">Astrocytes connect specific brain regions through plastic gap junctional networks</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, neuronal axons have been considered the primary mediators of functional connectivity among brain regions. However, the role of astrocyte-mediated communication has been largely underappreciated. While astrocytes communicate with one another through gap junctions, the extent and specificity of this communication remain poorly understood. Astrocyte gap junctions are necessary for memory formation, synaptic plasticity, coordination of neuronal signaling, and closing the visual and motor critical periods. These findings indicate that this form of communication is essential for proper central nervous system development and function. Despite their significance, studying astrocyte gap junctional networks has been challenging. Current methods like slice electrophysiology disrupt network connectivity and introduce artifacts due to tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we developed a vector-based approach that labels molecules as they are fluxed by astrocyte gap junctions in awake, behaving animals. We then used whole-brain tissue clearing to image these intact, three-dimensional astrocyte networks. We show that multiple astrocyte networks traverse the mouse brain. These networks selectively connect specific regions, rather than diffusing indiscriminately, and vary in size and organization. We observe local networks are confined to single brain regions and long-range networks robustly interconnecting multiple regions across hemispheres, often exhibiting patterns distinct from known neuronal networks. Further, we demonstrate that astrocyte networks undergo structural reorganization in adult brain following sensory deprivation. These discoveries reveal a previously unrecognized mode of communication between distant brain regions, mediated by plastic networks of gap junction-coupled astrocytes.

">Astrocyte Store-Released Calcium Modulates Visual Cortex Synapse Development and Circuit Function.</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes, a major class of glial cells, are critical regulators of synapse development during early postnatal life. While dysregulation of this process is implicated in numerous neurological disorders, the precise mechanisms by which astrocytes guide synapse formation and maturation remain poorly understood. A central signaling pathway for astrocytes is the dynamic fluctuation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+), which can arise from various sources and modulate a wide range of downstream effects. A key astrocytic mechanism for integrating neuronal signals is the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores mediated by the IP3 Receptor Type 2 (IP3R2). Although defects in this signaling pathway have been mainly linked to adult brain dysfunction, its role in shaping synaptic development, a period when astrocyte-neuronal communication is established, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of IP3R2-mediated Ca2+ signaling in astrocyte-dependent regulation of synapse development in the mouse visual cortex. Using a combination of histological, molecular, and circuit-level approaches, we found that loss of astrocytic IP3R2 leads to significant deficits in the maturation of glutamatergic but not GABAergic synapses. These synaptic disruptions were accompanied by attenuated visually evoked neuronal activation and impaired behavioral responses to visual threat stimuli. We further show that astrocytic morphological complexity is diminished in the absence of IP3R2, suggesting that store-released Ca2+ is required for both the structural and functional maturation of astrocyte-neuron interactions. Our findings establish a critical role for astrocytic IP3R2-mediated Ca2+ signaling in shaping excitatory circuit development and the emergence of visually driven behaviors.

">Early lineage divergence segregates sensory and non-sensory thalamic circuits</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus integrates sensory, motor, and associative functions via distinct nuclei, yet the developmental principles driving their specification remain unclear. Here, we generate a spatiotemporal single-cell multiomic and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse thalamus, combined with barcoding-based lineage tracing. We identify two major glutamatergic lineages, sensory and motor/associative, each governed by different gene regulatory programs and temporal dynamics. These lineages arise from spatially and molecularly isolated progenitors, revealing an early segregation of functional identities. Within the sensory lineage, we resolve two discrete trajectories leading to first-order visual and somatosensory neurons, both emerging from a shared higher-order default state. Using in silico predictions and in vivo perturbations, we identify Sp9 as a key regulator of visual thalamic fate. Together, our findings define the molecular architecture and developmental trajectories that underpin thalamic modality specification, providing a framework to understand how functional circuits emerge in the mammalian brain.

">Gut stretch evokes rapid neural dynamics in vagal and hindbrain populations of larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Animals sense food quantity and quality to regulate feeding behaviors essential for survival. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the gut epithelium detect luminal distension and nutrients, signaling this information to the brain via vagal sensory neurons. However, how mechanosensory and chemosensory signals are dynamically encoded by gut-brain circuits remains unclear, particularly during early development. Leveraging the transparency and genetic tractability of larval zebrafish, we developed an assay using odorless, alginate-encapsulated particles designed to release nutrients after consumption. Using this approach, we demonstrated that larval EECs regulate nutrient-specific feeding. To determine how these post-ingestive signals are encoded, we developed a microgavage method enabling simultaneous stimulus delivery to the gut and volumetric two-photon calcium imaging. We found that gut distension alone drove widespread activation and suppression in vagal ganglia and dorsal hindbrain, emerging as a dominant enteric signal in early development. Although nutrient-evoked responses shared temporal features with distension, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), an aversive compound found in wasabi, elicited distinct neural dynamics with slow onset. These findings reveal that fast gut-to-brain communication emerges early in life, with distension and aversive cues dynamically and differentially encoded in developing interoceptive circuits.

">Cortical Functional Connectivity in Mouse Models of Early Blindness: Enucleation vs. Anophthalmia</a></h4>

              
                Early sensory deprivation drives large-scale reconfiguration of cortical networks, yet we still lack a clear understanding of the relative contributions of early visual experience versus spontaneous prenatal retinal waves on the establishment of the cortical network. We compared two mouse models of congenital blindness: neonatal enucleation and congenital anophthalmia, across two genetic strains (C57Bl/6J and ZRDBA) using mesoscopic calcium imaging of spontaneous activity and graph-theoretical analysis. Spectral analyses revealed localized strain-specific increases in infraslow and low delta power following visual deprivation, with C57Bl/6J enucleated and ZRDBA anophthalmic mice exhibiting more generalize nodal increase. Concomitantly, network organization was redirected toward medial higher-order visual areas, the associative retrosplenial cortex, and somatosensory regions, while the primary and lateral visual cortices exhibited reduced influence and integration within the modular architecture. Notably, ZRDBA groups showed limited global changes to their cortical network. However, anophthalmic ZRDBA mice, lacking prenatal retinal waves, exhibited connectivity patterns more akin to enucleated C57Bl/6J than to their enucleated littermates, highlighting the instructive role of spontaneous prenatal retinal activity. These findings support a connectivity-constrained, experience-dependent model in which preexisting structural pathways guide diffuse, resilient reorganization following sensory loss.

">Learning the bistable cortical dynamics of the sleep-onset period</a></h4>

              
                Humans just don't fall asleep like a log -- or step-function. Rather, the sleep-onset period (SOP) exhibits dynamic and non-monotonous changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) with high, and so far poorly understood, intra- and inter-individual variability. Computational models of the sleep regulation network have suggested that the transition to sleep can be viewed as a noisy bifurcation at a saddle point which is determined by an underlying control signal or ``sleep drive''. However, such models do not describe how internal control signals in the SOP can produce rapid switches between stable wake and sleep states, nor how these state-space changes are translated in the macroscopic EEG. Here, we propose a minimally-parameterized stochastic dynamical model, in which one slowly-varying control parameter drives the wake-to-sleep transition while exhibiting noise-driven bistability. We provide a procedure for estimating the parameters of the model given single observations of experimental sleep EEG data, and show that it can reproduce a wide variety of SOP phenomenology. Using the model to analyze a pre-existing sleep EEG dataset, we find that the estimated model parameters correlate with subjective sleepiness reports. These results suggest that the bistable characteristics of the SOP can serve as biomarkers for tracking intra- and inter-individual variability of sleep-onset disorders.

                Developments in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field (UHF) now allow for insights into human brain function at mesoscopic scale. However, similar progress has not been achieved for the human spinal cord, despite its importance for reciprocal brain-body communication. Here, we therefore integrate substantial methodological improvements that enable previously unattainable high-resolution UHF spinal fMRI. Using a heat-pain paradigm in healthy volunteers, we investigate fMRI responses in the dorsal horn: we characterize their spatial pattern, establish their robustness and demonstrate that they can be reliably observed even for individual participants. Most importantly, we uncover two physiologically relevant spinal response components - phasic and tonic heat responses - that map differentially onto superficial and deep layers of the dorsal horn. Taken together, our novel UHF fMRI approach allows for differentiating responses across fundamental spinal processing units and will enable insights into human spinal cord function at mesoscopic scale in health and disease.

                Synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by progressive accumulation and spread of misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) throughout the brain. To improve understanding of disease mechanisms we studied the generalizability of aSyn-mediated atrophy. First, we examined wild-type and M83 A53T hemizygous transgenic mice receiving striatal inoculation with human or mouse preformed fibrils (PFFs). Using magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate network-like atrophy and motor deficits, regardless of genotype or PFF species; atrophy was most prominent in M83 mice with mouse PFFs, while human PFFs or wild-type hosts showed attenuated effects. Changing the inoculation site (disease epicentre) to the hippocampus, a major connectivity hub, resulted in localized atrophy. Computational models previously validated in clinical PD predict atrophy patterns associated with striatal but not hippocampal inoculation. Our findings reveal atrophy resulting from aSyn spreading is generalizable across genotype and PFF species, but not disease epicentres, emphasizing the role of regional vulnerability in disease progression.

">Mouse pups lacking a cerebral cortex develop abnormal vocal behavior</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning is an essential component of spoken language and critically depends on the cerebral cortex. The evolutionary origins of cortical/pallial control over vocal learning abilities in mammals and songbirds remains largely unknown. For instance, reports conflict on whether the cerebral cortex contributes, in any way, to vocal communication in vocal non-learning mice. Physiological studies in adult mice have shown that regions of the motor cortex have roles in modulation of vocalizations in mice, yet, genetic ablation of the cerebral cortex reportedly has minimal, if any, impact on mouse vocal behavior. Re-analysis of adult acortical mice revealed that deep learning machine classifiers could distinguish mutant ultrasonic vocalizations from wildtypes. However, the specific acoustic features underlying these differences were not identified. Here, we investigated isolation calls of acortical mouse pups using statistical analysis of acoustic features and playback experiments to determine whether mutants lacking a cerebral cortex have altered vocal development. We find that a subset of acoustic features differ between acortical and wildtype pup vocalizations and that these differences are indicative of distress. Moreover, call bouts of acortical pups have lower informational complexity that are more comparable to random probability sampling. Playbacks indicate that dams preferentially approach vocalizations of acortical pups. Our analyses provide evidence that the murine cerebral cortex influences development of complex vocal behaviors, suggesting mice can be used to gain useful insights into the foundations of vocal learning.

                Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as key regulators of neural circuit development and function, with mounting evidence revealing substantial heterogeneity within and across brain regions. Yet, the full extent of this diversity and its developmental mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we leveraged the uniqueness of the mouse cerebellum, which hosts well-defined astrocyte types and established progenitor pools. Through complementary multi-modal omic approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, trajectory inference, clonal lineage reconstruction, and gene expression and regulatory network analyses, we systematically dissected the molecular diversity and ontogenesis of cerebellar astrocytes. We identified known types and uncovered new subtypes with functional specialization, inferring their developmental trajectories from multiple embryonic niches and postnatal progenitor sources with fate divergence, convergence, and restriction. We further predicted a hierarchical transcriptional regulator code governing this diversification, operating at multiple levels: distinct regulatory modules i) reflect embryonic regionalization and lineage; ii) determine broad astroglial identity; specify iii) Bergmann versus non-Bergmann fates; and guide iv) astrocyte type and v) subtype acquisition. Our findings map and temporally organize transcriptional programs that capture key determinants of astrocyte fate, integrating them along defined trajectories toward diverse astrocyte identities. This high-resolution framework for cerebellar glial diversification offers a model to be challenged across other brain regions.

">Functional Connectome of Superagers Reveals Early Markers of Resilience and Vulnerability to Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                As populations age, identifying the neurobiological basis of cognitive resilience is critical for delaying or preventing Alzheimers disease (AD). While most older adults experience memory decline, a subset known as superagers (SA) maintains youthful memory into late life, offering a unique window into protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration. Here, we identified a functional connectivity (FC) signature, termed Alzheimer's-resilient connectome (ARC), that robustly differentiates SA from age-matched patients with AD. Using resting-state fMRI in a discovery cohort (N = 290), we identified ARC derived from machine learning classifiers that distinguished SA from AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.85), and validated the replicability of the ARC in an independent replication cohort (N = 143). ARC involved prefrontal, temporal and insular networks and was strongly associated with brain age. When applied to cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults (discovery cohort: N = 818 and replication cohort: N = 497), ARC-based subtyping revealed SA-like and AD-like subgroups with similar baseline cognitive performance but markedly divergent longitudinal trajectories. SA-like CU individuals showed slower cognitive decline, reduced amyloid-{beta} accumulation, and lower risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment and AD, reinforcing the ARC signature as a potential early indicator of resilience. Genome-wide association analysis identified CLYBL and FRMD6 as novel genetic modulators associated with these divergent aging phenotypes. Together, our findings position ARC as a sensitive and generalizable biomarker of resilience, enabling early risk stratification and precision prevention for AD.

">Lexical brain responses in 10-year-old children are impaired in dyslexia: an FPVS-EEG study</a></h4>

              
                The developmental origin of the left occipitotemporal cortex specialization for automatic lexical access from vision remains unclear. Here we investigated cortical specialization for print processing in children with or without dyslexia, focusing on two distinct tuning levels: coarse-grained tuning for letter/symbol discrimination, and fine-grained tuning for word/pseudoword discrimination. 10-year-old typical readers (n=24) and children with dyslexia (n=14) were tested with electroencephalography (EEG) and fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS), viewing streams of stimuli at a relatively fast rate (6Hz) for 40 seconds with deviant categories every 5 items (at 6Hz/5=1.2Hz). Deviant words or pseudowords among pseudo-font strings elicited clear coarse ocicpito-temporal discrimination responses significantly larger over the left than the right hemisphere (LH), numerically larger in typical readers. Unlike in adults, these responses were unaffected by lexicality. Deviant regular or irregular words among matched pseudowords generated a finer-grained word-selective response only over the LH. While irregular words elicited similar brain responses in both groups, regular words were not discriminated from pseudowords in children with dyslexia. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of FPVS-EEG to implicitly detect lexical neural responses in 10 years old children within a few minutes, as well as atypical lexical processing in children with dyslexia.

">Words Matter with Age: Instructions Dictate Self-Selected Walking Speed in Young and Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Background: Our previous work demonstrated that in young adults, 61% of gait speed variance was attributable to instruction type. However, no study has investigated whether verbal instructions differentially influence older adults. Research question: This study investigated how walking prompts contribute to gait speed variability across age groups. Methods: Thirty-four young adults (21+- 2 years) and twenty-eight older adults (70+- 5 years) performed walking trials responding to 24 different instructions. Results: Average walking speed was 1.23+-0.30 m/s. Between-subject variance accounted for 25.3% of the total variance, while between subject and instruction variance components accounted for 76.1% of the total variance. When analyzed separately, variance due to instructions accounted for similar amounts of total variance within older adults (56.9%) and young adults (55.7%), a statistically non-significant difference (p = 0.85). A significant age-instruction interaction (X^2=84.13, df = 23. p<0.001) revealed that the age differences between average gait speed depended on which instruction was given. Complex instructions elicited the largest between group differences (B:-0.26 to -0.34 m/s), while simple tasks showed minimal differences (B:-0.05 to -0.07 m/s). Significance: Instructions explain similar variance within each age group (~56%), but the model treating instructions as fixed effects captures how different age groups respond to the same instructions. These findings highlight that gait assessment protocols should consider age-specific responses to verbal cues, as instructions that produce minimal between-group differences may be most appropriate for standardized clinical assessments across the lifespan.

                <p>It has long been hypothesized that the nervous system uses the direction of gravity to align the various sensory systems when interacting with the external world. In line with this hypothesis, systematic drift in hand-path orientation was recently observed during targeted arm motions performed with eyes closed in weightlessness or, on Earth, for longitudinal movements in a supine posture. No such drift was observed in upright posture on Earth. But the precise conditions under which participants exhibit such drift, and the factors that influence the magnitude of the drift, are not yet known. The objective of our study was to investigate if the upright posture, by virtue of being at a biomechanical singularity induced by the force of gravity, represents a unique condition in which drift in hand-path orientation is prevented. Human participants (male and female) performed sequences of repeated point-to-point arm movements between two visual targets aligned with the longitudinal body axis, first with eyes open, then with eyes closed. Participants performed these movements in various body orientations: seated upright, and tilted backward at 45, 90, and 135&deg;. We observed drift in hand-path orientation in the eyes-closed condition when the body was tilted, but not when it was upright. The directions and rates of drift were indistinguishable between the three tilted orientations tested (45, 90, and 135&deg;). These findings support the hypothesis that the upright posture is a unique configuration that facilitates sensorimotor transformations and prevents drift in path orientation when the eyes are closed.</p>

                <p>The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), involved in horizontal gaze control, contributes to this function via cooperation with the vestibulocerebellum (VC). Furthermore, some PHN neurons have been observed to project to cerebellar regions outside the VC. We previously reported a neuronal population in the ventral caudal PHN that projects to lobules III&ndash;V of the anterior vermis or to the cerebellar hemispheric crus. Because the properties of these neurons have not been clarified, this study aimed to determine their localization, projections, and electrophysiological and morphological characteristics in male rats. Tracing experiments revealed that these neurons were clustered within the ventral caudal PHN, approximately between the bregma &ndash;12.72 and &ndash;12.00&nbsp;mm, and did not project to the uvula/nodulus (UN), which is part of the VC. Whole-cell recordings and morphological experiments revealed that these PHN neurons exhibited high input capacitance, low input resistance, low-frequency firing, prominent voltage sag, and a multipolar shape. These results indicate that a cluster of neurons in the ventral caudal PHN projecting to lobules III&ndash;V of the anterior vermis and hemispheric crus share distinct electrophysiological and morphological properties. Furthermore, these PHN neurons are likely to constitute a distinct subpopulation from PHN neurons projecting to the VC in terms of their projection targets. While previous research has focused on PHN projections to the VC and their role in ocular motor control, this study suggests that this subpopulation may be involved in other motor functions, as the cerebellar anterior vermis and hemisphere are known to contribute to broader motor control.</p>

Identifying risk genes associated with complex traits remains challenging. Integrating gene expression data with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) through Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods has discovered candidate risk genes for various complex traits. Splicing, which explains a comparable heritability of complex traits as gene expression, is underexplored due to its multidimensionality. To leverage multiple splicing events in a gene and shared splicing across tissues, we develop Multi-tissue Splicing Gene (MTSG), which employs tensor decomposition and sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (sCCA) to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional multiple splicing events across multiple tissues. We build MTSG models using GTEx data and apply them to GWAS summary statistics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) and schizophrenia (SCZ) (36,989 cases and 113,075 controls). We identify 174 and 497 significant splicing-mediated risk genes for AD and SCZ, respectively, at Bonferroni correction. For AD, our results demonstrate significant enrichment of AD related pathways and identify additional AD risk genes not detected in the single-tissue analysis, while preserving most top genes identified in the brain frontal cortex. Consistently, for SCZ, genes identified by our brain-wide MTSG model, built from a cluster of 13 brain tissues, exhibit stronger enrichment in SCZ-relevant genes and MTSG identifies unique SCZ risk genes compared to single-tissue models. These results showcase that our MTSG models capture distinctive splicing events across tissues, which might be overlooked when using single tissue alone. Our MTSG models can be applied to other complex traits to help identify splicing-mediated disease risk genes.

For unicellular organisms, the reproduction rate and growth are crucial fitness determinants and functional manifestations of the organism genotype. Using the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a model organism, we integrated metabolism, which provides energy and building blocks for growth, with cell mass growth and cell cycle progression into a low-granularity, multiscale (from cell to population) computational model. This model predicted that cells with constitutive respiration do not modulate cell size according to the growth conditions. We experimentally validated the model predictions using mutants with defects in the upper part of glycolysis or glucose transport. Plugging in molecular details of cellular subsystems allowed us to refine predictions from the cellular to the molecular level. Our hybrid multiscale modeling approach provides a framework for structuring molecular knowledge and predicting cell phenotypes under various genetic and environmental conditions.

                <p>by Lars Erik J. Skjegstad, Julius B. Kirkegaard</p>

The vascular network of leaves, comprising xylem and phloem, is a highly optimized system for the delivery of water, nutrients, and sugars. The design rules for these naturally occurring networks have been studied since the time of Leonardo da Vinci, who constructed a local rule for comparing the widths of in- and outgoing veins at branch points. Recently, physical models have been developed that seek to explain the full morphogenesis of leaf venial networks in which veins grow in response to local hydrodynamic feedback. Although these models go beyond simple local rules, they are challenging to compare to experimental data. Here, we extend these hydrodynamic models to a state where the direct comparison with images of full leaves becomes possible on the level of individual veins. We present a dataset of the venial networks of leaves that maintain full network topology and use this to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a direct comparison. We apply our approach to the direct estimation of a sink fluctuation parameter, demonstrating consistency within distinct leaf species. Finally, we utilize the ability of the model to run on full leaves to define and calculate exponents for a Murray’s law that applies to reticulate venation networks.

                <p>by Nobubelo K. Ngandu, Burtram C. Fielding, Peter van Heusden, Kuhle Mcinga, Kriheska Francis, Gordon Harkins</p>

There is currently limited understanding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) adaptation to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins which mediate CD8 (HLA-I) and CD4 (HLA-II) T cell immune responses. We investigated population-level T cell immune escape in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at amino acid binding positions (the anchor motifs) preferred by the highly restrictive peptide binding grooves of the HLA. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences isolated in South Africa from January 2020 until June 2022, were used. All possible 9-mer and 15-mer peptides in the sequence alignment were scanned for matches to HLA-I and HLA-II anchor motifs, respectively. Peptide positions with matched anchor motifs and ≥1% mismatched sequences were investigated for immune escape using immunoinformatic prediction methods and directional evolution along the phylogenetic tree. Toggling of short-lived immune escape mutations at HLA-I anchor motifs was observed in 17 peptides across Spike. Eight of these overlapped with HLA-II escape mutations. Six mutations were related to zoonotic adaptation. All 17 sites were under significant directional evolution along the phylogenetic tree, and 16/17 are within published confirmed or inferred T cell epitopes. Immune escape predictions for HLA- A*66:01/A*68:01 were common (n = 7/17). HLA- A*02:05, A*03:01, B*07:02, B*08:01, B*58:01, DRB1*04:01 and DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 were each associated with at least two escape mutations. This immunoinformatic prediction of T cell immune escape at HLA anchor motifs: (i)shortlisted potentially understudied population-specific HLA and immune escape (ii)revealed a footprint of underlying toggling of short-lived immune escape mutations, and (iii)has potential to cost-effectively guide pre-clinical research questions on the inclusion of partially conserved but dominant epitopes in vaccine immunogens.

                <p>by Thomas Robert Newton, Wilten Nicola</p>

Training spiking recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) presents significant challenges compared to standard recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that model neural firing rates more directly. Here, we investigate the origins of these difficulties by training networks of spiking neurons and their parameter-matched instantaneous rate-based RNNs on supervised learning tasks. We applied FORCE training to leaky integrate-and-fire spiking networks and their matched rate-based counterparts across various dynamical tasks, keeping the FORCE hyperparameters identical. We found that at slow learning rates, spiking and rate networks behaved similarly: FORCE training identified highly correlated weight matrix solutions, and both network types exhibited overlapping hyperparameter regions for successful convergence. Remarkably, these weight solutions were largely interchangeable—weights trained in the spiking network could be transferred to the rate network and vice versa while preserving correct dynamical decoding. However, at fast learning rates, the correlation between learned solutions dropped sharply, and the solutions were no longer fully interchangeable. Despite this, rate networks still functioned well when their weight matrices were replaced with those learned from spiking networks. Additionally, the two network types exhibited distinct behaviours across different sizes: faster learning improved performance in rate networks but had little effect in spiking networks, aside from increasing instability. Through analytic derivation, we further show that slower learning rates in FORCE effectively act as a low-pass filter on the principal components of the neural bases, selectively stabilizing the dominant correlated components across spiking and rate networks. Our results indicate that some of the difficulties in training spiking networks stem from the inherent spike-time variability in spiking systems—variability that is not present in rate networks. These challenges can be mitigated in FORCE training by selecting appropriately slow learning rates. Moreover, our findings suggest that the decoding solutions learned by FORCE for spiking networks approximate a cross-trial firing rate-based decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012539">Analyzing greedy vaccine allocation algorithms for metapopulation disease models</a></h4>

As observed in the case of COVID-19, effective vaccines for an emerging pandemic tend to be in limited supply initially and must be allocated strategically. The allocation of vaccines can be modeled as a discrete optimization problem that prior research has shown to be computationally difficult (i.e., NP-hard) to solve even approximately. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental results, we show that this hardness result may be circumvented. We present our results in the context of a metapopulation model, which views a population as composed of geographically dispersed heterogeneous subpopulations, with arbitrary travel patterns between them. In this setting, vaccine bundles are allocated at a subpopulation level, and so the vaccine allocation problem can be formulated as a problem of maximizing an integer lattice function g:ℤ+K→ℝ subject to a budget constraint ‖x‖1≤D. We consider a variety of simple, well-known greedy algorithms for this problem and show the effectiveness of these algorithms for three problem instances at different scales: New Hampshire (10 counties, population 1.4 million), Iowa (99 counties, population 3.2 million), and Texas (254 counties, population 30.03 million). We provide a theoretical explanation for this effectiveness by showing that the approximation factor (a measure of how well the algorithmic output for a problem instance compares to its theoretical optimum) of these algorithms depends on the <i>submodularity ratio</i> of the objective function <i>g</i>. The submodularity ratio of a function is a measure of how distant <i>g</i> is from being submodular; here submodularity refers to the very useful “diminishing returns” property of set and lattice functions, i.e., the property that as the function inputs are increased the function value increases, but not by as much.

                <p>by Kendrick Kay, Jacob S. Prince, Thomas Gebhart, Greta Tuckute, Jingyang Zhou, Thomas Naselaris, Heiko H. Schütt</p>

Measurements of neural responses to identically repeated experimental events often exhibit large amounts of variability. This <i>noise</i> is distinct from <i>signal</i>, operationally defined as the average expected response across repeated trials for each given event. Accurately distinguishing signal from noise is important, as each is a target that is worthy of study (many believe noise reflects important aspects of brain function) and it is important not to confuse one for the other. Here, we describe a principled modeling approach in which response measurements are explicitly modeled as the sum of samples from multivariate signal and noise distributions. In our proposed method—termed Generative Modeling of Signal and Noise (GSN)—the signal distribution is estimated by subtracting the estimated noise distribution from the estimated data distribution. Importantly, GSN improves estimates of the signal distribution, but does not provide improved estimates of responses to individual events. We validate GSN using ground-truth simulations and show that it compares favorably with related methods. We also demonstrate the application of GSN to empirical fMRI data to illustrate a simple consequence of GSN: by disentangling signal and noise components in neural responses, GSN denoises principal components analysis and improves estimates of dimensionality. We end by discussing other situations that may benefit from GSN’s characterization of signal and noise, such as estimation of noise ceilings for computational models of neural activity. A code toolbox for GSN is provided with both MATLAB and Python implementations.

The biogenesis of mitochondria relies on the import of hundreds of different precursor proteins from the cytosol. Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ with respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34, and the structurally related yeast co-chaperone Cns1, apparently serve as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.

                <p>by Pavanjit Chaggar, Jacob Vogel, Alexa Pichet Binette, Travis B. Thompson, Olof Strandberg, Niklas Mattsson-Carlgren, Linda Karlsson, Erik Stomrud, Saad Jbabdi, Stefano Magon, Gregory Klein, with the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative , Oskar Hansson, Alain Goriely</p>
Aggregation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a central driver of Alzheimer’s disease, and its accumulation exhibits a rich spatiotemporal pattern that unfolds during the course of the disease, sequentially progressing through the brain across axonal connections. It is unclear how this spatiotemporal process is orchestrated, namely, to what extent the spread of pathologic tau is governed by transport between brain regions, local production, or both. To address this, we develop a mechanistic model from tau PET data to describe tau dynamics along the Alzheimer’s disease timeline. Our analysis reveals longitudinal changes in production and transport dynamics in two independent cohorts, with subjects in the early stage of the disease exhibiting transport-dominated spread, consistent with an initial spread of pathological tau seeds, and subjects in the late stage disease characterized primarily by local tau production. Further, we demonstrate that the model can predict accurately subject-specific longitudinal tau accumulation at the regional level, potentially providing a new clinical tool to monitor and classify patient disease progression.

<p>We examined effective brain connectivity in children with and without developmental dyscalculia (DD) during number order and identification tasks.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Numerical-order ability, a strong predictor of arithmetic, is often impaired in children with developmental dyscalculia (DD). While previous research has shown altered brain responses in number-processing regions in DD compared to typically developing children (TD), little is known about how these regions interact during number processing. This exploratory study examined the effective connectivity between six regions in the right parietal, frontal, and insular cortex as well as the vermis, using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). We investigated how number-order and number-identification tasks modulate connectivity within this network and the group differences related to DD. The number-order task led primarily to increased excitatory connectivity from the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) to all other regions, indicating an orchestrating role of the preSMA. DD, who exhibited deficits in number-order performance, demonstrated aberrant modulation of incoming connectivity to the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) from the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), the preSMA, and the dorsal anterior insula (d-aINS). In TD, number-identification led to inhibitory modulation from the vPMC to the aIPS and the vermis. While behavioral performance in number-identification was unimpaired in DD, they showed increased excitatory connectivity from dorsal and ventral PMC to the d-aINS and from vPMC to the aIPS. Our results imply that, for both impaired and unimpaired number-related behavioral performance, neuronal number processing differs between DD and TD. This conclusion is further supported by the high predictive validity of the modulating connectivity group-effect parameters. We suggest the underlying explanation for this pattern may be related to decreased acuity of neuronal number representation in DD.</p>

<p>The advances achieved against multiple sclerosis (MS) represent one of the great success stories of modern molecular medicine. The development of therapies with increasing selectivity and safety, guided by gains in understanding the fundamental immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and triggers of this disease, have broadened the traditional focus on treatment, adding realistic possibilities for prevention and repair. Here, we summarize recent advances that have together transformed the disease from the most common crippler of young adults in the western world to its place today as a condition in which most newly diagnosed patients can anticipate lives free from disability.

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, yet it often remains opaque to clinicians, scientists, and patients alike. This review, part 1 of a 3-part series, provides neurologists and neuroscientists with a foundational understanding of AI's key concepts, terminology, and applications. We begin by tracing AI's origins in mathematics, human logic, and brain-inspired neural networks to establish a context for its development. The review highlights AI's growing role in neurological diagnostics and treatment, emphasizing machine learning applications, such as computer vision, brain-machine interfaces, and precision care. By mapping the evolution of AI tools and linking them to neuroscience and human reasoning, we illustrate how AI is reshaping neurological practice and research. We end the review with an overview of model selection in AI and a case scenario illustrating how AI may drive precision neurological care. Part 1 sets the stage for part 2, which will focus on practical applications of AI in real-world scenarios where humans and AI collaborate as joint cognitive systems. Part 3 will examine AI's integration with extensive healthcare and neurology networks, innovative clinical trials, and massive datasets, expanding our vision of AI's global impact on neurology, healthcare systems, and society.

                <p>Neuropsychiatric diseases are common among forcibly displaced persons, and a better understanding is needed to improve screening and treatment efforts. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study at a single academic center looking at neuropsychiatric diagnoses of United States resettled refugees presenting for their domestic medical examination. Over one-third (33%) of our study population had at least one neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Although globally and in the United States, leading causes of neurological disease are stroke, dementia, and migraines, in our clinic the predominant etiologies were headache disorders, peripheral nerve disorders, and traumatic brain injury, highlighting a need for broadening screening at this initial visit.

     alt="Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts"/>
<p>Higher amyloid positivity rate and amyloid load in patients with a clinical diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Longitudinal early-onset Alzheimer's disease study [LEADS], n = 399) than late-onset AD (Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative [ADNI], n = 450).
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, <i>APOE</i> genotype, and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74–82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67–75, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with <i>lower</i> CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:236–248</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to analyze the progression of cerebral edema post-endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large infarcts and its association with functional outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A secondary analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Acute Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusive Patients with a Large Infarct Core trial was conducted in patients with large ischemic cores randomized to receive either EVT or medical management (MM) alone. Patients who had follow-up imaging within 7 days post-randomization were involved. The primary outcome was midline shift (MLS). Mediation analysis was performed with EVT as the independent variable, MLS as the mediator, and modified Rankin scale scores at 90 days served as the endpoint. An exploratory analysis was conducted on the progression of net water uptake (ΔNWU).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 434 patients, median age was 66.0 years (standard deviation [SD], 9.9), with 61.3% (266) being males. EVT was associated with an early increase in MLS at 24 (±12) hours after randomization (mean [SD], 3.0 [4.2] vs 2.4 [3.6]mm; <i>p</i> = 0.03) compared with the MM group, partially mediating poorer functional outcomes post-EVT (mediation proportion, −25%; 95% CI, −46.54 to −4.10), but did not negate the overall efficacy of thrombectomy. The progression of NWU remained slower after EVT throughout 7 days, inconsistent with MLS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with large infarct cores, EVT was associated with an early increased mass effect compared with MM, potentially mediating poorer functional outcomes. Despite the evident overall benefits from thrombectomy, accurate prediction and effective anti-edema interventions for the early mass effect post-EVT may further improve outcomes. The complex relationship between NWU and cerebral edema progression warrants further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:258–269</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to quantify differences in the brain and spinal cord between Friedreich ataxia and controls, stratified by age and disease stage, including for the first time in young children.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TRACK-FA is the largest prospective, longitudinal, multi-modal neuroimaging study in Friedreich ataxia to date. We assessed individuals with Friedreich ataxia and controls, 5 to 42 years, at 7 sites across 4 continents. The 17 imaging primary outcome measures (POMs) were selected from metrics that showed a significant longitudinal change in previous small-scale studies. These included brain and spinal cord morphometry (structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and microstructure (diffusion MRI); brain iron levels (quantitative susceptibility mapping); and spinal cord biochemistry (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). This study is registered with <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> (NCT04349514).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between February 2021 and August 2023, we assessed 169 individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 95 controls. Compared to controls, individuals with Friedreich ataxia had lower volume of dentate nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncles; smaller cross-sectional area of spinal cord; lower fractional anisotropy and higher diffusivity in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles; and lower total N-acetyl-aspartate/myo-inositol ratio in spinal cord. Morphometric differences in spinal cord and superior cerebellar peduncles increased dramatically with age during childhood, with rapid development in controls, but not in Friedreich ataxia. Many imaging POMs showed significant associations with clinical severity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27240?af=R">Association Between Vascular NOTCH3 Aggregation and Disease Severity in a CADASIL Cohort – Implications for NOTCH3 Variant‐Specific Disease Prediction</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vascular NOTCH3 protein ectodomain aggregation is a pathological hallmark of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a monogenic small vessel disease typically caused by cysteine-altering variants in <i>NOTCH3</i>. Given their high population frequency, these <i>NOTCH3</i> variants are an important genetic contributor to stroke and vascular dementia worldwide. Disease severity in CADASIL is highly variable and is mainly determined by the position of the pathogenic <i>NOTCH3</i> variant in the NOTCH3 ectodomain. Here, we aimed to investigate the association between NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels, cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and disease severity in a prospective cohort study of 212 patients with CADASIL with 39 distinct cysteine-altering <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NOTCH3 aggregation load in skin vessels was determined by calculating the NOTCH3 score; the fraction of skin vessel wall area positive for NOTCH3 staining. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores were calculated for variants present in 10 or more participants, by averaging the NOTCH3 scores of individuals with that distinct variant. The associations between the NOTCH3 score, <i>NOTCH3</i> variants, and neuroimaging and clinical outcomes were investigated using multivariable linear mixed models, Cox regression, and mediation analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The NOTCH3 score was significantly associated with lifetime stroke probability and small vessel disease neuroimaging outcomes, but not with age. Variant-specific NOTCH3 scores reflected differences in disease severity associated with distinct <i>NOTCH3</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that differences in NOTCH3 aggregation propensity underlie the differences in disease severity associated with <i>NOTCH3</i> cysteine-altering variants, and show that <i>NOTCH3</i>-variant specific NOTCH3 scores can contribute to improved individualized disease prediction in CADASIL.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite substantial advancements in uncovering the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a significant portion of cases characterized by familial PD remain genetically elusive. Here, we reported that biallelic variants in <i>EPG5</i>, a key autophagy gene responsible for Vici syndrome, are associated with PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the first cohort including 171 pedigrees with autosomal recessive PD (ARPD), 1,746 cases of sporadic early-onset PD (sEOPD, age at onset ≤ 50 years) and 1,652 healthy controls. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in the second cohort consisting of 1,947 sporadic late-onset PD (sLOPD, age at onset &gt;50 years) and 2,478 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 7 participants harboring compound heterozygous variants within the <i>EPG5</i> gene across 1 family with ARPD (ARPD-F1), 4 sporadic EOPD cases, and 1 sporadic LOPD individual. A total of 10 novel variants in <i>EPG5</i> were discovered in the 7 individuals, comprising 3 nonsense variants and 7 missense variants. The compound heterozygous variants in the <i>EPG5</i> gene led to decreased expression of EPG5 protein, and impaired autophagy-lysosome function in cells derived from <i>EPG5</i>-PD individuals. We also revealed several key pathological features, including abnormal accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, aggregation of α-synuclein in skin tissue from <i>EPG5</i>-PD individuals. In mice, EPG5 deficiency led to progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra of the midbrain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results unveil a novel association between biallelic variants in <i>EPG5</i> gene and PD, providing compelling initial evidence for the involvement of <i>EPG5</i> and autophagy dysregulation in the development of PD. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:369–385</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare clinical and radiological outcomes among relapsing multiple sclerosis patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), alemtuzumab (ATZ), and ocrelizumab (OCR).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a London (UK) hospital-based observational cohort, modeled data were obtained from 621 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients, who were treated with AHSCT (n = 103), ATZ (n = 204), and OCR (n = 314), and were followed up for 43, 43, and 32 median months, respectively. The annualized relapse rate, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and disability progression on Expanded Disability Status Scale were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AHSCT showed superior efficacy compared with ATZ and OCR. After 5-year follow up, the mean annualized relapse rate (0.026 vs 0.087; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the risk of relapses (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and of MRI activity (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.006) were significantly lower in AHSCT versus ATZ group. Compared with OCR, after 3-year follow-up AHSCT showed a significantly lower annualized relapse rate (0.028 vs 0.073; <i>p</i> = 0.02) and a trend to reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18–1.14; <i>p</i> = 0.09), but similar low rates (6%) of new MRI activity (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28–2.67; <i>p</i> = 0.80). In addition, there was a similar risk of Expanded Disability Status Scale progression in AHSCT, and both ATZ (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71–2.00; <i>p</i> = 0.50) and OCR (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57–2.04; <i>p</i> = 0.82) groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AHSCT was followed by greater prevention of relapses compared with ATZ and OCR, and suppressed more profoundly MRI activity than ATZ, but similarly to OCR, albeit with shorter follow up. The risk of accumulating disability was similar among the treated groups. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up may enable confirmation of these findings or detection of any additional differential effects. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:294–307</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27248?af=R">Cholinergic Degeneration and Cognitive Function in Early GBA1‐Related Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The phenotype of patients with Parkinson's disease carrying <i>GBA</i>1 variants (GBA-PD) suggest similarities to symptomatology associated with early cholinergic system degeneration. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the clinical features and the cholinergic innervation pattern in patients with early GBA-PD versus those without the <i>GBA1</i> mutation (non-GBA-PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 46 GBA-PD and 104 non-GBA-PD subjects were included. Clinical assessments included motor and non-motor evaluation, as well as a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Cholinergic system integrity was assessed using <sup>1</sup>
<sup>8</sup>F-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (<sup>18</sup>F-FEOBV) positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the differences between GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD. Given the higher prevalence of females in GBA-PD, analyses were repeated when stratified by sex. Additionally, we examined the association between cognitive domains and whole-brain cholinergic binding in both groups. Exploratory analyses examined clinical and <sup>18</sup>F-FEOBV binding differences among <i>GBA1</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GBA-PD patients exhibited a higher burden of non-motor symptoms and lower cognitive performance on executive functions and attention. We observed a more pronounced cholinergic denervation in GBA-PD, compared to non-GBA-PD, primarily in the anterior, central, and limbic regions. However, the distribution of cholinergic loss and its association with attention and executive dysfunction was comparable between GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD. In addition, the clinical presentation and cholinergic binding differed significantly between sexes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest an important role of early cholinergic denervation in GBA-PD patients, which is related to more severe cognitive dysfunction. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:398–409</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging is routinely utilized to identify new inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). A large language model to classify narrative magnetic resonance imaging reports in the electronic health record (EHR) as discrete data could provide significant benefits for MS research. The objectives of the current study were to develop such a prompt and to illustrate its research applications through a common clinical scenario: monitoring response to B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An institutional ecosystem that securely connects healthcare data with ChatGPT4 was applied to clinical MS magnetic resonance imaging reports in a single institutional EHR (2000–2022). A prompt (msLesionprompt) was developed and iteratively refined to classify the presence or absence of new T2-weighted lesions (newT2w) and contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL). The multistep validation included evaluating efficiency (time and cost), comparison with manually annotated reports using standard confusion matrix, and application to identifying predictors of newT2w/CEL after BCDT start.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Accuracy of msLesionprompt was high for detection of newT2w (97%) and CEL (96.8%). All 14,888 available reports were categorized in 4.13 hours ($28); 79% showed no newT2w or CEL. Data extracted showed expected suppression of new activity by BCDT (&gt;97% monitoring magnetic resonance images after an initial “rebaseline” scan). Neighborhood poverty (Area Deprivation Index) was identified as a predictor of inflammatory activity (newT2w: OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.10–2.59, <i>p</i> = 0.017; CEL: OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01–2.34, <i>p</i> = 0.046).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Extracting discrete information from narrative imaging reports using an large language model is feasible and efficient. This approach could augment many real-world analyses of MS disease evolution and treatment response. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:308–316</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of several muscle damage biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (PARALS) were considered for this study. Survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to death, tracheostomy, or the censoring date. Blood levels of potassium, creatinine, creatine kinase, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) diagnosis were evaluated as potential prognostic biomarkers. A Cox model was developed for each biomarker and adjusted for sex, onset age, onset site, and diagnostic delay. Significant findings from PARALS were evaluated in the Pooled Resource Open-Access Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. Additionally, a joint model was constructed to evaluate the prognostic role of phosphatemia slope over time using longitudinal data from PRO-ACT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,444 and 1,023 patients were included in the PARALS and PRO-ACT cohorts, respectively. Only creatinine (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–0.85) and phosphorus (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04–1.24) showed a significant association with survival in the PARALS cohort. These findings were further validated in the PRO-ACT cohort (creatinine HR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.13–0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; phosphorus HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.13–4.88, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Longitudinal data from the PRO-ACT database showed that an increase of 0.1 mmol/l per month in phosphate levels was also associated with a HR of 8.26 (95% CI = 1.07–96.6, <i>p</i> = 0.044).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatininemia was confirmed as a prognostic marker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, both phosphatemia levels at diagnosis and its rate of change over time were identified as a potential prognostic marker for ALS. As with other blood biomarkers, phosphate levels are cost-effective and minimally invasive to measure, supporting their potential use in clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are limited population-based data regarding the prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and associated risks of mortality and incident cerebrovascular events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient claims from 2008 to 2022 from a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. CAA and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. We ascertained CAA from October 1, 2015 through 2022, and used data from 2008 through September 30, 2015 to ascertain comorbidities including prevalent stroke. We used Cox regression to examine the association of CAA with subsequent death and incident stroke subtypes after adjustment for demographics, vascular risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,920,312 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample, 2,161 (11.3 per 10,000) had a diagnosis of CAA. In adjusted Cox regression analysis, there was an association between CAA and subsequent mortality (HR 4.9; 95% CI 4.6–5.2). Among 1,872,474 patients without prevalent stroke, including 900 of the CAA patients, there was a significant association between CAA and an increased risk of any stroke (HR 8.0; 95% CI 6.7–9.6), ischemic stroke (HR 4.6; 95% CI 3.6–6.0), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR 26.9; 95% CI 20.3–35.6), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR 21.6; 95% CI 12.2–38.1). After a diagnosis of CAA, absolute risks of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were broadly similar.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a large, nationwide cohort of Medicare beneficiaries, the prevalence of clinically diagnosed CAA was approximately 11 per 10,000. CAA was associated with an increased risk of mortality and incident stroke, both hemorrhagic and ischemic. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:249–257</p>

<p>Prospective study design characterizing long-term effects of pmTBI on both global (brain age) and regional (hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and cortical thickness) brain structure at approximately 7 days, 4 months, and 1-year post-injury. A large sample of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was imaged at identical temporal intervals to account for typical neurodevelopmental changes, and to assess how trauma potentially affects developmental trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 269 pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 41.6% female) and 232 healthy controls (age = 14.1 ± 2.9; 44.8% female) were included in the final analyses (&gt;70% 1-year retention). Results demonstrated that the presence of loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia was associated with increased brain age up to 1-year post-injury, increased frontal cortical thickness at 4 months, as well as hippocampal atrophy across all time points relative to controls. “Mild” head trauma also interfered with hippocampal neurodevelopment in a dose-dependent fashion, including within the CA1 subfield. In contrast, post-concussive symptom burden was not associated with any structural abnormalities or alterations to neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Current findings suggest a dose-dependent relationship between injury severity and alterations in both global and regional brain structure within the spectrum of pmTBI. Our results emphasize the importance of using objective biomarkers rather than subjective self-reported symptoms to better understand the long-term effects of injury.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prognostication in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) remains challenging because of heterogeneous etiologies, pathophysiologies and, consequently, highly variable electroencephalograms (EEGs). Here, we use EEG patterns that are well-characterizable to create a latent map that positions novel EEGs along a continuum. We asses this map as a generalizable tool to extract prognostically valuable information from long-term EEG, by predicting outcome post-cardiac arrest as a first use case.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Categorizable EEGs across the health-disease continuum (wake [W], sleep [rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM (N1, N2, N3)], ictal-interictal-continuum [lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD) and lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA)], seizures [SZ], burst suppression [BS]; 20,043 patients, 288,986 EEG segments) are arranged meaningfully in a low-dimensional space via a deep neural network, resulting in a universal map of EEG (UM-EEG). We assess prognostication after cardiac arrest (576 patients, recovery or death) based on long-term EEGs represented as trajectories in this continuous embedding space.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Classification of out-of-sample EEG match state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms while extending it to the currently largest set of classes across the health-disease continuum (mean area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUROCs] 1-vs-all classification: W, 0.94; REM, 0.92; N1, 0.85; N2, 0.91; N3, 0.98; GRDA, 0.97; LRDA, 0.97; SZ, 0.87; GPD, 0.99; LPD, 0.97; BS, 0.94). UM-EEG enables outcome prediction after cardiac arrest with an AUROC of 0.86 and identifies interpretable factors governing prognosis such as the distance to healthy states over time.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>UM-EEG presents a novel and physiologically meaningful representation to characterize brain states along the health-disease continuum. It offers new opportunities for personalized, long-term monitoring and prognostication. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:357–368</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Moderate-to-late preterm (MLP) infants contribute to the greatest proportion of preterm children with neurodevelopmental impairments. White matter injury (WMI) is common and predicts adverse outcomes in very preterm (VP) infants. However, little is known about white matter abnormality (WMA) in MLP infants. We investigated the burden and distribution of WMA in MLP infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MLP infants were recruited from a randomized trial on neonatal nutrition and a prospective observational cohort in New Zealand, and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) soon after birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA). WMA was manually segmented using an established method. Total and regional WMA volumes and percentage of WMA to total cerebral volume were calculated. Probabilistic WMA maps were generated and compared with WMI in VP infants and term infants with congenital heart disease.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 101 infants (32 females), 40 (39.6%) had WMA on at least 1 scan. In 37 infants with WMA who had both scans, WMA was less visible in 22 (59.5%) or undetectable in 7 (18.9%) infants with a mean reduction of 72.7 ± 207.5 mm<sup>3</sup> in WMA volume from early-life to term. Infants with and without WMA had mostly comparable pregnancy and neonatal characteristics. Probabilistic maps demonstrated a characteristic WMA topology, with most lesions in posterior followed by central and anterior regions. Trigonal areas were vulnerable across neonatal populations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>WMA is much more common in MLP infants than previously reported and occurs in a characteristic topology. WMA may be missed on TEA MRI, and its relationship with outcomes in MLP infants warrants attention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:329–340</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently available biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem [<sup>18</sup>f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent test dataset (n = 33).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:410–420</p>

                Astrocytes are glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that perform an array of diverse functions that are essential for brain activity. Studies on the functional diversity of astrocytes suggest that such diversity may be derived from specialized populations. We provide an overview of the current state of research on astrocyte diversity and outline current challenges and knowledge gaps while also examining the developmental origins of these populations and how their interactions with neurons contribute to their functional heterogeneity. We highlight recent studies that provide evidence for functionally diverse astrocyte populations under homeostatic conditions and as an adaptive response to a range of experiences. This review provides a framework for understanding the dynamic and heterogeneous features of astrocytes across the CNS.

                Neuronal death is a defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and motor neuron diseases, and is accordingly a priority drug target. Among the various cell death pathways, ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a prominent candidate underlying neurodegeneration. Despite its potential significance, putative triggers initiating lipid peroxidation cascades that lead to ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly characterized. This poses significant challenges for developing targeted and disease-specific therapies. We review evidence of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases and examine potential disease-relevant triggers of ferroptosis. We propose that ferroptosis, rather than being initiated by a single triggering event, emerges due to a cumulative erosion of anti-ferroptosis defense systems. This process is likely driven by context-dependent interplay between common hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, including neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid metabolism, and iron accumulation.

                Nuyttens et al. demonstrate that sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia results from impaired mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. While MPC and PCX remain functional, thiamine deficiency suppresses PDC activity. Septic mitochondria do enhance GPT2 activity to consume some pyruvate and to induce glutamate-mediated TCA anaplerosis. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) restores pyruvate oxidation, allowing a synergistic TPP-plus-glucose therapy.

                Antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiome leads to a transient loss of microbiome diversity (bacterial and viral) and causes blooms of bacteria and their viruses. Our analysis suggests that these viruses (phages) prey on bacteria that become dominant, thereby preventing their dominance and contributing to the recovery of microbiome balance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99473">Ultrastructural sublaminar-specific diversity of excitatory synaptic boutons in layer 1 of the adult human temporal lobe neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Layer (L)1, beside receiving massive cortico-cortical, commissural and associational projections, is the termination zone of tufted dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the area of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike initiation. However, its synaptic organization in humans is not known. Quantitative 3D models of excitatory synaptic boutons (SBs) in L1 of the human temporal lobe neocortex were generated from neocortical biopsy tissue using transmission electron microscopy, 3D-volume reconstructions, and TEM tomography. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and the readily releasable, recycling, and resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified. The majority of excitatory SBs contained numerous mitochondria comprising ~7% of the total volume, had a large macular, non-perforated AZ (~0.20 µm<sup>2</sup>) and were predominantly located on dendritic spines. Excitatory SBs had a total pool of ~3500 SVs, a relatively large readily releasable (~4 SVs), recycling (~470 SVs) and resting (~2900 SVs) pool. Astrocytic coverage of excitatory SBs suggests both synaptic crosstalk or removal of spilled glutamate by astrocytic processes at synaptic complexes. The structural composition of SBs in L1 may underlie the function of L1 networks that mediate, integrate, and synchronize contextual and cross-modal information, enabling flexible and state-dependent processing of feedforward sensory inputs from other layers of the cortical column.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106469">Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms of the tumor suppressor protein p53 exert dominant-negative effect primarily by co-aggregation</a></h4>

              
                p53 is a tumor suppressor protein with multiple isoforms with shared or specific functions. However, two of its isoforms, Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α, with large N-terminal deletions, can cause cancer. These isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53), although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase expression, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence assays, and apoptotic caspase activity assay. Our study elucidates that these DNA-binding deficient p53 isoforms form hetero-tetrameric complexes with FLp53 and disrupt FLp53’s DNA binding and transcriptional activities when present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer. However, these structurally unstable isoforms promote vigorous protein aggregation involving FLp53, disrupting its structure and sequestering it in the cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates, thereby limiting its availability to function as a transcription activator protein. Thus, co-aggregation of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α with FLp53, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is likely the primary factor contributing to their dominant-negative effect. Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104191">A single cysteine residue in vimentin regulates long non-coding RNA XIST to suppress epithelial–mesenchymal transition and stemness in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that is induced in a large number of solid tumours. A single cysteine at position 328 in vimentin plays a crucial role in assembly, organisation, and stability of IFs. However, its exact function during epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression has not been investigated. To investigate this, we have transduced wildtype (WT) and C328S vimentin separately in MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous vimentin. The expression of C328-VIM impacted vimentin–actin interactions and induced EMT-like features that include enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion accompanied by reduced cell adhesion when compared to the wildtype cells. Functional transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of EMT and mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers, as well as acquisition of signatures associated with cancer stemness (<i>CD56, POU5F1, PROCR,</i> and <i>CD49f</i>), thus transforming MCF-7 cells from oestrogen-positive to triple-reduced (<i>ESR1, PGR,</i> and <i>HER2</i>) status. We also observed a stark increase in the expression of long non-coding RNA, <i>XIST,</i> in MCF-7 cells expressing C328-VIM. Targeting the mutant vimentin or <i>XIST</i> by RNA interference partially reversed the phenotypes in C328-VIM-expressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the introduction of C328-VIM cells into nude mice promoted tumour growth by increasing cancer stemness in an oestrogen-independent manner. Altogether, our studies provide insight into how cysteine 328 in vimentin dictates mechano-transduction signals to remodel actin cytoskeleton and protect against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA <i>XIST</i>. Therefore, targeting vimentin and/or <i>XIST</i> via RNA interference should be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100162">Cntnap2 loss drives striatal neuron hyperexcitability and behavioral inflexibility</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by two major diagnostic criteria – persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (RRBs). Evidence from both human and animal model studies of ASD suggests that alteration of striatal circuits, which mediate motor learning, action selection, and habit formation, may contribute to the manifestation of RRBs. <i>CNTNAP2</i> is a syndromic ASD risk gene, and loss of function of <i>Cntnap2</i> in mice is associated with RRBs. How the loss of <i>Cntnap2</i> impacts striatal neuron function is largely unknown. In this study, we utilized <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice to test whether altered striatal neuron activity contributes to aberrant motor behaviors relevant to ASD. We find that <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibit enhanced cortical drive of direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs). This enhanced drive is due to increased intrinsic excitability of dSPNs, which make them more responsive to cortical inputs. We find that <i>Cntnap2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibit spontaneous repetitive behaviors, increased motor routine learning, perseveration, and cognitive inflexibility. Increased corticostriatal drive may therefore contribute to the acquisition of repetitive, inflexible behaviors in <i>Cntnap2</i> mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102230">Neural circuit mechanisms for steering control in walking Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Orienting behaviors provide a continuous stream of information about an organism’s sensory experiences and plans. Thus, to study the links between sensation and action, it is useful to identify the neurons in the brain that control orienting behaviors. Here, we describe descending neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain that predict and influence orientation (heading) during walking. We show that these cells have specialized functions: whereas one cell type predicts sustained low-gain steering, the other predicts transient high-gain steering. These latter cells integrate internally directed steering signals from the head direction system with stimulus-directed steering signals from multimodal sensory pathways. The inputs to these cells are organized to produce ‘see-saw’ steering commands, so that increasing output from one brain hemisphere is accompanied by decreasing output from the other hemisphere. Together, our results show that internal and external drives are integrated to produce descending motor commands with different timescales, for flexible and precise control of an organism’s orientation in space.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101413">Methamphetamine-induced adaptation of learning rate dynamics depend on baseline performance</a></h4>

              
                The ability to calibrate learning according to new information is a fundamental component of an organism’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. Yet, the exact neural mechanisms guiding dynamic learning rate adjustments remain unclear. Catecholamines appear to play a critical role in adjusting the degree to which we use new information over time, but individuals vary widely in the manner in which they adjust to changes. Here, we studied the effects of a low dose of methamphetamine (MA), and individual differences in these effects, on probabilistic reversal learning dynamics in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized design. Participants first completed a reversal learning task during a drug-free baseline session to provide a measure of baseline performance. Then they completed the task during two sessions, one with MA (20 mg oral) and one with placebo (PL). First, we showed that, relative to PL, MA modulates the ability to dynamically adjust learning from prediction errors. Second, this effect was more pronounced in participants who performed moderately low at baseline. These results present novel evidence for the involvement of catecholaminergic transmission on learning flexibility and highlights that baseline performance modulates the effect of the drug.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105277">Layilin regulates Treg motility and suppressive capacity in skin</a></h4>

              
                Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immune tolerance in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. We discovered that layilin, a C-type lectin receptor, is predominantly expressed on Tregs in skin. Layilin was highly expressed on a subset of clonally expanded ‘effector’ Tregs in both healthy and psoriatic human skin. Layilin-expressing Tregs exhibited a transcriptional profile indicative of enhanced adhesion. Deletion of layilin in Tregs in mice in vivo resulted in significantly attenuated skin inflammation. Mechanistically, layilin enhanced in vitro human Treg adhesion via modulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, resulting in distinct cytoskeletal alterations consistent with enhanced focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation. Taken together, we define layilin as a critical regulator of Treg-suppressive capacity by modulating motility and adhesion in a non-lymphoid tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102906">Q-learning with temporal memory to navigate turbulence</a></h4>

              
                We consider the problem of olfactory searches in a turbulent environment. We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in a few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.

">Corticothalamic Layer 6 Controls Cortical Activity and Thalamic Firing Mode in a Bidirectional Manner</a></h4>

              
                Corticothalamic layer 6 (L6CT) modulates information flow between cortical and thalamic circuits. Previous research reported contrasting inhibitory or excitatory effects of L6CT on cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting technological discrepancies or physiological differences in L6CT function. To resolve these discrepancies, we combined translaminar, multi-channel in vivo electrophysiology in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with optogenetic L6CT activation across a range of stimulation regimes to manipulate L6CT firing rate and frequency. Increasing L6CT firing rates exerted a transition from inhibition to excitation across cortical layers. Furthermore, L6CT activity imparted population synchrony onto distinct cortical subpopulations, independent of changes in overall L6CT activity. In the thalamus, L6CT modulated thalamic burst in a bidirectional manner, dependent on L6CT stimulation frequency. These results demonstrate that S1 L6CT can bidirectionally modulate both cortical firing and thalamic firing mode, elucidating a more nuanced function of S1 L6CT in thalamic and cortical signalling than previously recognised.

">A naturalistic reinforcement learning task uncovers historical neural representations</a></h4>

              
                Exploration is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in human development, facilitating cognitive and behavioral adaptation. However, conventional RL paradigms in neuroimaging studies often rely on highly constrained search spaces and artificial, non-naturalistic scenarios, limiting their capacity to reflect the complexity of real-world human exploration and decision-making. To address this gap, we developed a novel, naturalistic RL paradigm called Photographer, which involves a photograph-taking task set in a virtual street-view environment. Participants navigated city scenes and attempted to infer the paradigm's covert goal solely from feedback, defined as the conceptual similarity between their photograph and a hidden target sentence. Representational similarity analysis revealed that feedback history, an encoding of recent trial attempts, was robustly represented in the middle orbital gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. These neural representations were consistently observed across two independent participant groups. Moreover, although the two regions coactivated during exploration, each was associated with a distinct functional network.

">Purkinje cell collaterals preferentially target a subtype of molecular layer interneuron</a></h4>

              
                In addition to providing outputs from the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cell (PC) axon collaterals target other PCs, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), and Purkinje layer interneurons (PLIs). It was recently shown that MLIs consist of two subtypes, but the properties of PC synapses onto these subtypes was not known and it was assumed that all PC collateral to MLI synapses would provide positive feedback to PCs. Clarifying the PC connectivity onto MLI subtypes is vital to understating the influence of feedback from PC collaterals because MLI1s primarily inhibit PCs whereas MLI2s mainly inhibit MLI1s and disinhibit PCs. Here we use a combination of serial EM and optogenetic studies to characterize PC synapses onto MLI subtypes in mice. EM reconstructions show that PCs make 53% of their synapses onto other PCs, 32% onto PLIs, 6% onto MLI1s and 7% onto MLI2s. Since there are far more MLI1s than MLI2s, each MLI2 is expected to receive many more synapses than each MLI1. In slice experiments, optogenetic activation of PCs evokes inhibitory currents in most MLI2s, but primarily disinhibits MLI1s. We also find that candelabrum cells, a type of PLI, form many more synapses onto MLI1s than MLI2s. It is therefore expected that both PC-MLI2-MLI1-PC and PC-PLI-MLI1-PC pathways allow increased PC firing to disinhibit MLI1s, which are known to reduce dendritic PC calcium signals and suppress plasticity at granule cell to PC synapses. These pathways provide negative feedback that act in concert with PC-PC synapses to counter elevations in PC firing.

">Network Signatures of Disease Progression and Core Symptoms in Dementia with Lewy Bodies Distinct from Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background. Resting-state fMRI studies in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have described connectivity alterations in large-scale brain networks. However, little is known about functional changes across disease stages, particularly in DLB. Objective. To investigate functional connectivity of key brain networks in DLB patients at different stages, compare them to AD and healthy controls (HC) and examine associations with core clinical symptoms. Methods: Ninety DLB patients, comprising 63 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI-DLB) and 27 with dementia (d-DLB), along with 25 AD patients (11 MCI-AD and 14 d-AD) and 34 HC underwent clinical, neuropsychological and resting-state fMRI assessment. ROI-to-ROI analyses were performed using the CONN toolbox, (pFDR<0.05). Results: The DLB group showed reduced functional connectivity within the salience network (SN) compared with HC, but did not differ from AD. While MCI-DLB patients showed no significant differences, d-DLB patients showed reduced SN and frontoparietal network (FPN) connectivity compared to HC and AD. SN connectivity was associated with severity of fluctuations and FPN connectivity with REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline in DLB. In contrast, in the AD group, decreased default mode network (DMN) connectivity was associated with lower MMSE scores. Conclusion: SN and FPN connectivity impairments relate to disease progression and core clinical features in DLB, whereas DMN connectivity is linked to cognitive decline in AD. These distinct patterns highlight divergent paths of network dysfunction in the two diseases, offering insight into their underlying mechanisms and clinical expression.
