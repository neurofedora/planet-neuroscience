	<p>Objective: To assess the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the gait and postural control ability of patients with executive dysfunction (ED) after stroke. Methods: A total of 18 patients with ED after stroke were randomly assigned into two groups, including an experimental group and a sham group. Patients in both groups received routine rehabilitation therapy, and patients in the experimental group underwent rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 2 weeks (5 HZ, 80%MT, 1200 pulses). In the sham group, patients experienced sham stimulation treatment, in which the coil was placed vertically with the head. Before and after treatment, patients in both groups were subjected to Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scoring, Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment of lower extremity (L-FMA), Stroop color-word test (SCWT), gait analysis, foot plantar pressure test, 10-m walking test (10MWT), Berg balance scale (BBS), and timed up and go test (TUGT). In the SCWT, it was attempted to record the time of each card (SCWT-T), the correct number (SCWT-C), Stroop interference effect-time (SIE-T), and SIE correct count (SIE-C). The TUGT was categorized into four stages: getting up (GT), walking straight (WT), turning around (TT), and sitting down (ST), in which the total time of TUGT was calculated. Results: After two weeks of treatment, the evaluation indexes were improved in the two groups, some of which were statistically significant. In the experimental group, SCWT-T, SIE-T, SIE-C, GT, WT, TT, ST, and TUGT were significantly improved after treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and activities of daily living were not statistically different from those before treatment (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). After treatment, SCWT-T, SIE-C, SIE-T, BBS score, TT, and ST in the experimental group were significantly shorter than those before treatment, with statistical differences (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the sham group, SCWT-C, L-FMA score, 10MWT, GT, WT, TUGT, stride length, step width, foot plantar pressure, pressure center curve, and motor skills were not significantly improved (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion: It was revealed that post-stroke rTMS treatment of patients with ED could improve executive function, improve postural control function, and reduce the risk of falling. In addition, rTMS of DLPFC could be a therapeutic target for improving postural control ability and reducing the risk of falling.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the association between serum iron (SI) and postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We retrospectively analyzed 985 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with aSAH. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to assess the association between SI and DCI. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was implemented to reduce confounding. Postoperative DCI developed in 14.38% of patients. Lower SI upon admission was detected in aSAH patients with severe clinical conditions and severe aSAH. SI was negatively correlated with WFNS grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.3744, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and modified Fisher (mFisher) grade (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.2520, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed lower SI was independently associated with DCI [odds ratios (OR) 0.281, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.177&amp;amp;ndash;0.448, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001], while WFNS grade and mFisher grade were not. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of SI for DCI gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7 and an optimal cut-off of 7.5 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L (95% CI 0.665 to 0.733, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). PSM demonstrated the DCI group had a significantly lower SI than the non-DCI group (10.91 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.86 vs. 20.34 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.01 &amp;amp;mu;mol/L, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Lower SI remained a significant independent predictor for DCI and an independent poor prognostic factor of aSAH in multivariate analysis (OR 0.363, 95% CI 0.209&amp;amp;ndash;0.630, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The predictive performance of SI for poor outcome had a corresponding AUC of 0.718 after PSM. Lower SI upon admission is significantly associated with WFNS grade, mFisher grade, and predicts postoperative DCI and poor outcome at 90 days following aSAH.</p>

	<p>Prior experience represents a prerequisite for memory consolidation across various memory systems. In the context of olfaction, sleep was found to enhance the consolidation of odors in adults but not in typically developing children (TDC), likely due to differences in pre-experience. Interestingly, unmedicated children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental condition related to dopamine dysfunction, showed lower perceptive thresholds for odors, potentially allowing for more odor experience compared to TDC. We investigated sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD. Twenty-eight children with ADHD and thirty age-matched TDC participated in an incidental odor recognition task. For the sleep groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the encoding of 10 target odorants took place in the evening, and the retention of odorants was tested with 10 target odorants and 10 distractor odorants the next morning. In the wake groups (ADHD: n = 14, TDC: n = 15), the time schedule was reversed. Odor memory consolidation was superior in the ADHD sleep group compared to the TDC sleep and the ADHD wake groups. Intensity and familiarity ratings during encoding were substantially higher in ADHD compared to TDC. Sleep-associated odor memory consolidation in ADHD is superior to TDC. Abundant pre-experience due to lower perceptive thresholds is suggested as a possible explanation. Olfaction might serve as a biomarker in ADHD.</p>

	<p>Collateral status has prognostic and treatment implications in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Unlike CTA, grading collaterals on MRA is not well studied. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of assessing collaterals on pretreatment MRA in AIS patients against DSA. AIS patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion with baseline MRA and subsequent endovascular treatment were included. MRA collaterals were evaluated by two neuroradiologists independently using the Tan and Maas scoring systems. DSA collaterals were evaluated by using the American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology grading system and were used as the reference for comparative analysis against MRA. A total of 104 patients met the inclusion criteria (59 female, age (mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD): 70.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.1). The inter-rater agreement (k) for collateral scoring was 0.49, 95% CI 0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.61 for the Tan score and 0.44, 95% CI 0.26&amp;amp;ndash;0.62 for the Maas score. Total number (%) of sufficient vs. insufficient collaterals based on DSA was 49 (47%) and 55 (53%) respectively. Using the Tan score, 45% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 64% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified in comparison to DSA, resulting in a poor agreement (0.09, 95% CI 0.1&amp;amp;ndash;0.28). Using the Maas score, only 4% of patients with sufficient collaterals and 93% with insufficient collaterals were correctly identified against DSA, resulting in poor agreement (0.03, 95% CI 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.13). Pretreatment MRA in AIS patients has limited concordance with DSA when grading collaterals using the Tan and Maas scoring systems.</p>

	<p>Background: Sketching while narrating is an effective interview technique for eliciting information and cues to deceit. The current research examined the effects of introducing a Model Sketch in investigative interviews andis pre-registered on https://osf.io/kz9mc (accessed on 18 January 2022). Methods: Participants (N = 163) completed a mock mission and were asked to tell the truth or to lie about it in an interview. In Phase 1 of the interview, participants provided either a free recall (control condition), sketched and narrated with exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-present condition), or sketched and narrated without exposure to a Model Sketch (Model Sketch-absent condition). In Phase 2, all participants provided a free recall without sketching. Results: Truth tellers reported significantly more information than lie tellers. The Model Sketch elicited more location details than a Free recall in Phase 1 and more veracity differences than the other Modality conditions in Phase 2. Conclusion: The Model Sketch seems to enhance the elicitation of information and to have carryover veracity effects in a follow-up free recall.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of heterogeneous instantaneous reproduction numbers with application to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Massachusetts counties</a></h4>

The reproductive number is an important metric that has been widely used to quantify the infectiousness of communicable diseases. The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real-time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities—a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of COVID-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using CDC case report data and the human mobility data collected by SafeGraph. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-to-brain communication during musical improvisation: a performance case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Understanding and predicting others' actions in ecological settings is an important research goal in social neuroscience. Here, we deployed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) methodology to analyze inter-brain communication between professional musicians during a live jazz performance. Specifically, bispectral analysis was conducted to assess the synchronization of scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from three expert musicians during a three-part 45 minute jazz performance, during which a new musician joined every five minutes. The bispectrum was estimated for all musician dyads, electrode combinations, and five frequency bands. The results showed higher bispectrum in the beta and gamma frequency bands (13-50 Hz) when more musicians performed together, and when they played a musical phrase synchronously. Positive bispectrum amplitude changes were found approximately three seconds prior to the identified synchronized performance events suggesting preparatory cortical activity predictive of concerted behavioral action. Moreover, a higher amount of synchronized EEG activity, across electrode regions, was observed as more musicians performed, with inter-brain synchronization between the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions the most frequent. Increased synchrony between the musicians' brain activity reflects shared multi-sensory processing and movement intention in a musical improvisation task.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Midazolam prevents the adverse outcome of neonatal asphyxia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Birth asphyxia (BA) is the most frequent cause of neonatal death as well as CNS injury. BA is often associated with neonatal seizures, which only poorly respond to anti-seizure medications and may contribute to the adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Using a non-invasive rat model of BA, we have recently reported that the potent benzodiazepine, midazolam, prevents neonatal seizures in ~50% of rat pups. In addition to its anti-seizure effect, midazolam exerts anti-inflammatory actions, which is highly relevant for therapeutic intervention following BA. The two major aims of the present study were to examine (1) whether midazolam reduces the adverse outcome of BA, and (2) whether this effect is different in rats that did or did not exhibit neonatal seizures after drug treatment.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive tests were performed over 14 months after asphyxia, followed by immunohistochemical analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All vehicle-treated rats had seizures after asphyxia and developed behavioral and cognitive abnormalities, neuroinflammation in gray and white matter, neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus, and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting in subsequent months. Administration of midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) directly after asphyxia prevented post-asphyctic seizures in ~50% of the rats and resulted in the prevention or decrease of neuroinflammation and the behavioral, cognitive, and neurodegenerative consequences of asphyxia. Except for neurodegeneration in the thalamus, seizures did not seem to contribute to the adverse outcome of asphyxia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-modifying effect of midazolam identified here strongly suggests that this drug provides a valuable option for improving the treatment and outcome of BA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of cortical superficial siderosis with post‐stroke epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is associated with neuroimaging findings of hemosiderin in a case-control study and whether the addition of hemosiderin markers improves the risk stratification models of PSE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of PROgnosis of POST-Stroke Epilepsy (PROPOSE) study enrolling PSE patients at our hospital from November 2014 to September 2019. PSE was diagnosed when one unprovoked seizure was experienced more than 7 days after the index stroke, as proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. As controls, consecutive acute stroke patients with no history or absence of any late seizure or continuing antiseizure medications at least 3 months after stroke were retrospectively enrolled during the same study period. We examined cortical microbleeds and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) using gradient-echo T2*-weighted images. A logistic regression model with ridge penalties was tuned using 10-fold cross-validation. We added the item of cSS to the existing models (SeLECT and CAVE) for predicting PSE and evaluated performance of new models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study included 180 patients with PSE (67 women; median age, 74 years) and 1183 controls (440 women; median age, 74 years). The cSS frequency was higher in PSE than control groups (48.9% vs 5.7%, p&lt;0.0001). Compared with the existing models, the new models with cSS (SeLECT-S and CAVE-S) demonstrated significantly better predictive performance of PSE [net reclassification improvement, 0.63 (<i>p</i>=0.004) for SeLECT-S and 0.88 (<i>p</i>=0.001) for CAVE-S at the testing data].</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>cSS was associated with PSE, stratifying stroke survivors at high risk of PSE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Artificial Intelligence software to interpret brain computed tomography in patients with stroke: External validation of e‐ASPECTS software</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test e-ASPECTS software in patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) imaging and quantify ischemic extent using ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using CT from nine stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative ‘front door’ hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, hemorrhage) in the representative population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4100 patients (51% female, median age 78 years, NIHSS 10, onset to scan 2·5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval, 70-72%) for detecting ischemic features, 85% (83-86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs &lt;1%) than experts.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of AI software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Transverse myelitis following SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination: a pharmacoepidemiological study in the World Health Organization's database</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse Myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the five U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase®, the World Health Organization’s pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the Information Component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to FDA or EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Secondly, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase®.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n=364; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.62) and vector-based (n=136; IC<sub>025</sub>=0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labelled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per one million vaccine doses, the risk-benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncovering natural variation in root system architecture and growth dynamics using a robotics-assisted phenomics platform</a></h4>

              
                The plant kingdom contains a stunning array of complex morphologies easily observed above-ground, but more challenging to visualize below-ground. Understanding the magnitude of diversity in root distribution within the soil, termed root system architecture (RSA), is fundamental to determining how this trait contributes to species adaptation in local environments. Roots are the interface between the soil environment and the shoot system and therefore play a key role in anchorage, resource uptake, and stress resilience. Previously, we presented the GLO-Roots (Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots) system to study the RSA of soil-grown <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants from germination to maturity (Rellán-Álvarez et al. 2015). In this study, we present the automation of GLO-Roots using robotics and the development of image analysis pipelines in order to examine the temporal dynamic regulation of RSA and the broader natural variation of RSA in Arabidopsis, over time. These datasets describe the developmental dynamics of two independent panels of accessions and reveal highly complex and polygenic RSA traits that show significant correlation with climate variables of the accessions' respective origins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ait1 regulates TORC1 signaling and localization in budding yeast</a></h4>

              
                The target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2 (RagA/C in humans), and the GTPase activating complex SEAC/GATOR. However, it remains unclear if, and how, other proteins/pathways regulate TORC1 in simple eukaryotes like yeast. Here we report that the previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, Ait1, binds to TORC1-Gtr1/2 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and holds TORC1 around the vacuole during log-phase growth. Then, during amino acid starvation, Ait1 inhibits TORC1 via Gtr1/2 using a loop that resembles the RagA/C binding domain in the human protein SLC38A9. Importantly, Ait1 is only found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, two closely related families of yeast that have lost the ancient TORC1 regulators Rheb and TSC1/2. Thus, the TORC1 circuit found in the <i>Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae</i>, and likely other simple eukaryotes, has undergone significant rewiring during evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the ribonucleotide reductase family reveals an ancestral clade</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are used by all free-living organisms and many viruses to catalyze an essential step in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of DNA precursors. RNRs are remarkably diverse by primary sequence and cofactor requirement, while sharing a conserved fold and radical-based mechanism for nucleotide reduction. Here, we structurally aligned the diverse RNR family by the conserved catalytic barrel to reconstruct the first large-scale phylogeny consisting of 6,779 sequences that unites all extant classes of the RNR family and performed evo-velocity analysis to independently validate our evolutionary model. With a robust phylogeny in-hand, we uncovered a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade that is placed as ancestral to the classes I and II RNRs, which we have termed clade Ø. We employed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and AlphaFold2 to investigate a member of this clade from <i>Synechococcus</i> phage S-CBP4 and report the most minimal RNR architecture to-date. Based on our analyses, we propose an evolutionary model of diversification in the RNR family and delineate how our phylogeny can be used as a roadmap for targeted future study.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Most cancers carry a substantial deleterious load due to Hill-Robertson interference</a></h4>

              
                Cancer genomes exhibit surprisingly weak signatures of negative selection<sup>1,2</sup>. This may be because selective pressures are relaxed or because genome-wide linkage prevents deleterious mutations from being removed (Hill-Robertson interference)<sup>3</sup>. By stratifying tumors by their genome-wide mutational burden, we observe negative selection (dN/dS ~ 0.56) in low mutational burden tumors, while remaining cancers exhibit dN/dS ratios ~1. This suggests that most tumors do not remove deleterious passengers. To buffer against deleterious passengers, tumors upregulate heat shock pathways as their mutational burden increases. Finally, evolutionary modeling finds that Hill-Robertson interference alone can reproduce patterns of attenuated selection and estimates the total fitness cost of passengers to be 46% per cell on average. Collectively, our findings suggest that the lack of observed negative selection in most tumors is not due to relaxed selective pressures, but rather the inability of selection to remove deleterious mutations in the presence of genome-wide linkage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Specific binding of Hsp27 and phosphorylated Tau mitigates abnormal Tau aggregation-induced pathology</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid aggregation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) into neurofibrillary tangles is closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Several molecular chaperones have been reported to bind Tau and impede its pathological aggregation. Recent findings of elevated levels of Hsp27 in the brains of patients with AD suggested its important role in pTau pathology. However, the molecular mechanism of Hsp27 in pTau aggregation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hsp27 partially co-localizes with pTau tangles in the brains of patients with AD. Notably, phosphorylation of Tau by microtubule affinity regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), dramatically enhances the binding affinity of Hsp27 to Tau. Moreover, Hsp27 efficiently prevents pTau fibrillation in vitro and mitigates neuropathology of pTau aggregation in a <i>Drosophila</i> tauopathy model. Further mechanistic study reveals that Hsp27 employs its N-terminal domain to directly interact with multiple phosphorylation sites of pTau for specific binding. Our work provides the structural basis for the specific recognition of Hsp27 to pathogenic pTau, and highlights the important role of Hsp27 in preventing abnormal aggregation and pathology of pTau in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chronic neurotransmission increases the susceptibility of lateral-line hair cells to ototoxic insults</a></h4>

              
                Sensory hair cells receive near constant stimulation by omnipresent auditory and vestibular stimuli. To detect and encode these stimuli, hair cells require steady ATP production, which can be accompanied by a buildup of mitochondrial byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS buildup is thought to sensitize hair cells to ototoxic insults, including the antibiotic neomycin. Work in neurons has shown that neurotransmission is a major driver of ATP production and ROS buildup. Therefore, we tested whether neurotransmission is a significant contributor to ROS buildup in hair cells. Using genetics and pharmacology, we disrupted two key aspects of neurotransmission in zebrafish hair cells: presynaptic calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. We find that chronic block of neurotransmission enhances hair-cell survival when challenged with the ototoxin neomycin. This reduction in ototoxin susceptibility is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial activity, likely due to a reduced ATP demand. In addition, we show that mitochondrial oxidation and ROS buildup are reduced when neurotransmission is blocked. Mechanistically, we find that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle rather than presynaptic- or mitochondrial-calcium influx that contributes most significantly to this metabolic stress. Our results comprehensively indicate that, over time, neurotransmission causes ROS buildup that increases the susceptibility of hair cells to ototoxins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The skeletal muscle circadian clock regulates titin splicing through RBM20</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are maintained by a cell autonomous, transcriptional-translational feedback loop known as the molecular clock. While previous research suggests a role of the molecular clock in regulating skeletal muscle structure and function, no mechanisms have connected the molecular clock to sarcomere filaments. Utilizing inducible, skeletal muscle specific, <i>Bmal1</i> knockout (iMS<i>Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we showed that knocking out skeletal muscle clock function alters titin isoform expression using RNAseq, LC-MS, and SDS-VAGE. This alteration in titin's spring length resulted in sarcomere length heterogeneity. We demonstrate the direct link between altered titin splicing and sarcomere length <i>in vitro</i> using U7 snRNPs that truncate the region of titin altered in iMS<i>Bmal1</i><sup>-/-</sup> muscle. We identified a mechanism whereby the skeletal muscle clock regulates titin isoform expression through transcriptional regulation of <i>Rbm20</i>, a potent splicing regulator of titin. Lastly, we used an environmental model of circadian rhythm disruption and identified significant down-regulation of <i>Rbm20</i> expression. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the skeletal muscle circadian clock in maintaining titin isoform through regulation of RBM20 expression. Because circadian rhythm disruption is a feature of many chronic diseases, our results highlight a novel pathway that could be targeted to maintain skeletal muscle structure and function in a range of pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Object Representations Rely on Integrative Coding</a></h4>

              
                Combining information from multiple senses is essential to object recognition. Yet how the mind combines sensory input into coherent multimodal representations, the multimodal binding problem, remains poorly understood. Here, we applied multi-echo fMRI across a four-day paradigm, in which participants learned 3-dimensional multimodal object representations created from well-characterized visual shape and sound features. Our novel paradigm decoupled the learned multimodal object representations from their baseline unimodal shape and sound features, thus tracking the emergence of multimodal concepts as they were learned by healthy adults. Critically, the representation for the whole object was different from the combined representation of its individual parts, with evidence of an integrative object code in anterior temporal lobe structures. Intriguingly, the perirhinal cortex, an anterior temporal lobe structure, was by default biased towards visual shape, but this initial shape bias was attenuated with learning. Pattern similarity analyses suggest that after learning the perirhinal cortex orthogonalized combinations of visual shape and sound features, transforming overlapping feature input into distinct multimodal object representations. These results provide evidence of integrative coding in the anterior temporal lobes that is distinct from the distributed sensory features, advancing the age-old question of how the mind constructs multimodal objects from their component features.

                Our current understanding of visual word identification is difficult to extend to text reading; both experiments and theories focus primarily, if not exclusively, on out-of-context individual words. Here, we try to fill this gap by studying cross-word semantic and morphological priming within sentences in natural reading, in a novel coregistration paradigm with simultaneous recording of eye movements and electroencephalography. We report results from both eye tracking measures, and, more importantly, from fixation-related potentials, time-locked to the fixation onset on the target word. In both, semantic facilitation clearly emerged, while we observed no effect of morphological priming. These results may indicate that morphological agreement is at least partially computed outside of the lexical-semantic system which gives rise to semantic priming. These results provide new insight into the neural correlates of semantic and morphological priming in natural reading, revealing lexical dynamics as they likely emerge in our everyday reading experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cross-species study of sex chromosome dosage effects on mammalian brain anatomy</a></h4>

              
                All eutherian mammals show chromosomal sex determination with contrasting sex chromosome dosages (SCDs) between males (XY) and females (XX). Studies in transgenic mice and humans with sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) have revealed direct SCD effects on regional mammalian brain anatomy, but we lack a formal test for cross-species conservation of these effects. Here, we develop a harmonized framework for comparative structural neuroimaging and apply this to systematically profile SCD effects on regional brain anatomy in both humans and mice by contrasting groups with SCT (XXY and XYY) vs. XY controls. We show that total brain size is substantially altered by SCT in humans (significantly decreased by XXY and increased by XYY), but not in mice. Controlling for global effects reveals robust and spatially convergent effects of XXY and XYY on regional brain volume in humans, but not mice. However, mice do show subtle effects of XXY and XYY on regional volume, although there is not a general spatial convergence in these effects within mice or between species. Notwithstanding this general lack of conservation in SCT effects, we detect several brain regions that show overlapping effects of XXY and XYY both within and between species (cerebellum, parietal, and orbitofrontal cortex) - thereby nominating high priority targets for future translational dissection of SCD effects on the mammalian brain. Our study introduces a generalizable framework for comparative neuroimaging in humans and mice and applies this to achieve a cross-species comparison of SCD effects on the mammalian brain through the lens of SCT.

                We suggest a novel analysis method called the one-to-many dynamic functional connectivity analysis to detect the adaptation of dynamics in a local brain network depending on mental states with a single case study. We collected fMRI BOLD signals from a blind subject whom with advanced ability in episodic memory retrieval while the subject was resting and retrieving a morning routine which is a type of autobiographical episodic memory. The default mode network is known for its high activation in these mental states. By applying the principal components analysis to the partial correlations of a brain region in the default mode network, which are correlations of the brain region to the rest of the network, we compared how congruent first or second principal components of the partial correlations of the brain region the default mode network in the two mental states. Our results showed that the adaption of the dynamics in the default mode network in the two mental states could be well depicted when the partial correlations of the posterior cingulate cortex are considered. Specifically, the correlation of the posterior cingulate cortex and the right parahippocampal cortex contributed mostly to the adaptation of the partial correlations of the posterior cingulate cortex for this single subject case.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walk the Plank! Using mobile EEG to investigate emotional lateralization of immersive fear in virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                Most studies on emotion processing rely on the presentation of emotional images or films. However, this methodology lacks ecological validity, limiting the extent to which findings can generalize to emotion processing in the wild. More realistic paradigms using Virtual Reality (VR) may be better suited to investigate authentic emotional states and their neuronal correlates. This preregistered study examines the neuronal underpinnings of naturalistic fear, measured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Seventy five healthy participants entered a simulation in which they walked across a virtual plank which extended from the side of a skyscraper either 80 stories up (the negative condition) or at street level (the neutral condition). Subjective ratings showed that the negative condition induced feelings of fear and presence. Following the VR experience, subjects passively viewed negative and neutral images from the International Affective Picture system (IAPS) outside of VR. We compared frontal alpha asymmetry between the plank and IAPS task and across valence of the conditions. Asymmetry indices (AI) in the plank task revealed greater right-hemispheric lateralization during the negative VR condition, relative to the neutral VR condition and to IAPS viewing. Within the IAPS task, no significant asymmetries were detected, though AIs in the VR task and in the IAPS task were negatively correlated suggesting that stronger right-hemispheric activation in the VR task was associated with stronger left-hemispheric activation during the IAPS task. In summary, our findings indicate that immersive technologies such as VR can advance emotion research by providing more ecologically valid ways to induce emotion.

                Elucidating the coupling between the structure and the function of the brain and its development across maturation has attracted a lot of interest in the field of network neuroscience in the last fifteen years. Mounting evidence support the hypothesis that the interplay between the structural architecture and the functional processes of the brain plays an important role in the onset of certain brain disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. This papers introduces a method called NBS-SNI that integrates both representations into a single framework, and identifies connectivity abnormalities in case-control studies. With this method, significance is given to the properties of the nodes, as well as to the connections between them. This approach builds on the well-established Network-based statistics (NBS) proposed in 2010. We uncover and identify the regimes in which NBS-SNI offers a gain in statistical resolution to identify a contrast of interest using synthetic data. We also apply our method on a real case-control study of individuals diagnosed with autism. Using NBS-SNI and node properties such as the closeness centrality and local information dimension, we found both hypo and hyperconnected subnetworks and show that our method can offer a 9 percentage points gain in prediction power over the standard NBS.

                The 2{delta}3 auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels is required for normal synaptic transmission and precise temporal processing of sounds in the auditory brainstem. In mice its loss additionally leads to an inability to distinguish amplitude-modulated (AM) tones. Furthermore, loss of function of 2{delta}3 has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. To investigate possible alterations of network activity in the high-order auditory system in 2{delta}3 KO mice, we analyzed neuronal activity patterns and topography of frequency tuning within networks of the auditory cortex (AC) using two-photon Ca2+ imaging. We found subfield-specific alterations, expressed in overall lower correlations between the network activity patterns in response to different sounds as well as lower reliability of these patterns upon repetitions of the same sound in the primary auditory cortex (A1). Higher AC subfields did not display these alterations but showed a higher amount of well-tuned neurons along with lower local heterogeneity of the neurons' frequency tuning. Our results provide new insight into AC network activity alterations in an ASD-associated mouse model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving fMRI in Parkinson's Disease by Accounting for Brain Region-Specific Activity Patterns</a></h4>

              
                In functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in Parkinson's disease (PD), a paradigm consisting of blocks of finger tapping and rest along with a corresponding general linear model (GLM) is often used to assess motor activity. However, this method has three limitations: (i) Due to the Strong magnetic field and the confined environment of the cylindrical bore, it is troublesome to accurately monitor motor output and, therefore, variability in the performed movement is typically ignored. (ii) Given the loss of dopaminergic neurons and ongoing compensatory brain mechanisms, motor control is abnormal in PD. Therefore, modeling of patients' tapping with a constant amplitude (using a boxcar function) and the expected Parkinsonian motor output are prone to mismatch. (iii). The motor loop involves structures with distinct hemodynamic responses, for which only one type of modeling (e.g., modeling the whole block of finger tapping) may not suffice to capture these structure's temporal activation. The first two limitations call for considering results from online recordings of the real motor output that may lead to significant sensitivity improvements. This was shown in previous work using a non-magnetic glove to capture details of the patients' finger movements in a so-called kinematic approach. For the third limitation, modeling motion initiation instead of the whole tapping block has been suggested to account for different temporal activation signatures of the motor loop's structures. In the present study we propose improvements to the GLM as a tool to study motor disorders. For this, we test the robustness of the kinematic approach in an expanded cohort (n=31), apply more conservative statistics than in previous work, and evaluate the benefits of an event-related model function. Our findings suggest that the integration of the kinematic approach offers a general improvement in detecting activations in subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia. Additionally, modeling motion initiation using an event-related design yielded superior performance in capturing medication-related effects in the putamen. Our results may guide adaptations in analysis strategies for functional motor studies related to PD and also in more general applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glycemic challenge is associated with the rapid cellular activation of the locus ceruleus and nucleus of solitary tract: Circumscribed spatial analysis of phosphorylated MAP kinase immunoreactivity in relation to catecholaminergic and cholinergic chemoarc</a></h4>

              
                Research using laboratory rats has shown that impaired glucose utilization or hypoglycemia is associated with cellular activation of neurons in the medulla (Winslow, 1733) (MY) that are implicated in the control of feeding behavior and hormonal counterregulatory responses. Changes in the activation of these neuronal populations are also associated with autonomic dysfunction that manifests itself in the form of blunted counterregulatory responses to repeated episodes of glucoprivation or hypoglycemia. An improved appreciation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these medullary responses (and the phenotypes of the neurons responsible for them) could lead to the development of rational therapies or diagnostics to address patient complications associated with diabetes management, such as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure. At present, however, cellular-scale neural activation following glycemic challenge has been tracked in rodents primarily within hours of the challenge, rather than sooner, and these responses have been poorly mapped within standardized brain atlases in relation to the locations of cell types known to be present in the medulla and the larger Rhombic brain (His, 1893) (RB). Here, we report that within 15 min of receiving the glycemic challenge, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 250 mg/kg, i.v.), which is known to produce intracellular glucopenia and trigger glucoprivic feeding behavior, marked elevations were observed in the numbers of RB neuronal cell profiles immunoreactive for the cellular activation marker(s), phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinases (phospho-ERK1/2). Dual immunostaining experiments showed that some, but not all, of these neurons were catecholaminergic, as identified by immunostaining for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). To begin the process of mapping the locations of these rapidly-activated neurons in relation to known cytoarchitecture with standardized neuroanatomical nomenclature, we performed Nissl- and chemoarchitecture-based plane-of-section analysis to map their distributions at discrete rostrocaudal levels, along with associated basally-activated cholinergic and other catecholaminergic cell groups, within an open-access rat brain atlas. This analysis revealed that neurons of the locus ceruleus (Wenzel & Wenzel, 1812) (LC) and the nucleus of solitary tract (>1840) (NTS) displayed elevated numbers of phospho-ERK1/2+ neurons within 15 min following 2-DG administration. Notably, while catecholaminergic neurons co-labeled with phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity, many non-catecholaminergic NTS neurons also displayed such activation. Both 2-DG and saline-treated groups also displayed phospho-ERK1/2+ neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve (>1840), identified both by Nissl criteria and immunostaining for the cholinergic marker, choline acetyltransferase. Our results show that 2-DG-activation of certain RB catecholaminergic neurons is more rapid than perhaps previously realized, engaging neurons that serve multiple functional systems and are of varying cellular phenotypes. They also place these and other activated populations within standardized maps of cytoarchitectonically-defined RB regions, thereby streamlining their precise targeting and/or comparable mapping in preclinical rodent models of disease.

                The ability of synapses to maintain physiological levels of evoked neurotransmission is essential for neuronal stability. A variety of perturbations can disrupt neurotransmission, but synapses often compensate for disruptions and work to stabilize activity levels, using forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) is one such mechanism that is expressed at the model Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse. In PHP, neurotransmitter release increases in response to challenges to the synapse, resulting in the maintenance of evoked neurotransmission. Prior work separated PHP into two temporal phases, acute and chronic. Those data suggested that cytoplasmic calcium signaling was important for a long-term maintenance of PHP. Here we used a combination of transgenic Drosophila RNA interference and overexpression lines, along with NMJ electrophysiology, synapse imaging, and pharmacology to test if regulators of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin are necessary for the normal expression of acute or chronic forms of PHP. We found that either pre- or postsynaptic dysregulation of a Drosophila gene regulating calcineurin, sarah (sra), blocks PHP. Examination of tissue-specific data showed that increases and decreases in sra expression are both detrimental to PHP. Additionally, the acute and chronic phases of PHP are functionally separable depending entirely upon which sra genetic manipulation is used. Surprisingly, concurrent pre- and postsynaptic sra knockdown or overexpression ameliorated PHP blocks revealed in single tissue experiments. Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin corroborated this latter finding. Our results suggest that a discrete balance of calcineurin signaling is needed across multiple synapse tissue types and over different temporal phases to stabilize peripheral synaptic outputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PEZO-1 and TRP-4 mechanosensors are involved in mating behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Male mating in Caenorhabditis elegans is a complex behavior with a strong mechanosensory component. C. elegans has several characterized mechanotransducer proteins, but few have been shown to contribute to mating. Here, we investigated the roles of PEZO-1, a piezo channel, and TRP-4, a mechanotransducing TRPN channel, in male mating behavior. We show that pezo-1 is expressed in several male-specific neurons with known roles in mating. We show that, among other neurons, trp-4 is expressed in the PCA sensory neuron, which monitors relative sliding between the male and the hermaphrodite and inhibits neurons involved in vulva detection. Mutations in both genes compromise many steps of mating, including initial response to the hermaphrodite, scanning, turning, and vulva detection. We performed pan-neuronal imaging during mating between freely-moving mutant males and hermaphrodites. Both pezo-1 and trp-4 mutants showed spurious activation of the sensory neurons involved in vulva detection. In trp-4 mutants, this spurious activation might be caused by PCA failure to inhibit vulva-detecting neurons during scanning. Indeed, we show that without functional TRP-4, PCA fails to detect the relative sliding between the male and hermaphrodite. Cell-specific TRP-4 expression restores PCA's mechanosensory function. Our results demonstrate new roles for both PEZO-1 and TRP-4 mechanotransducers in C. elegans mating behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CDKL5 deficiency results in atypical subregion-specific expression of perineuronal nets in the mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, where children exhibit motor, speech, cognitive and visual deficits during development as well as early onset of seizures and infantile spasms. CDKL5 disorder results from de novo mutations in CDKL5, which phosphorylates proteins including MECP2, an epigenetic regulator of critical period plasticity. How mutations in CDKL5 gene result in these neurological deficits is unknown. Using a male CDKL5-null mouse model, we systematically characterize the expression of perineuronal nets, which are extracellular matrix structures surrounding parvalbumin+ GABAergic neurons in the primary visual cortex. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are considered to be barriers to synaptic plasticity, particularly at the end of critical period plasticity in binocular zone. In CDKL5-null male visual cortex, here we report an increase in high-intensity PNN expression in the binocular zone, a decrease in overall PNN expression in the monocular zone, and no differences in PNN expression in rostral V1. These results suggest that at the closure of the visual critical period plasticity, subregion-specific variations in PNN expression lead to functional differences in synaptic plasticity and ultimately, changes in visual function in male CDKL5-null mice. Additionally, the systematic characterization of subregion-specific expression patterns of perineuronal nets lay the groundwork for further studies to probe the roles for perineuronal nets beyond the binocular zone of the mouse primary visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Silencing long-descending inter-enlargement propriospinal neurons improves hindlimb stepping after contusive spinal cord injuries</a></h4>

              
                Spinal locomotor circuitry is comprised of rhythm generating centers, one for each limb, that are interconnected by local and long-distance propriospinal neurons thought to carry temporal information necessary for interlimb coordination and gait control. We showed previously that conditional silencing of the long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) that project from the lumbar to the cervical rhythmogenic centers (L1/L2 to C6), disrupts right-left alternation of both the forelimbs and hindlimbs without significantly disrupting other fundamental aspects of interlimb and speed-dependent coordination (Pocratsky et al., 2020). Subsequently, we showed that silencing the LAPNs after a moderate thoracic contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) resulted in better recovered locomotor function (Shepard et al., 2021). In this research advance, we focus on the descending equivalent to the LAPNs, the long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) that have cell bodies at C6 and terminals at L2. We found that conditional silencing of the LDPNs in the intact adult rat resulted in disrupted alternation of each limb pair (forelimbs and hindlimbs) and after a thoracic contusion SCI significantly improved locomotor function. These observations lead us to speculate that the LAPNs and LDPNs have similar roles in the exchange of temporal information between the cervical and lumbar rhythm generating centers, but that the partial disruption of the pathway after SCI limits the independent function of the lumbar circuitry. Silencing the LAPNs or LDPNs effectively permits or frees-up the lumbar circuitry to function independently.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Norepinephrine regulates Ca2+ signals and fate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) represent the most abundant group of proliferating cells in the adult central nervous system. OPCs serve as progenitors for oligodendrocyte (OLs) throughout the life, and contribute to developmental and adaptive myelination, and myelin repair during diseased state. OPCs make synaptic and extra-synaptic contacts with axons, and detect and respond to neuronal activity. How OPCs translate the information relayed by the neuronal activity into Ca2+ signals, which in turn influence their fate and survival, is less understood. We developed novel transgenic mouse lines expressing a cytosolic and membrane anchored variants of genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors (GCaMP6f or mGCaMP6s) in OPCs, performed 2-photon microscopy in the somatosensory cortex of the awake behaving mice, and simultaneously monitored intracellular Ca2+ signals and their cell-fate progression. We found Ca2+ signals in OPCs mainly occur within processes and confine to micrometer-size segments called Ca2+ microdomains. Microdomain Ca2+ signals enhanced in OPCs when mice engage in exploratory behavior. OPCs exhibit distinct Ca2+ signals while they proliferate to maintain their precursor pool or differentiate to generate new OL. When mice engaged in exploratory behavior, the cortical projections of noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus showed increased firing rate and norepinephrine release. Norepinephrine activated all three subtypes of alpha1 adrenergic receptor expressed by OPCs and evoked intracellular Ca2+ increase in OPCs. A chemogenetic activation of noradrenergic neurons, promoted differentiation of cortical OPCs into OL, and at the same time suppressed OPC proliferation rate. Hence, we uncovered that various cell types of oligodendrocyte lineage exhibits unique signatures of Ca2+ activity, which these cells might integrate for making their fate decisions, and norepinephrine signaling can be a potent regulator of OPC fate.

                The lateral line is a superficial sensory system responding to environmental hydrodynamic changes to orient locomotion of aquatic vertebrate species. Whether this system also detects chemical cues is unknown. We find that zebrafish lateral line hair cells express numerous chemoreceptors, including ionotropic receptors for serotonin. We show that the serotonin enriched in skin neuroepithelial cells is released upon injury and that environmental serotonin activates lateral line hair cells. We show that larval zebrafish exposed to serotonin in their environment rely on the lateral line to swim fast and away. These results uncover the sensory versatility of lateral line hair cells and how these properties modulate navigation in response to environmental stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantification of Monosynaptic Rabies Tracing Efficiency</a></h4>

              
                Retrograde monosynaptic tracing using glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus is an important component of the toolkit for investigation of neural circuit structure and connectivity. It allows for the identification of first-order presynaptic connections to cell populations of interest across both the central and peripheral nervous system, helping to decipher the complex connectivity patterns of neural networks that give rise to brain function. Despite its utility, the efficiency with which genetically modified rabies virus spreads retrogradely across synapses remains uncertain. While past studies have revealed conditions that can increase or decrease the numbers of presynaptic cells labeled, it is unknown what proportion of total inputs to a starter cell of interest are labeled. It is also unknown whether synapses that are more proximal or distal to the cell body are labeled with different efficiencies. Here we use a new rabies virus construct that allows for the simultaneous labeling of pre and postsynaptic specializations to quantify efficiency of spread at the synaptic level in mouse primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that with typical conditions about 40% of first-order presynaptic excitatory inputs are labeled. We show that using matched tracing conditions there is similar efficiency of spread from excitatory or inhibitory starter cell types. Furthermore, we find no difference in the efficiency of labeling of excitatory inputs to postsynaptic sites at different subcellular locations.

	<p>After the onset of ischemic stroke, ischemia&amp;amp;ndash;hypoxic cascades cause irreversible neuronal death. Neurons are the fundamental structures of the central nervous system, and mature neurons do not renew or multiply after death. Functional and structural recovery from neurological deficits caused by ischemic attack is a huge task. Hence, there remains a need to replace the lost neurons relying on endogenous neurogenesis or exogenous stem cell-based neuronal differentiation. However, the stem cell source difficulty and the risk of immune rejection of the allogeneic stem cells might hinder the wide clinical application of the above therapy. With the advancement of transdifferentiation induction technology, it has been demonstrated that astrocytes can be converted to neurons through ectopic expression or the knockdown of specific components. The progress and problems of astrocyte transdifferentiation will be discussed in this article.</p>

	<p>Since the hippocampus plays an important role in memory and spatial cognition, the study of spatial computation models inspired by the hippocampus has attracted much attention. This study relies mainly on reward signals for learning environments and planning paths. As reward signals in a complex or large-scale environment attenuate sharply, the spatial cognition and path planning performance of such models will decrease clearly as a result. Aiming to solve this problem, we present a brain-inspired mechanism, a Memory-Replay Mechanism, that is inspired by the reactivation function of place cells in the hippocampus. We classify the path memory according to the reward information and find the overlapping place cells in different categories of path memory to segment and reconstruct the memory to form a &amp;amp;ldquo;virtual path&amp;amp;rdquo;, replaying the memory by associating the reward information. We conducted a series of navigation experiments in a simple environment called a Morris water maze (MWM) and in a complex environment, and we compared our model with a reinforcement learning model and other brain-inspired models. The experimental results show that under the same conditions, our model has a higher rate of environmental exploration and more stable signal transmission, and the average reward obtained under stable conditions was 14.12% higher than RL with random-experience replay. Our model also shows good performance in complex maze environments where signals are easily attenuated. Moreover, the performance of our model at bifurcations is consistent with neurophysiological studies.</p>

	<p>According to DSM 5, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various topics that occupies the majority of the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s time for a period of at least six months. The aforementioned state causes distress and/or functional impairments. This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot study that evaluated the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and CBT with an SSRIs intervention program. The participants comprised 16 children and adolescents with GAD (8 males and 8 females) matched with 16 typically developing peers (8 males and 8 females) aged from 10 to 16 years old (M = 12.56 SD = 2.18). Baseline assessment consisted of event related potentials (ERPs), which indicated that participants with GAD presented cognitive deficits in attention and memory, as they exhibited longer P300 latencies. Following treatment with the CBT program and/or medication, children and adolescents with GAD did not present statistically significantly longer P300 latencies and reaction times in comparison to the control group. Lastly, children and adolescents who followed the CBT program or the CBT program with psychopharmacological assistance did not reveal statistically significant differences in 13 out of 15 topographic brain areas and in reaction time.</p>

	<p>The cerebellar region has four times as many brain cells as the brain, but whether the cerebellum functions in cognition, and how it does so, remain unexplored. In order to verify whether the cerebellum is involved in cognition, we chose to investigate whether the cerebellum is involved in the process of error judgment. We designed an experiment in which we could activate the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s error-related potentials (ErrP). We recruited 26 subjects and asked them to wear EEG caps with cerebellar regions designed by us to participate in the experiment so that we could record their EEG activity throughout the experiment. We successfully mitigated the majority of noise interference after a series of pre-processing of the data collected from each subject. Our analysis of the preprocessed data revealed that our experiment successfully activated ErrP, and that the EEG signals, including the cerebellum, were significantly different when subjects made errors compared to when they made correct judgments. We designed a feature extraction method that requires selecting channels with large differences under different classifications, firstly by extracting the time-frequency features of these channels, and then screening these features with sequence backward feature (SBS) selection. We use the extracted features as the input and different event types in EEG data as the labels for multiple classifiers to classify the data in the executive and feedback segments, where the average accuracy for two-class classification of executive segments can reach 80.5%. The major contribution of our study is the discovery of the presence of ErrP in cerebellar regions and the extraction of an effective feature extraction method for EEG data.</p>

	<p>This proof-of-concept (PoC) study presents a pipeline made by two blocks: 1. the identification of the network that generates interictal epileptic activity; and 2. the study of the time course of the electrical activity that it generates, called neurodynamics, and the study of its functional connectivity to the other parts of the brain. Network identification is achieved with the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, the neurodynamics quantified through signal complexity with the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and functional connectivity with the Directed Transfer Function (DTF). This PoC is enhanced by the data collected before and after neuromodulation via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, both Real and Sham) in a single drug-resistant epileptic person. We observed that the signal complexity of the epileptogenic network, reduced in the pre-Real, pre-Sham, and post-Sham, reached the level of the rest of the brain post-Real tDCS. DTF changes post-Real tDCS were maintained after one month. The proposed approach can represent a valuable tool to enhance understanding of the relationship between brain neurodynamics characteristics, the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation, and epileptic symptoms.</p>

	<p>Leksell stereotactic system-based aspiration biopsy is a common procedure in the neurosurgical treatment of deep-seated or multiple brain lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of frameless biopsy using VarioGuide compared to frame-based biopsy using the Leksell stereotactic system (LSS). We analyzed all brain biopsies using VarioGuide or LSS at our neurooncological Department of Neurosurgery in the University Hospital of Bonn between January 2018 and August 2020. We analyzed demographic data, duration of surgery, size of lesion, localization, and early complications. Uni-variable analyses were carried out on data from both groups. In total, 109 biopsies were compared (40 VarioGuide vs. 69 LSS). Patients with VarioGuide were significant older (74 (62&amp;amp;ndash;80) years vs. 67 (57&amp;amp;ndash;76) years; p = 0.03) and had a shorter duration of general anesthesia (163 (138&amp;amp;ndash;194) min vs. 193 (167&amp;amp;ndash;215) min, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We found no significant differences in surgery duration (VarioGuide median 28 min (IQR 20&amp;amp;ndash;38); LSS: median 30 min (IQR 25&amp;amp;ndash;39); p = 0.1352) or in early complication rates (5% vs. 7%; p = 0.644). A slightly higher false negative biopsy rate was registered in the LSS group (3 vs. 1; p = 0.1347). The size of the lesions also did not differ significantly between the two groups (18.31 &amp;amp;plusmn; 26.35 cm3 vs. 12.63 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.62; p = 0.15). Our data showed that biopsies performed using VarioGuide took significantly less time than LSS biopsies and did not differ in complication rates. Both systems offered a high degree of patient safety.</p>

	<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be a risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to the altered coagulation process and hyperinflammation. This study examined the risk factors, clinical profile, and hospital outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS. This study was a retrospective analysis of data from California State Inpatient Database (SID) during 2019 and 2020. COVID-19 hospitalizations with age &amp;amp;ge; 18 years during 2020 and a historical cohort without COVID-19 from 2019 were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes studied were in-hospital mortality and discharge to destinations other than home. There were 91,420 COVID-19 hospitalizations, of which, 1027 (1.1%) had AIS. The historical control cohort included 58,083 AIS hospitalizations without COVID-19. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality, discharge to destinations other than home, DVT, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS, compared to those without AIS. The odds of in-hospital mortality, DVT, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory failure were significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with AIS, compared to AIS hospitalizations without COVID-19. Although the prevalence of AIS was low among COVID-19 hospitalizations, it was associated with higher mortality and greater rates of discharges to destinations other than home.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Leptin Promotes Striatal Dopamine Release via Cholinergic Interneurons and Regionally Distinct Signaling Pathways</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopamine (DA) is a critical regulator of striatal network activity and is essential for motor activation and reward-associated behaviors. Previous work has shown that DA is influenced by the reward value of food, as well as by hormonal factors that reguate food intake and energy expenditure. Changes in striatal DA signaling also have been linked to aberrant eating patterns. Here we test the effect of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone involved in feeding and energy homeostasis regulation, on striatal DA release and uptake. Immunohistochemical evaluation identified leptin receptor (LepR) expression throughout mouse striatum, including on striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and their extensive processes. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), we found that leptin causes a concentration-dependent increase in evoked extra-cellular DA concentration ([DA]<SUB>o</SUB>) in dorsal striatum (dStr) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell in male mouse striatal slices, and also an increase in the rate of DA uptake. Further, we found that leptin increases ChI excitability, and that the enhancing effect of leptin on evoked [DA]<SUB>o</SUB> is lost when nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors are antagonized or when examined in striatal slices from mice lacking ACh synthesis. Evaluation of signaling pathways underlying leptin's action revealed a requirement for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the involvement of different downstream pathways in dStr and NAc core versus NAc shell. These results provide the first evidence for dynamic regulation of DA release and uptake by leptin within brain motor and reward pathways, and highlight the involvement of ChIs in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Given the importance of striatal dopamine (DA) in reward, motivation, motor behavior and food intake, identifying the actions of metabolic hormones on DA release in striatal subregions should provide new insight into factors that influence DA-dependent motivated behaviors. We find that one of these hormones, leptin, boosts striatal DA release through a process involving striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Moreover, we find that the intracellular cascades downstream from leptin receptor (LepR) activation that lead to enhanced DA release differ among striatal subregions. Thus, we not only show that leptin regulates DA release, but also identify characteristics of this process that could be harnessed to alter pathologic eating behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">APP Genetic Deficiency Alters Intracellular Ca2+ Homeostasis and Delays Axonal Degeneration in Dorsal Root Ganglion Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The activation of self-destructive cellular programs helps sculpt the nervous system during development, but the molecular mechanisms used are not fully understood. Prior studies have investigated the role of the APP in the developmental degeneration of sensory neurons with contradictory results. In this work, we sought to elucidate the impact of APP deletion in the development of the sensory nervous system <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro.</I> Our <I>in vivo</I> data show an increase in the number of sciatic nerve axons in adult male and female <I>APP-null</I> mice, consistent with the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the development of peripheral axons. <I>In vitro</I>, we show that genetic deletion of APP delays axonal degeneration triggered by nerve growth factor deprivation, indicating that APP does play a pro-degenerative role. Interestingly, APP depletion does not affect caspase-3 levels but significantly attenuates the rise of axoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs during degeneration. We examined intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms that could be involved and found that <I>APP-null</I> DRG neurons had increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. We also observed that DRG axons lacking APP have more mitochondria than their WT counterparts, but these display a lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, we present evidence that APP deficiency causes an increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that APP plays a pro-degenerative role in the developmental degeneration of DRG sensory neurons, and unveil the importance of APP in the regulation of calcium signaling in sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nervous system goes through a phase of pruning and programmed neuronal cell death during development to reach maturity. In such context, the role played by the APP in the peripheral nervous system has been controversial, ranging from pro-survival to pro-degenerative. Here we present evidence <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> supporting the pro-degenerative role of APP, demonstrating the ability of APP to alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mitochondria, critical players of programmed cell death. This work provides a better understanding of the physiological function of APP and its implication in developmental neuronal death in the nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Dopamine Receptor 1 Localization to Primary Cilia Impairs Signaling in Striatal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>A rod-shaped appendage called a primary cilium projects from the soma of most central neurons in the mammalian brain. The importance of cilia within the nervous system is highlighted by the fact that human syndromes linked to primary cilia dysfunction, collectively termed ciliopathies, are associated with numerous neuropathologies, including hyperphagia-induced obesity, neuropsychiatric disorders, and learning and memory deficits. Neuronal cilia are enriched with signaling molecules, including specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their downstream effectors, suggesting that they act as sensory organelles that respond to neuromodulators in the extracellular space. We previously showed that GPCR ciliary localization is disrupted in neurons from mouse models of the ciliopathy Bardet&ndash;Biedl syndrome (BBS). Based on this finding, we hypothesized that mislocalization of ciliary GPCRs may impact receptor signaling and contribute to the BBS phenotypes. Here, we show that disrupting localization of the ciliary GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in male and female mice, either by loss of a BBS protein or loss of the cilium itself, specifically in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons, results in obesity. Interestingly, the weight gain is associated with reduced locomotor activity, rather than increased food intake. Moreover, the loss of a BBS protein or cilia on D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons leads to a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling. Together, these results indicate that cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> activity in the nervous system and underscore the importance of neuronal cilia for proper GPCR signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most mammalian neurons possess solitary appendages called primary cilia. These rod-shaped structures are enriched with signaling proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), suggesting that they respond to neuromodulators. This study examines the consequences of disrupting ciliary localization of the GPCR dopamine receptor 1 (D<SUB>1</SUB>) in D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons. Remarkably, mice that have either an abnormal accumulation of D<SUB>1</SUB> in cilia or a loss of D<SUB>1</SUB> ciliary localization become obese. In both cases, the obesity is associated with lower locomotor activity rather than overeating. As D<SUB>1</SUB> activation increases locomotor activity, these results are consistent with a reduction in D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling. Indeed, we found that D<SUB>1</SUB>-mediated signaling is reduced in brain slices from both mouse models. Thus, cilia impact D<SUB>1</SUB> signaling in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spinal Cord Synaptic Plasticity by GlyR{beta} Release from Receptor Fields and Syndapin I-Dependent Uptake</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission is key for spinal cord function. Recent observations suggested that by largely elusive mechanisms also glycinergic synapses display synaptic plasticity. We imaged receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracked surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR), and studied differential regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions with the scaffold protein gephyrin and the F-BAR domain protein syndapin I and thereby reveal key principles of this process. S403 phosphorylation of GlyR&beta;, known to be triggered by synaptic signaling, caused a decoupling from gephyrin scaffolds but simultaneously promoted association of syndapin I with GlyR&beta;. In line, kainate treatments used to trigger rearrangements of glycine receptors in murine <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords (mixed sex) showed even more severe receptor field fragmentation than already observed in untreated <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords. Syndapin I deficiency furthermore resulted in more dispersed receptors and increased receptor mobility, also pointing out an important contribution of syndapin I to the organization of GlyR&beta; fields. Strikingly, <I>syndapin I</I> KO also led to a complete disruption of kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization. Accompanying quantitative ultrahigh-resolution studies in dissociated spinal cord neurons proved that the defects in GlyR internalization observed in <I>syndapin I</I> KO spinal cords are neuron-intrinsic defects caused by syndapin I deficiency. Together, our results unveiled important mechanisms organizing and altering glycine receptor fields during both steady state and particularly also as a consequence of kainate-induced synaptic rearrangement - principles organizing and fine-tuning synaptic efficacy and plasticity of glycinergic synapses in the spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Initial observations suggested that also glycinergic synapses, key for spinal cord and brainstem functions, may display some form of synaptic plasticity. Imaging receptor fields at ultrahigh-resolution at freeze-fractured membranes, tracking surface and internalized glycine receptors (GlyR) and studying regulations of GlyR&beta; interactions, we here reveal key principles of these kainate-inducible adaptations. A switch from gephyrin-mediated receptor scaffolding to syndapin I-mediated GlyR&beta; scaffolding and internalization allows for modulating synaptic receptor availability. In line, kainate-induced GlyR&beta; internalization was completely disrupted and GlyR&beta; receptor fields were distorted by <I>syndapin I</I> KO. These results unveiled important mechanisms during both steady-state and kainate-induced alterations of synaptic GlyR fields, principles underlying synaptic efficacy and plasticity of synapses in the spinal cord.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Electrophysiological Validation of Monosynaptic Connectivity between Premotor Interneurons and the aCC Motoneuron in the Drosophila Larval CNS</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to map the synaptic connectivity of entire larval and adult fly neural networks, which is essential for understanding nervous system development and function. So far, the project has produced an impressive amount of electron microscopy data that has facilitated reconstructions of specific synapses, including many in the larval locomotor circuit. While this breakthrough represents a technical tour de force, the data remain underutilized, partly because of a lack of functional validation of reconstructions. Attempts to validate connectivity posited by the connectome project, have mostly relied on behavioral assays and/or GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) or GCaMP imaging. While these techniques are useful, they have limited spatial or temporal resolution. Electrophysiological assays of synaptic connectivity overcome these limitations. Here, we combine patch-clamp recordings with optogenetic stimulation in male and female larvae, to test synaptic connectivity proposed by connectome reconstructions. Specifically, we use multiple driver lines to confirm that several connections between premotor interneurons and the anterior corner cell motoneuron are, as the connectome project suggests, monosynaptic. In contrast, our results also show that conclusions based on GRASP imaging may provide false-positive results regarding connectivity between cells. We also present a novel imaging tool, based on the same technology as our electrophysiology, as a favorable alternative to GRASP imaging. Finally, of eight Gal4 lines tested, five are reliably expressed in the premotor interneurons they are targeted to. Thus, our work highlights the need to confirm functional synaptic connectivity, driver line specificity, and use of appropriate genetic tools to support connectome projects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <I>Drosophila</I> connectome project aims to provide a complete description of connectivity between neurons in an organism that presents experimental advantages over other models. It has reconstructed hundreds of thousands of synaptic connections of the fly larva by manual identification of anatomic landmarks present in serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volumes of the larval CNS. We use a highly reliable electrophysiological approach to verify these connections, providing useful insight into the accuracy of work based on ssTEM. We also present a novel imaging tool for validating excitatory monosynaptic connections between cells and show that several genetic driver lines designed to target neurons of the larval connectome exhibit nonspecific and/or unreliable expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Clutter Substantially Reduces Selectivity for Peripheral Faces in the Macaque Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>According to a prominent view in neuroscience, visual stimuli are coded by discrete cortical networks that respond preferentially to specific categories, such as faces or objects. However, it remains unclear how these category-selective networks respond when viewing conditions are cluttered, i.e., when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. Here, we asked three questions: (1) Does clutter reduce the response and selectivity for faces as a function of retinal location? (2) Is the preferential response to faces uniform across the visual field? And (3) Does the ventral visual pathway encode information about the location of cluttered faces? We used fMRI to measure the response of the face-selective network in awake, fixating macaques (two female, five male). Across a series of four experiments, we manipulated the presence and absence of clutter, as well as the location of the faces relative to the fovea. We found that clutter reduces the response to peripheral faces. When presented in isolation, without clutter, the selectivity for faces is fairly uniform across the visual field, but, when clutter is present, there is a marked decrease in the selectivity for peripheral faces. We also found no evidence of a contralateral visual field bias when faces were presented in clutter. Nonetheless, multivariate analyses revealed that the location of cluttered faces could be decoded from the multivoxel response of the face-selective network. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that clutter blunts the selectivity of the face-selective network to peripheral faces, although information about their retinal location is retained.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous studies that have measured brain activity in macaques have found visual regions that respond preferentially to faces. Although these regions are thought to be essential for social behavior, their responses have typically been measured while faces were presented in isolation, a situation atypical of the real world. How do these regions respond when faces are presented with other stimuli? We report that, when clutter is present, the preferential response to foveated faces is spared but preferential response to peripheral faces is reduced. Our results indicate that the presence of clutter changes the response of the face-selective network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Timing-Dependent Potentiation and Depression of Electrical Synapses Contribute to Network Stability in the Crustacean Cardiac Ganglion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Central pattern generators produce many rhythms necessary for survival (e.g., chewing, breathing, locomotion), and doing so often requires coordination of neurons through electrical synapses. Because even neurons of the same type within a network are often differentially tuned, uniformly applied neuromodulators or toxins can result in uncoordinated activity. In the crab (<I>Cancer borealis</I>) cardiac ganglion, potassium channel blockers and serotonin cause increased depolarization of the five electrically coupled motor neurons as well as loss of the normally completely synchronous activity. Given time, compensation occurs that restores excitability and synchrony. One of the underlying mechanisms of this compensation is an increase in coupling among neurons. However, the salient physiological signal that initiates increased coupling has not been determined. Using male <I>C. borealis</I>, we show that it is the loss of synchronous voltage signals between coupled neurons that is at least partly responsible for plasticity in coupling. Shorter offsets in naturalistic activity across a gap junction enhance coupling, whereas longer delays depress coupling. We also provide evidence on why a desynchronization-specific potentiation or depression of the synapse could ultimately be adaptive through using a hybrid network created by artificially coupling two cardiac ganglia. Specifically, a stray neuron may be brought back in line by increasing coupling if its activity is closer to the remainder of the network. However, if a the activity of a neuron is far outside network parameters, it is detrimental to increase coupling, and therefore depression of the synapse removes a potentially harmful influence on the network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding how neural networks maintain output over years despite environmental and physiological challenges requires understanding the regulatory principles of these networks. Here, we study how cells that are synchronously active at baseline respond to becoming desynchronized. In this system, a loss of synchrony causes different parts of the heart to receive uncoordinated stimulation. We find a calcium-dependent control mechanism that alters the strength of electrical connections between motor neurons. Although others have described similar control mechanisms, here, we demonstrate that voltage changes are sufficient to elicit regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong connections in a sufficiently perturbed network can prevent any neuron from producing its target activity, thus suggesting why the connections are not constitutively as strong as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structural Covariance and Heritability of the Optic Tract and Primary Visual Cortex in Living Human Brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individual differences among human brains exist at many scales, spanning gene expression, white matter tissue properties, and the size and shape of cortical areas. One notable example is an approximately 3-fold range in the size of human primary visual cortex (V1), a much larger range than is found in overall brain size. A previous study (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Andrews et al., 1997</cross-ref>) reported a correlation between optic tract (OT) cross-section area and V1 size in postmortem human brains, suggesting that there may be a common developmental mechanism for multiple components of the visual pathways. We evaluated the relationship between properties of the OT and V1 in a much larger sample of living human brains by analyzing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 7 Tesla Retinotopy Dataset (including 107 females and 71 males). This dataset includes retinotopic maps measured with functional MRI (fMRI) and fiber tract data measured with diffusion MRI (dMRI). We found a negative correlation between OT fractional anisotropy (FA) and V1 surface area (<I>r</I> = &ndash;0.19). This correlation, although small, was consistent across multiple dMRI datasets differing in acquisition parameters. Further, we found that both V1 surface area and OT properties were correlated among twins, with higher correlations for monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twins, indicating a high degree of heritability for both properties. Together, these results demonstrate covariation across individuals in properties of the retina (OT) and cortex (V1) and show that each is influenced by genetic factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The size of human primary visual cortex (V1) has large interindividual differences. These differences do not scale with overall brain size. A previous postmortem study reported a correlation between the size of the human optic tract (OT) and V1. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the OT and V1 in living humans by analyzing a neuroimaging dataset that included functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. We found a small, but robust correlation between OT tissue properties and V1 size, supporting the existence of structural covariance between the OT and V1 in living humans. The results suggest that characteristics of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), reflected in OT measurements, are correlated with individual differences in human V1.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">High-Definition Transcranial Stimulation over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Alters the Sunk Cost Effect: A Mental Accounting Framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sunk cost effect refers to the fact that human decisions are consistently influenced by previous irrecoverable and irrelevant costs. Recent neuroimaging experiments suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) plays a pivotal role in the sunk cost effect yet the causal and neurocomputational role of the dlPFC remains elusive. In this study, two cohorts of healthy human male and female adults were recruited to complete a novel two-step decision-making task during the anodal-sham or cathodal-sham high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the dlPFC, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, we showed that the sunk cost deterred participants from making further investment and therefore engendered a de-escalation effect. Such behavior can be captured by a weighted mental accounting model with a recalibrated reference point in which the direction and magnitude of the sunk cost effects hinge on the decision weights apportioned to the option values. Interestingly, transcranial stimulation did not influence participants' initial willingness to incur sunk costs but only altered sunk costs' downstream effects. Specifically, anodal stimulation over the right dlPFC amplified the de-escalation effect of sunk costs whereas cathodal stimulation yielded the opposite result. HD-tDCS also changed the decision weights of the mental accounting model, providing a causal and computational link between PFC and sunk cost effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traditional economic theory assumes that decisions only concern the marginal costs and benefits yet human choices are notoriously susceptible to previously-incurred costs (termed the sunk cost effect). In the current study, we showed that direct current stimulation (DCS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) altered sunk cost effects in participants' subsequent choices. Such effects can be captured by a mental accounting model where transcranial stimulation modulates the decision weights assigned to different options in the value integration process. These findings help elucidate the computational and causal role of the dlPFC in the context of sunk costs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Task-Dependent Warping of Semantic Representations during Search for Visual Action Categories</a></h4>

              
                <p>Object and action perception in cluttered dynamic natural scenes relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. It has been suggested that during visual search for objects, distributed semantic representation of hundreds of object categories is warped to expand the representation of targets. Yet, little is known about whether and where in the brain visual search for action categories modulates semantic representations. To address this fundamental question, we studied brain activity recorded from five subjects (one female) via functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed natural movies and searched for either communication or locomotion actions. We find that attention directed to action categories elicits tuning shifts that warp semantic representations broadly across neocortex and that these shifts interact with intrinsic selectivity of cortical voxels for target actions. These results suggest that attention serves to facilitate task performance during social interactions by dynamically shifting semantic selectivity toward target actions and that tuning shifts are a general feature of conceptual representations in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to swiftly perceive the actions and intentions of others is a crucial skill for humans that relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. However, little is known about the nature of high-level semantic representations during natural visual search for action categories. Here, we provide the first evidence showing that attention significantly warps semantic representations by inducing tuning shifts in single cortical voxels, broadly spread across occipitotemporal, parietal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices. This dynamic attentional mechanism can facilitate action perception by efficiently allocating neural resources to accentuate the representation of task-relevant action categories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding the Specificity of Post-Error Adjustments Using EEG-Based Multivariate Pattern Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Errors can elicit post-error adjustments that serve to optimize performance by preventing further errors. An essential but unsolved issue is that whether post-error adjustments are domain-general or domain-specific, which was investigated in the present study through eliciting different types of errors. Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded when male and female subjects performed the Eriksen flanker task. For this study, we examined the aforementioned issue by combining event-related potential and multivariate pattern analysis. The results indicated that post-error slowing, error-related negativity, and error positivity were comparable between congruent and incongruent errors, indicating that errors triggered domain-general interference mechanisms, whereas post-error accuracy and late positive potential elicited by incongruent errors were larger than those elicited by congruent errors, exhibiting domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms. Importantly, no successful decoding soon after errors was found between congruent and incongruent errors, but above-chance decoding was observed between these two types of errors with increasing time, which further support that domain-general adjustments occurred in the early stage, whereas domain-specific adjustments appeared in the late stage. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation results suggested that the late post-error adjustments predicted subsequent behavior performance. Together, this study revealed that early domain-general interference adjustments induced by errors are reflected in error detection and error awareness, which are independent of error types; on the contrary, late domain-specific control adjustments are reflected in attentional adjustments, which are modulated by error types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To date, clear evidence on the specificity of post-error adjustments is lacking. The present study provides neurophysiological evidence that post-error adjustments simultaneously rely on both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms. Event-related potential results indicated that domain-general adjustments were accompanied by the interference of error detection and error awareness. In contrast, domain-specific adjustments were associated with attentional adjustments. Multivariate pattern analysis further decoded the two features of post-error adjustments in the early stage matching the time patterns of error-related negativity and error positivity and in the late stage corresponding to the late positive potential. Temporal generalization analysis showed that domain-specific processing appeared stably in late post-error adjustments. Hence, we propose that post-error different stages may determine the specificity of post-error adjustments.</p>

                <p>The complex pathophysiology of post-traumatic brain damage might need a polypharmacological strategy with a combination of drugs that target multiple, synergistic mechanisms. We currently tested a combination of apocynin (curtails formation of reactive oxygen species), tert-butylhydroquinone (promotes disposal of reactive oxygen species), and salubrinal (prevents endoplasmic reticulum stress) following a moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact in adult mice. Adult mice of both sexes treated with the above tri-combo showed alleviated motor and cognitive deficits, attenuated secondary lesion volume, and decreased oxidative DNA damage. Concomitantly, tri-combo treatment regulated post-TBI inflammatory response by decreasing the infiltration of T cells and neutrophils and activation of microglia in both sexes. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism was seen in the case of TBI-induced microgliosis and infiltration of macrophages in the tri-combo&ndash;treated mice. Moreover, the tri-combo treatment prevented TBI-induced white matter volume loss in both sexes. The beneficial effects of tri-combo treatment were long-lasting and were also seen in aged mice. Thus, the present study supports the tri-combo treatment to curtail oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress concomitantly as a therapeutic strategy to improve TBI outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Of the several mechanisms that contribute to TBI pathophysiology, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inflammation play a major role. The present study shows the therapeutic potential of a combination of apocynin, tert-butylhydroquinone, and salubrinal to prevent oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and the interrelated inflammatory response in mice subjected to TBI. The beneficial effects of the tri-combo include alleviation of TBI-induced motor and cognitive deficits and lesion volume. The neuroprotective effects of the tri-combo are also linked to its ability to prevent TBI-induced white matter damage. Importantly, neuroprotection by the tri-combo treatment was observed to be not dependent on sex or age. Our data demonstrate that a polypharmacological strategy is efficacious after TBI.</p>

                Background: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of patients who have developed acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has soared rapidly, cardiovascular disease and mortality are influenced by the elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this study is to compare inflammatory markers between patients with ACS who hadn’t previously had COVID-19 and those who’d be infected within the preceding three months; as well as, evaluating the effect of statins on inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: This is a comparative cross-sectional study of 42 patients who presented with ACS and had previously had COVID-19 and 48 patient who had never had COVID-19, who were admitted to the coronary care unit at the Iraqi Center for Heart Disease and Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Iraq. Inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6, and HS-CRP) levels were determined in serum samples of all patients at admission to these centers then one month later, after administration of statins daily using the Sandwich-ELISA Principle, and Immunofluorescence technique for these markers. Result: The baseline for patients who had ACS and COVID-19 three months previously, were IL6 (85.87 ±45.80), HS-CRP (23.19 ± 14.49), and TNF-α (161.94± 240.96) were higher than patients that had ACS but not COVID-19; IL6 (50.77±22.48), HS-CRP (13.64± 12.09), and TNF-α (117.73 ±71.23),(p<0.0001), (p=0.003) and (p=0.201) for IL6, HS-CRP, and TNF-α respectively. Rosuvastatin showed a significant reduction in HS-CRP and IL6 (P<0.001), while Atorvastatin a significant reduction in HS-CRP (P<0.001) after one month of therapy. Yet there was no significant difference in the level of TNF α in these two groups at the end of this study.     Conclusions: The patients with previous COVID-19 still had higher inflammatory markers than those who didn’t. Rosuvastatin 40mg had a more reduction in IL6 than Atorvastatin 40mg after one month and both of them could reduce HS-CRP, but neither could reduce TNF-α in this short period.

     alt="Quantification of CGRP-immunoreactive myenteric neurons in mouse colon"/><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a putative marker of multiaxonal, intrinsic primary afferent neurons in mouse colon. This study quantifies the proportion of myenteric nerve cell bodies along the mouse colon that are immunoreactive to CGRP.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Quantitative data of biological systems provide valuable baseline information for understanding pathology, experimental perturbations, and computational modeling. In mouse colon, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is expressed by myenteric neurons with multiaxonal (Dogiel type II) morphology, characteristic of intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs). Analogous neurons in other species and gut regions represent 5–35% of myenteric neurons. We aimed to quantify proportions of CGRP-immunopositive (CGRP+) myenteric neurons. Colchicine-treated wholemount preparations of proximal, mid, and distal colon were labeled for HuC/D, CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and peripherin (Per). The pan-neuronal markers (Hu+/Per+) co-labeled 94% of neurons. Hu+/Per– neurons comprised ∼6%, but Hu-/Per+ cells were rare. Thus, quantification was based on Hu+ myenteric neurons (8576 total; 1225 ± 239 per animal, <i>n</i> = 7). CGRP+ cell bodies were significantly larger than the average of all Hu+ neurons (329 ± 13 vs. 261 ± 12 μm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001). CGRP+ neurons comprised 19% ± 3% of myenteric neurons without significant regional variation. NOS+ neurons comprised 42% ± 2% of myenteric neurons overall, representing a lower proportion in proximal colon, compared to mid and distal colon (38% ± 2%, 44% ± 2%, and 44% ± 3%, respectively). Peripherin immunolabeling revealed cell body and axonal morphology in some myenteric neurons. Whether all CGRP+ neurons were multiaxonal could not be addressed using peripherin immunolabeling. However, of 118 putatively multiaxonal neurons first identified based on peripherin immunoreactivity, all were CGRP+ (<i>n</i> = 4). In conclusion, CGRP+ myenteric neurons in mouse colon were comprehensively quantified, occurring within a range expected of a putative IPAN marker. All Per+ multiaxonal neurons, characteristic of Dogiel type II/IPAN morphology, were CGRP+.</p>

                Primary cardiac tumors (PCTs) are extremely rare entities. More than half of PCTs are benign, with myxoma being the most common tumor. Generally, simple tumor resection is the treatment of choice for benign PCTs since it has promising results that yield low complication and recurrence rates. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic era, the mitigation protocols and/or concurrent COVID-19 infection should be taken into account in patient management for the best overall outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with a left atrial myxoma and systemic embolism complication in the form of an ischemic stroke, with a concurrent confirmed COVID-19 delta variant infection.

                Recent allostatic–interoceptive explanations using predictive coding models propose that efficient regulation of the body’s internal milieu is necessary to correctly anticipate environmental needs. We review this framework applied to understanding behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) considering both allostatic overload and interoceptive deficits. First, we show how this framework could explain divergent deficits in bvFTD (cognitive impairments, behavioral maladjustment, brain atrophy, fronto-insular-temporal network atypicality, aberrant interoceptive electrophysiological activity, and autonomic disbalance).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse states and stimuli tune olfactory receptor expression levels to modulate food-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must weigh competing needs and states to generate adaptive behavioral responses to the environment. Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which external sensory information and internal nutritional state are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which sensory and state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal’s overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which sensory- and state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals’ sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of sequence determinants of enhancer function using natural genetic variation</a></h4>

              
                Sequence variation in enhancers that control cell type-specific gene transcription contributes significantly to phenotypic variation within human populations. However, it remains difficult to predict precisely the effect of any given sequence variant on enhancer function due to the complexity of DNA sequence motifs that determine transcription factor (TF) binding to enhancers in their native genomic context. Using F<sub>1</sub>-hybrid cells derived from crosses between distantly related inbred strains of mice, we identified thousands of enhancers with allele-specific TF binding and/or activity. We find that genetic variants located within the central region of enhancers are most likely to alter TF binding and enhancer activity. We observe that the AP-1 family of TFs (Fos/Jun) are frequently required for binding of TEAD TFs and for enhancer function. However, many sequence variants outside of core motifs for AP-1 and TEAD also impact enhancer function, including sequences flanking core TF motifs and AP-1 half sites. Taken together, these data represent one of the most comprehensive assessments of allele-specific TF binding and enhancer function to date and reveal how sequence changes at enhancers alter their function across evolutionary timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Arabidopsis SAC9 enzyme is enriched in a cortical population of early endosomes and restricts PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                Membrane lipids, and especially phosphoinositides, are differentially enriched within the eukaryotic endomembrane system. This generates a landmark code by modulating the properties of each membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] specifically accumulates at the plasma membrane in yeast, animal, and plant cells, where it regulates a wide range of cellular processes including endocytic trafficking. However, the functional consequences of mispatterning PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in plants are unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the putative phosphoinositide phosphatase <i>SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9</i> (SAC9) in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<i>Arabidopsis</i>). We found that SAC9 depletion led to the ectopic localization of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on cortical intracellular compartments, which depends on PI4P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production at the plasma membrane. SAC9 localizes to a subpopulation of <i>trans</i>-Golgi Network/early endosomes that are enriched in a region close to the cell cortex and that are coated with clathrin. Furthermore, it interacts and colocalizes with Src Homology 3 Domain Protein 2 (SH3P2), a protein involved in endocytic trafficking. In the absence of SAC9, SH3P2 localization is altered and the clathrin-mediated endocytosis rate is reduced. Together, our results highlight the importance of restricting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and illustrate that one of the consequences of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> misspatterning in plants is to impact the endocytic trafficking.

                Omics-based technologies are driving major advances in precision medicine, but efforts are still required to consolidate their use in drug discovery. In this work, we exemplify the use of multi-omics to support the development of 3-chloropiperidines, a new class of candidate anticancer agents. Combined analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility elucidated the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to test agents. Furthermore, we implemented a new versatile strategy for the integration of RNA- and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) data, able to accelerate and extend the standalone analyses of distinct omic layers. This platform guided the construction of a perturbation-informed basal signature predicting cancer cell lines’ sensitivity and to further direct compound development against specific tumor types. Overall, this approach offers a scalable pipeline to support the early phases of drug discovery, understanding of mechanisms, and potentially inform the positioning of therapeutics in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human WDR5 promotes breast cancer growth and metastasis via KMT2-independent translation regulation</a></h4>

              
                Metastatic breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer related deaths in women and there are few effective therapies against this advanced disease. Emerging evidence suggests that key steps of tumor progression and metastasis are controlled by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. Using an <i>in vivo</i> genetic screen, we identified WDR5 as an actionable epigenetic regulator that is required for metastatic progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer. We found that knockdown of WDR5 in breast cancer cells independently impaired their tumorigenic as well as metastatic capabilities. Mechanistically, WDR5 promotes cell growth by increasing ribosomal gene expression and translation efficiency in a KMT2-independent manner. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition or degradation of WDR5 impedes cellular translation rate and the clonogenic ability of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, combination of WDR5-targeting with mTOR inhibitors leads to potent suppression of translation and proliferation of breast cancer cells. These results reveal novel therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions</a></h4>

              
                Facial affect is expressed dynamically - a giggle, grimace, or an agitated frown. However, the characterization of human affect has relied almost exclusively on static images. This approach cannot capture the nuances of human communication or support the naturalistic assessment of affective disorders. Using the latest in machine vision and systems modelling, we studied dynamic facial expressions of people viewing emotionally salient film clips. We found that the apparent complexity of dynamic facial expressions can be captured by a small number of simple spatiotemporal states - composites of distinct facial actions, each expressed with a unique spectral fingerprint. Sequential expression of these states is common across individuals viewing the same film stimuli but varies in those with the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder. This approach provides a platform for translational research, capturing dynamic facial expressions under naturalistic conditions and enabling new quantitative tools for the study of affective disorders and related mental illnesses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Embryonic cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons form an active, transient circuit motif perturbed by autism-associated mutations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits are composed predominantly of pyramidal-to-pyramidal neuron connections, yet their assembly during embryonic development is not well understood. We show that embryonic layer 5 pyramidal neurons, identified through single cell transcriptomics, display two phases of circuit assembly in vivo. At E14.5, a multi-layered circuit motif, composed of a single layer 5 cell type, forms. This motif is transient, switching to a second circuit motif, involving all three types, by E17.5. In vivo targeted single cell recordings and two-photon calcium imaging of embryonic layer 5 neurons reveal that, in both phases, neurons have active somas and neurites, tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated conductances, and functional glutamatergic synapses. Embryonic layer 5 neurons strongly express autism-associated genes, and perturbing these genes disrupts the switch between the two motifs. Hence, layer 5 pyramidal neurons form transient active pyramidal-to-pyramidal circuits, at the inception of neocortex, and studying these circuits could yield insights into the etiology of autism.

                Memories of past events can be recalled long after the event, indicating stability. But new experiences are also integrated into existing memories, indicating plasticity. In the hippocampus, spatial representations are known to remain stable, but have also been shown to drift over long periods of time. We hypothesized that experience, more than the passage of time, is the driving force behind memory plasticity. We compared the stability of place cells in the hippocampus of mice traversing two similar, familiar tracks for different durations. We found that the more time spent in an environment, the greater the representational drift, regardless of the total elapsed time. Our results suggest that spatial representation is a dynamic process, related to the ongoing experiences within a specific context, and is related to the accumulation of new memories rather than to passive forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lack of the glycine alpha 2 receptor impairs reward-motivated behavior and striatal signal integration.</a></h4>

              
                Distinct developmental pathologies, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, exhibit impaired reward-motivated behavior. Key to proper reward-motivated behavior is the integration of dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs to the striatum. The glycine alpha 2 receptor (GlyR2) is the single functionally expressed glycine receptor in adult striatum, and is therefore ideally positioned to modulate striatal behavior and cellular signal integration. Here, we report excessive appetitive conditioning in GlyR2 knockout animals. We next show that depletion of GlyR2 enhances dopamine-induced increases in the activity of putative dopamine D1-expressing striatal projection neurons, while not affecting dopamine neuron activity. These in vivo behavioral changes are tied to enhanced striatal activation in GlyR2 KO mice, since we found excessive locomotor responses to amphetamine in GlyR2 KO mice that correlate with immediate early gene c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum. 3-D modeling revealed activation of cell ensembles in the striatum in response to D-amphetamine, an increase in number of cells but no shift in intercell distance histograms, in agreement with unaltered dopamine release, in GlyR2 KO mice. Taken together, we show that depletion of GlyR2 impairs reward-motivated behavior and altered striatal signal integration. This sheds important light onto the cellular mechanisms that underlie reward function, and pave the way towards novel therapeutics for the treatment of e.g. schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A slow 5-HT1AR-mediated recurrent inhibitory network in raphe computes contextual value through synaptic facilitation</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a diverse constellation of long-range synaptic inputs, yet unifying principles of local circuitry and its dynamics are largely unknown - a crucial component of understanding how 5-HT output controls behavior. Here, we developed a formalism bridging optogenetic, electrophysiological, computational and behavioral strategies to reveal how the dynamics of local circuitry in DRN control the expression of reward associations. Using long-range input from lateral habenula (LHb) to interrogate functional DRN circuitry, we uncover 5-HT1A receptor-mediated local recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition by 5-HT1A receptors. These inhibitory 5-HT connections were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating, and gated spike output of 5-HT neurons. Targeted physiology and modeling approaches revealed that these functional connectivity features collectively support the emergence of a paradoxical excitation-driven inhibition in response to high frequency LHb activation, and of a winner-take-all computation over protracted timescales. In vivo, we found that optogenetic activation of LHb inputs to DRN transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task. In accordance with quantitative model predictions, this disruption occurred exclusively at the conjunction of high frequency LHb activation and high predicted reward value, and was not due to a modulation of the underlying reward association. Thus, we propose that recurrent dynamics in the DRN support a contextual value computation, where stable learned associations are integrated with dynamic environmental inputs to support sharp behavioral state transitions in changing environments.

                Anosmia was identified as a hallmark of COVID-19 early in the pandemic, however, with the emergence of variants of concern, the clinical profile induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection has changed, with anosmia being less frequent. Several studies have focused on the neuropathogenesis of the original SARS-CoV-2, but little is known about the neuropathological potential of the variants. Here, we assessed the clinical, olfactory and inflammatory conditions of golden hamsters infected with the original SARS-CoV-2, its ORF7-deleted mutant, and three variants: Gamma, Delta and Omicron/BA.1. We show that infected animals developed a variant-dependent clinical disease, and that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to causing olfactory disturbances. Conversely, all SARS-CoV-2 variants were found to be neuroinvasive, regardless of the clinical presentation they induce. With newly-generated nanoluciferase-expressing SARS-CoV-2, we validated the olfactory pathway as a main entry point towards the brain, confirming that neuroinvasion and anosmia are independent phenomena upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

                Synapses from the same axon onto the same dendrite have a common history of coactivation and have similar spine head volumes, suggesting that synapse function precisely modulates structure. We have applied Shannon information theory to obtain a new analysis of synaptic information storage capacity (SISC) using non-overlapping dimensions of dendritic spine head volumes as a measure of synaptic weights with distinct states. Spine head volumes in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1 occupied 24 distinct states (4.1 bits). In contrast, spine head volumes in the middle molecular layer of control dentate gyrus occupied only 5 distinct states (2 bits). Thus, synapses in different hippocampal regions had different synaptic information storage capacities. Moreover, these were not fixed properties but increased during long-term potentiation, such that by 30 min following induction, spine head volumes in the middle molecular layer increased to occupy 10 distinct states (3 bits), and this increase lasted for at least 2 hours. Measurement of the Kullback-Liebler divergence revealed that synaptic states evolved closer to storing the maximum amount of information during long-term potentiation. These results show that our new SISC analysis provides an improved and reliable estimate of information storage capacity of synapses. SISC revealed that the Shannon information after long-term potentiation is nearly maximized for the number of distinguishable states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Parcellation Scheme of Mouse Isocortex Based on Reversals in Connectivity Gradients</a></h4>

              
                The brain comprises several anatomically clearly separated structures. This parcellation is often extended into the isocortex, where border demarcations are less clear due to its relatively homogeneous structure. Yet, established parcellation schemes exist, based on anatomical, physiological or functional differences. Here, we derive a parcellation scheme based purely on connectomics, that is, the spatial structure of long-range synaptic connections within the cortex. To that end, we analyze a publicly available dataset of average mouse brain connectivity, and split the isocortex into disjunct regions. Instead of clustering connectivity based on similarity or modularity, our scheme is inspired by methods that split sensory cortices into subregions where gradients of neuronal response properties, such as the location of the receptive field, reverse. We developed a method to calculate comparable gradients from voxelized brain connectivity data and automatically detect reversals in them. This approach better respects the known presence of functional gradients within brain regions than clustering-based approaches. Placing borders at the reversals resulted in a parcellation into 41 subregions that differs significantly from an established scheme in nonrandom ways, but is comparable in terms of the modularity of connectivity between regions. It revealed unexpected trends of connectivity, such a a tripartite split of somatomotor regions along an anterior to posterior gradient. The method can be readily adapted to other organisms and data sources, such as human functional connectivity.

                The responsiveness of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to physical tactile stimuli is well documented but the extent to which it is modulated by vision is unresolved. Additionally, recent literature has suggested that tactile events are represented in S1 in a more complex, generalized manner than its long-established topographic organization. To better characterize S1 function, neural activity was recorded from a tetraplegic patient implanted with microelectrode arrays in S1 during 1s stroking touches to the forearm (evoking numb sensation) or finger (naturalistic sensation). Touch conditions included visually observed first person physical touches, physical touches without vision, and visual touches without physical contact which occurred either to a third person, an inanimate object, or the patient's own body in virtual reality. Two major findings emerged from this dataset. The first was that vision strongly modulates S1 activity, but only if there is a physical element to the touch, suggesting that passive observation of touches is not sufficient to recruit S1 neurons. The second was that despite the location of the recording arrays in a putative arm area of S1, neural activity was able to represent both arm and finger touches in physical touch conditions. Arm touches were encoded more strongly and specifically, supporting the idea that S1 encodes tactile events primarily through its topographic organization, as well as in a more general manner encompassing larger areas of the body.

                In natural scenes, there is substantial variation in the mean and variance of light levels (luminance and contrast). Retinal ganglion cells maintain their sensitivity despite this variation and their limited signaling bandwidth using two adaptive mechanisms, which control luminance and contrast gain. However, the signature of each mechanism and their interactions further downstream of the retina are unknown. We recorded neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in anesthetized adult male macaques and characterized how they adapt to changes in contrast and luminance. As contrast increases, neurons in the magnocellular layers maintain sensitivity to high temporal frequency stimuli but attenuate sensitivity to low temporal-frequency stimuli. Neurons in the parvocellular layers do not adapt to changes in contrast. As luminance increases, magnocellular and parvocellular cells increase their sensitivity to high temporal frequency stimuli. Adaptation to luminance is independent of adaptation to contrast, as previously reported for LGN neurons in the cat. Our results are similar to those previously reported for macaque retinal ganglion cells, suggesting that adaptation to luminance and contrast result from two independent mechanisms that are retinal in origin.

                Widefield imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) is a promising approach for understanding the role of large cortical networks in the neural coding of behavior. However, the slow kinetics of current GEVIs limit their deployment for single-trial imaging of rapid neuronal voltage dynamics. Here, we developed a high-throughput platform to screen for GEVIs that combine fast kinetics with high brightness, sensitivity, and photostability under widefield one-photon illumination. Rounds of directed evolution produced JEDI-1P, a green-emitting fluorescent indicator whose performance is improved for all metrics. Next, we optimized a neonatal intracerebroventricular delivery method to achieve cost-effective and wide-spread JEDI-1P expression in mice. We also developed an approach to effectively correct optical measurements from hemodynamic and motion artifacts. Finally, we achieved stable brain-wide voltage imaging and successfully tracked gamma-frequency whisker and visual stimulations in awake mice in single trials, opening the door to investigating the role of high-frequency signals in brain computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking subject's strategies in behavioural choice experiments at trial resolution</a></h4>

              
                Investigating the strategies engaged by subjects in decision making and learning requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. Here we present a simple but effective probabilistic approach to tracking choice strategies at trial resolution, using Bayesian evidence accumulation. We show this approach identifies both successful learning and the exploratory strategies used in decision tasks performed by humans, non-human primates, rats, and synthetic agents. We find learning occurs earlier and more often than estimated using classical approaches. Also, win-stay and lose-shift strategies, often considered as complementary, are consistently used independently, with the adoption of lose-shift preceding both learning new rules and switching away from old rules. Our approach can be extended to any discrete choice strategy, and its low computational cost is ideally suited for real-time analysis and closed-loop control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Protein composition of axonal dopamine release sites in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms of neuromodulatory transmission in the brain remain ambiguous. Dopamine is a prototypical neuromodulator, and it was recently found that its secretion relies on active zone-like release site assemblies. Here, we use in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to isolate dopamine release site proteins enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content. Using three bait proteins, we identified 527 proteins that fall into several synaptic protein classes, including active zone, calcium regulatory and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with synaptic exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM profoundly disrupted dopamine release site composition assessed by iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. Alpha-synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinson's disease, was enriched at release sites, and this enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and we define the protein composition of these sites.

	<p>The cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a highly complex anatomical compartment consisting of numerous nervous and vascular structures that present mutual and intricate spatial relationships. CPA surgery represents, therefore, a constant challenge for neurosurgeons. Over the years, neurosurgeons have developed and refined several solutions with the aim of maximizing the surgical treatment effects while minimizing the invasiveness and risks for the patient. In this paper, we present our integrated approach to CPA surgery, describing its advantages in treating pathologies in this anatomical district. Our approach incorporates the use of technology, such as neuronavigation, along with advanced and multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) techniques, with the final goal of making this surgery safe and effective.</p>

	<p>Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is one of the least studied and understood developmental disorders. One area that has been minimally investigated in DCD is potential issues with sensory modulation. Further, in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) sensory modulation is related to many other challenges (e.g., social issues, repetitive behaviors, anxiety); however, such potential relationships in children with DCD have been largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is to explore sensory modulation differences in DCD and to understand the relationships between sensory modulation and social emotional measures, behavior, and motor skills in DCD in comparison to ASD and typically developing (TD) peers. Participants (aged 8&amp;amp;ndash;17) and their caregivers (DCD, N = 26; ASD, N = 57; and TD, N = 53) completed behavioral and clinical measures. The results indicated that 31% of the DCD group showed sensory modulation difficulties, with the DCD group falling between the ASD and TD groups. In the DCD group, sensory modulation was significantly associated with anxiety, empathic concern, repetitive behaviors, and motor skills. Data are compared to patterns seen in ASD and TD groups and implications for interventions are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background: Although there is increasing knowledge about adjustment disorder (AjD) based on the new diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), less is known on AjD in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of AjD and its risk factors in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Methods: The cross-sectional study sample comprised 1745 adolescents from Japan (n = 913) and Lithuania (n = 832). AjD was assessed using the Adjustment Disorder New Module-8 (ADNM-8). We compared the prevalence of AjD in Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. Using multinominal logistic regression analysis, we examined the effects of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and cumulative stressors as societal and cultural factors, resilience as an intrapersonal factor, and loneliness and perceived support as interpersonal factors on adolescent AjD. Results: The prevalence of probable AjD was 11.7% in Lithuanian adolescents and 6.9% in Japanese adolescents. Gender, socioeconomic status, cumulative stressors, resilience, loneliness, and perceived positive social support were each significantly associated with AjD risk. Conclusions: This cross-cultural comparative study revealed characteristics of the stressors and prevalence of AjD among Japanese and Lithuanian adolescents. In terms of the socio-interpersonal framework model for the stress&amp;amp;ndash;response syndrome, sociocultural, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors were found to be risk factors associated with AjD in adolescents.</p>

	<p>Glucose and platelet are two easily obtained clinical indicators; the present research aimed to demonstrate their association with hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients without thrombolytic or thrombectomy therapy. This was a single-center retrospective study. Patients who were diagnosed with HT after AIS were included in the HT group. Meanwhile, using the propensity score matching (PSM) approach, with a ratio of 1:2, matched patients without HT were included in the non-HT group. Serum G/P levels were measured on the first morning after admission (at least eight hours after the last meal). Characteristics were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the independent relationship between G/P and HT after AIS, with G/P being divided into quartiles. From January 2013 to March 2022, we consecutively included 643 AIS patients with HT (426/643 [66.25%] with HI and 217/643 [33.75%] with PH), and 1282 AIS patients without HT, at the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The HT group had higher G/P levels than the non-HT group (0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02 vs. 0.03 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, there was no difference in G/P levels between HI and PH subgroups (0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02 vs. 0.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.02, p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Moreover, the G/P levels were divided into quartiles (Q1 &amp;amp;le; 0.022; Q2 = 0.023&amp;amp;ndash;0.028; Q3 = 0.029&amp;amp;ndash;0.039; Q4 &amp;amp;ge; 0.040), with Q1 being settled as the reference layer. After controlling the confounders, multivariate regression analyses showed that the Q4 layer (Q4: G/P &amp;amp;ge; 0.040) was independently associated with elevated HT risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.31&amp;amp;ndash;2.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). G/P levels on admission were independently associated with HT risk in AIS patients. In clinical practice, adequate attention should be paid to AIS patients with elevated G/P levels (G/P &amp;amp;ge; 0.040).</p>

	<p>There are increasing reports that anticancer drugs, especially immunotherapy and specific targeted therapy, can cause uveitis, but it is not fully understood whether the clinical features of this drug-induced uveitis differ from those of other types of uveitis and whether there are differences between these drugs. We retrospectively reviewed the published cases and case series in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane from January 2011 to October 2020. We analysed the data, including patients&amp;amp;rsquo; basic information, medications used, duration of use, time to onset, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of uveitis. We focused on the differences in uveitis caused by immunotherapy and specific targeted therapy. Altogether 93 cases (43 men, 48 women, and 2 cases whose gender was not mentioned) reported in 55 articles were included in this study. The average age was 59.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.5 years. Eighty percent of the patients had bilateral involvement. Sixty cases were caused by immunotherapy (64.5%), and twenty-six were caused by specific targeted therapy (27.9%). No significant difference was found in the mean time from treatment to onset between the two groups. Anticancer drug-induced uveitis can involve all parts of the uvea from anterior to posterior, manifested as anterior chamber flare, anterior chamber cells, papillitis, macular oedema, subretinal fluid, and choroidal effusion. Anterior uveitis (24 cases, 40.0%) was more common in immunotherapy, and intermediate uveitis (8 cases, 30.8%) was more common in specific targeted therapy. The mean LogMAR visual acuity in specific targeted therapy at presentation was lower than in immunotherapy, but it was not statistically significant. Corticosteroid therapy can effectively control uveitis induced by anticancer drugs. However, the survival prognosis was poor. Among the 19 patients with reported cancer prognosis, seven (36.8%) had no cancer progression, eight (42.1%) had further metastases, and four (21.0%) died of cancer. In conclusion, uveitis caused by anticancer drugs involves both eyes and manifests as various types of uveitis. Patients with specific targeted therapy are more likely to have intermediate uveitis and low vision, and immunotherapy patients are more likely to have anterior uveitis. Corticosteroids are effective against uveitis caused by anticancer drugs.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Glioma is the most common primary tumor in the central nervous system, and glioma-related epilepsy (GRE) is one of its common symptoms. The abnormalities of white matter fiber tracts are involved in attributing changes in patients with epilepsy (Rud&amp;amp;agrave;, R, 2012).This study aimed to assess frontal lobe gliomas&amp;amp;rsquo; effects on the cerebral white matter fiber tracts. (2) Methods: Thirty patients with frontal lobe glioma were enrolled and divided into two groups (Ep and nEep). Among them, five patients were excluded due to apparent insular or temporal involvement. A set of 14 age and gender-matched healthy controls were also included. All the enrolled subjects underwent preoperative conventional magnetic resonance images (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, we used tract-based spatial statistics to analyze the characteristics of the white matter fiber tracts. (3) Results: The two patient groups showed similar patterns of mean diffusivity (MD) elevations in most regions; however, in the ipsilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and superior corona radiata, the significant voxels of the EP group were more apparent than in the nEP group. No significant fractional anisotropy (FA) elevations or MD degenerations were found in the current study. (4) Conclusions: Gliomas grow and invade along white matter fiber tracts. This study assessed the effects of GRE on the white matter fiber bundle skeleton by TBSS, and we found that the changes in the white matter skeleton of the frontal lobe tumor-related epilepsy were mainly concentrated in the IFOF, SLF, and superior corona radiata. This reveals that GRE significantly affects the white matter fiber microstructure of the tumor.</p>

	<p>Early childhood maltreatment and other traumatic event experiences (&amp;amp;ldquo;trauma&amp;amp;rdquo;) are common among youth, including those with substance use problems including substance use disorders (SUD). Particularly, interpersonal violence is associated with high rates of comorbidity between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and SUD, and these comorbid disorders exhibit high levels of overlapping symptomatology. Theoretical models proposed to explain the bidirectional relationship between PTSD and SUD include the self-medication hypothesis and susceptibility hypothesis. In this article, we explore neurobiologic changes associated with trauma, PTSD, and SUD that underly dysregulated stress response. Examining lessons learned from recent translational and clinical research, we propose that further elucidating the neurobiologic etiology of comorbid PTSD and SUD will require a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, including the integration of preclinical and clinical studies, exploration of biologic markers in clinical studies, and accumulation of larger studies and longitudinal studies with the power to study PTSD and SUD. Such research can transform the field and ultimately reduce high rates and costly impairment of co-occurring PTSD and SUD across the lifespan.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Variation in TAF1 Expression in Female Carrier-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Human Brain Ontogeny Has Implications for Adult Neostriatum Vulnerability in X-Linked Dystonia Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function. A disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of <I>TAF1</I>, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) status and identified clonal lines that express either the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that <I>TAF1</I> is decreased in most female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, <I>TAF1</I> expression is not sexually dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that regional-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific mechanisms regulate <I>TAF1</I>, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the decreased <I>TAF1</I> expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the XDP-specific partial loss of <I>TAF1</I> function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of <I>TAF1</I> function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Uncovering the Locus of Object-Context-Based Modulations in Depth Processing Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural responses of dorsal visual area V7 and lateral occipital complex (LOC) have been shown to correlate with changes in behavioral metrics of depth sensitivity observed as a function of object context, although it is unclear as to whether the behavioral manifestation results from an alteration of early depth-specific responses in V7 or arises as a result of alterations of object-level representations at LOC that subsequently feed back to affect disparity readouts in dorsal cortex. Here, we used online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the roles of these two areas in giving rise to context&ndash;disparity interactions. Stimuli were disparity-defined geometric objects rendered as random-dot stereograms, presented in geometrically plausible and implausible variations. Observers&rsquo; sensitivity to depth (depth discrimination) or object identity (plausibility discrimination) was indexed while receiving repetitive TMS at one of the two sites of interest (V7, LOC) along with a control site (Cz). TMS over LOC produced results no different from TMS over baseline Cz (and prior no-TMS behavioral work). That is, depth sensitivity was higher for implausible versus plausible objects. Strikingly, TMS over V7 abolished differences in depth sensitivity for implausible versus plausible objects. V7 serves as a key locus in bringing stereosensitivity changes because of object context, perhaps by reweighing stereoscopic data en route to informing object&ndash;motoric interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What is the nature of motor adaptation to dynamic perturbations?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Etienne Moullet, Agnès Roby-Brami, Emmanuel Guigon</p>

When human participants repeatedly encounter a velocity-dependent force field that distorts their movement trajectories, they adapt their motor behavior to recover straight trajectories. Computational models suggest that adaptation to a force field occurs at the action selection level through changes in the mapping between goals and actions. The quantitative prediction from these models indicates that early perturbed trajectories before adaptation and late unperturbed trajectories after adaptation should have opposite curvature, i.e. one being a mirror image of the other. We tested these predictions in a human adaptation experiment and we found that the expected mirror organization was either absent or much weaker than predicted by the models. These results are incompatible with adaptation occurring at the action selection level but compatible with adaptation occurring at the goal selection level, as if adaptation corresponds to aiming toward spatially remapped targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Reconstructing the course of the COVID-19 epidemic over 2020 for US states and counties: Results of a Bayesian evidence synthesis model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie H. Chitwood, Marcus Russi, Kenneth Gunasekera, Joshua Havumaki, Fayette Klaassen, Virginia E. Pitzer, Joshua A. Salomon, Nicole A. Swartwood, Joshua L. Warren, Daniel M. Weinberger, Ted Cohen, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Reported COVID-19 cases and deaths provide a delayed and incomplete picture of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States (US). Accurate estimates of both the timing and magnitude of infections are needed to characterize viral transmission dynamics and better understand COVID-19 disease burden. We estimated time trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and other COVID-19 outcomes for every county in the US, from the first reported COVID-19 case in January 13, 2020 through January 1, 2021. To do so we employed a Bayesian modeling approach that explicitly accounts for reporting delays and variation in case ascertainment, and generates daily estimates of incident SARS-CoV-2 infections on the basis of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. The model is freely available as the <i>covidestim</i> R package. Nationally, we estimated there had been 49 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 404,214 COVID-19 deaths by the end of 2020, and that 28% of the US population had been infected. There was county-level variability in the timing and magnitude of incidence, with local epidemiological trends differing substantially from state or regional averages, leading to large differences in the estimated proportion of the population infected by the end of 2020. Our estimates of true COVID-19 related deaths are consistent with independent estimates of excess mortality, and our estimated trends in cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are consistent with trends in seroprevalence estimates from available antibody testing studies. Reconstructing the underlying incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections across US counties allows for a more granular understanding of disease trends and the potential impact of epidemiological drivers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">WhichTF is functionally important in your open chromatin data?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yosuke Tanigawa, Ethan S. Dyer, Gill Bejerano</p>

We present WhichTF, a computational method to identify functionally important transcription factors (TFs) from chromatin accessibility measurements. To rank TFs, WhichTF applies an ontology-guided functional approach to compute novel enrichment by integrating accessibility measurements, high-confidence pre-computed conservation-aware TF binding sites, and putative gene-regulatory models. Comparison with prior sheer abundance-based methods reveals the unique ability of WhichTF to identify context-specific TFs with functional relevance, including NF-κB family members in lymphocytes and GATA factors in cardiac cells. To distinguish the transcriptional regulatory landscape in closely related samples, we apply differential analysis and demonstrate its utility in lymphocyte, mesoderm developmental, and disease cells. We find suggestive, under-characterized TFs, such as RUNX3 in mesoderm development and GLI1 in systemic lupus erythematosus. We also find TFs known for stress response, suggesting routine experimental caveats that warrant careful consideration. WhichTF yields biological insight into known and novel molecular mechanisms of TF-mediated transcriptional regulation in diverse contexts, including human and mouse cell types, cell fate trajectories, and disease-associated cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of differences and commonalities in wildlife hunting across the Africa-Europe South-North gradient</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mona Estrella Bachmann, Lars Kulik, Tsegaye Gatiso, Martin Reinhardt Nielsen, Dagmar Haase, Marco Heurich, Ana Buchadas, Lukas Bösch, Dustin Eirdosh, Andreas Freytag, Jonas Geldmann, Arash Ghoddousi, Thurston Cleveland Hicks, Isabel Ordaz-Németh, Siyu Qin, Tenekwetche Sop, Suzanne van Beeck Calkoen, Karsten Wesche, Hjalmar S. Kühl</p>

Hunting and its impacts on wildlife are typically studied regionally, with a particular focus on the Global South. Hunting can, however, also undermine rewilding efforts or threaten wildlife in the Global North. Little is known about how hunting manifests under varying socioeconomic and ecological contexts across the Global South and North. Herein, we examined differences and commonalities in hunting characteristics across an exemplary Global South-North gradient approximated by the Human Development Index (HDI) using face-to-face interviews with 114 protected area (PA) managers in 25 African and European countries. Generally, we observed that hunting ranges from the illegal, economically motivated, and unsustainable hunting of herbivores in the South to the legal, socially and ecologically motivated hunting of ungulates within parks and the illegal hunting of mainly predators outside parks in the North. Commonalities across this Africa-Europe South-North gradient included increased conflict-related killings in human-dominated landscapes and decreased illegal hunting with beneficial community conditions, such as mutual trust resulting from community involvement in PA management. Nevertheless, local conditions cannot outweigh the strong effect of the HDI on unsustainable hunting. Our findings highlight regional challenges that require collaborative, integrative efforts in wildlife conservation across actors, while identified commonalities may outline universal mechanisms for achieving this goal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Variations in sexual network connectivity may explain dramatic variations in sexually transmitted infection prevalence between populations and over time: a selected four-country analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been noted to vary dramatically between population groups and over time. Here, the hypothesis that changes in network connectivity underpin these changes is explored. Methods: The incidence/prevalence estimates of HIV, herpes simplex virus-2, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, as well as two markers of sexual network connectivity (partner concurrency and multiple partnering) by ethnic group and sexual orientation in Kenya, South Africa, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA) were extracted from published studies. Pearson’s correlation was used to test the association between the markers of network connectivity and the incidence/prevalence of these five STIs. A literature review was performed to evaluate the possible causes of the increases and decreases in syphilis incidence over the past 60 years. Results: In each country, the five STIs were found to cluster in particular ethnic groups and sexual orientations and to be positively associated with the two markers of network connectivity. Syphilis incidence in the UK and USA was found to increase dramatically in the 1960s/1970s, decline in the 1980s and again increase in the late 1990s. These changes took place predominantly in men who have sex with men, and were preceded by corresponding changes in network connectivity. The large decline in antenatal syphilis prevalence in Kenya and South Africa in the 1990s were likewise preceded by declines in network connectivity. Conclusions: Although other explanatory variables are not controlled for, the present analysis is compatible with the hypothesis that differential network connectivity is a parsimonious explanation for variations in STI incidence over time and between populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Records of antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to COVID-19: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby's immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes toward and knowledge of collaboration of dental and medical practice among medical students in Southern India: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:    Enhancing oral health care services provided through inter-professional collaboration between medical and dental practitioner is important, and even essential. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice among medical students attending colleges in Southern India. Methods:       A cross sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among medical students and interns of medical colleges in coastal South India with prior information and permission. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions to assess attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice. The demographic backgrounds of participants were also recorded. Chi square test was employed for data analysis. The responses obtained were correlated with age, gender and year of study of participants using Pearson’s correlation test Results:        A total 250 questionnaires were distributed and 234 responses were appropriately completed. Most of the students agreed that oral health was an integral part of systemic health, however participants disagreed on attending compulsory rotation in dentistry at a statistically significant level (p<0.05), moreover participants did not agree with physicians having an active role in motivating their patients for regular dental check-up. 82% of the medical students believe that dental check-up should be included in health packages under health insurance. A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was observed among 3 rd year & 4 th year students and interns and also it was found that female students provided more positive responses towards medical-dental collaboration. Conclusions:        Even though medical students showed fairly positive attitudes and knowledge towards dentistry, the analysis within the study groups showed that knowledge and attitudes regarding the collaborative practice worsened over the academic years among the medical students. In order to destigmatize and foster interprofessional collaboration which would contribute to higher resource efficiency and the standard of care, continuing education in both the disciplines would be highly beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elevated shock index and modified shock index are associated with mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied extensively to predict unfavourable outcomes in patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Shock index (SI) and modified shock index (MSI) are two new emerging parameters that incorporate BP and HR into their calculations, thereby improving the predictive value of each HR and BP alone in AMI patients. Thus, our aim was to determine the prognostic utility of SI and MSI in AMI patients. Methods We searched PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO Host, and Europe PMC from conception to May 2022. Studies were eligible if they evaluated the relationship of SI and MSI with all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events. Results A total of 16 studies involving 80,195 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Our study revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality risk for patients with high SI and MSI compared to patients with low indices, regardless of the periods of outcomes, study population, or diverse cut-off values. Moreover, both increased SI and MSI also predicted higher major adverse cardiac event rates. Conclusions According to our findings, both SI and MSI in the emergency department can predict all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given this growing body of evidence, as well as the fact that SI and MSI are very simple objective indices derived from two readily available vital signs, they should be used in daily clinical practice to risk stratify patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

                How lncRNA-Lsd1 interplay affects cell differentiation remains unclear in vivo. Shao et al. identify three long hairpin RNAs as Lsd1-interacting non-coding RNAs (LINRs). LINRs function to support fly egg production. At the cellular level, LINR-2 modulates Lsd1 function to regulate cell-specific differentiation of GSCs and follicle progenitors during fly oogenesis.

This uncoupling is due to LIMK-mediated cofilin inactivation, which reduces both actin turnover and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) recruitment to synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Memory trace imbalance in reinforcement and punishment systems can reinforce implicit choices leading to obsessive-compulsive behavior</a></h4>

              
                Sakai et al. show that imbalanced learning between reinforcement and punishment can induce obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A computational model of OCD reveals extremely imbalanced learning parameters in patients with OCD. Moreover, effects of behavioral therapy and psychotropic medication are reflected in the model and behavioral results.

                Kaczanowska et al. reconstruct multigenic selection in the human brain, retracing adaptive evolution from motor control in anthropoid ancestry to emerging language skills in early hominins. Anatomically modern humans separated from archaic hominins by further co-evolving language alongside strategic thinking. These traces reflect increasingly complex cognitive demands in archaic environments.

                Choi et al. identify RBM45 as an m6A-binding protein enriched in the developing brain. RBM45 binds to thousands of cellular RNAs, primarily within introns, and regulates constitutive splicing of target transcripts. Loss of RBM45 causes altered expression of neurodevelopmental genes and defects in the proliferation and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.
