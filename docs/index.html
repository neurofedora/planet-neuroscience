              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transient cell-in-cell formation underlies tumor relapse and resistance to immunotherapy</a></h4>

              
                Despite the remarkable successes of cancer immunotherapies, the majority of patients will experience only partial response followed by relapse of resistant tumors. While treatment resistance has frequently been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting, comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors in melanoma and breast cancers indicate that they share the majority of clones. Here, we demonstrate in both mouse models and clinical human samples that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present. This formation is mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, which subsequently induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and early growth response-1 (EGR-1) in tumor cells. Indeed, inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse ancestry whole-genome sequencing association study identifies TBX5 and PTK7 as susceptibility genes for posterior urethral valves</a></h4>

              
                Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease in children, but the genetic architecture of this rare disorder remains unknown. We performed a sequencing-based genome-wide association study (seqGWAS) in 132 unrelated male PUV cases and 23,727 controls of diverse ancestry, identifying statistically significant associations with common variants at 12q24.21 (<i>P</i>=7.8x10<sup>-12</sup>; OR 0.4) and rare variants at 6p21.1 (<i>P</i>=2.0x10<sup>-8</sup>; OR 7.2), that were replicated in an independent European cohort of 395 cases and 4,151 controls. Fine-mapping and functional genomic data mapped these loci to the transcription factor <i>TBX5</i> and planar cell polarity gene <i>PTK7</i>, respectively, the encoded proteins of which were detected in the developing urinary tract of human embryos. We also observed enrichment of rare structural variation intersecting with candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, particularly inversions predicted to affect chromatin looping (<i>P</i>=3.1x10<sup>-5</sup>). These findings represent the first robust genetic associations of PUV, providing novel insights into the underlying biology of this poorly understood disorder and demonstrate how a diverse ancestry seqGWAS can be used for disease locus discovery in a rare disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Malvika Srivastava, Joshua L. Payne</p>

The mapping from genotype to phenotype to fitness typically involves multiple nonlinearities that can transform the effects of mutations. For example, mutations may contribute additively to a phenotype, but their effects on fitness may combine non-additively because selection favors a low or intermediate value of that phenotype. This can cause incongruence between the topographical properties of a fitness landscape and its underlying genotype-phenotype landscape. Yet, genotype-phenotype landscapes are often used as a proxy for fitness landscapes to study the dynamics and predictability of evolution. Here, we use theoretical models and empirical data on transcription factor-DNA interactions to systematically study the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes when selection favors a low or intermediate phenotypic value. Using the theoretical models, we prove a number of fundamental results. For example, selection for low or intermediate phenotypic values does not change simple sign epistasis into reciprocal sign epistasis, implying that genotype-phenotype landscapes with only simple sign epistasis motifs will always give rise to single-peaked fitness landscapes under such selection. More broadly, we show that such selection tends to create fitness landscapes that are more rugged than the underlying genotype-phenotype landscape, but this increased ruggedness typically does not frustrate adaptive evolution because the local adaptive peaks in the fitness landscape tend to be nearly as tall as the global peak. Many of these results carry forward to the empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, which may help to explain why low- and intermediate-affinity transcription factor-DNA interactions are so prevalent in eukaryotic gene regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Is cell segregation like oil and water: Asymptotic versus transitory regime</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Florian Franke, Sebastian Aland, Hans-Joachim Böhme, Anja Voss-Böhme, Steffen Lange</p>

Understanding the segregation of cells is crucial to answer questions about tissue formation in embryos or tumor progression. Steinberg proposed that separation of cells can be compared to the separation of two liquids. Such a separation is well described by the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equations and the segregation indices exhibit an algebraic decay with exponent 1/3 with respect to time. Similar exponents are also observed in cell-based models. However, the scaling behavior in these numerical models is usually only examined in the asymptotic regime and these models have not been directly applied to actual cell segregation data. In contrast, experimental data also reveals other scaling exponents and even slow logarithmic scaling laws. These discrepancies are commonly attributed to the effects of collective motion or velocity-dependent interactions. By calibrating a 2D cellular automaton (CA) model which efficiently implements a dynamic variant of the differential adhesion hypothesis to 2D experimental data from Méhes et al., we reproduce the biological cell segregation experiments with just adhesive forces. The segregation in the cellular automaton model follows a logarithmic scaling initially, which is in contrast to the proposed algebraic scaling with exponent 1/3. However, within the less than two orders of magnitudes in time which are observable in the experiments, a logarithmic scaling may appear as a pseudo-algebraic scaling. In particular, we demonstrate that the cellular automaton model can exhibit a range of exponents ≤1/3 for such a pseudo-algebraic scaling. Moreover, the time span of the experiment falls into the transitory regime of the cellular automaton rather than the asymptotic one. We additionally develop a method for the calibration of the 2D Cahn-Hilliard model and find a match with experimental data within the transitory regime of the Cahn-Hilliard model with exponent 1/4. On the one hand this demonstrates that the transitory behavior is relevant for the experiment rather than the asymptotic one. On the other hand this corroborates the ambiguity of the scaling behavior, when segregation processes can be only observed on short time spans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian estimation of community size and overlap from random subsamples</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik K. Johnson, Daniel B. Larremore</p>

Counting the number of species, items, or genes that are shared between two groups, sets, or communities is a simple calculation when sampling is complete. However, when only partial samples are available, quantifying the overlap between two communities becomes an estimation problem. Furthermore, to calculate normalized measures of <i>β</i>-diversity, such as the Jaccard and Sorenson-Dice indices, one must also estimate the total sizes of the communities being compared. Previous efforts to address these problems have assumed knowledge of total community sizes and then used Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates with quantified uncertainty. Here, we address communities of unknown size and show that this produces systematically better estimates—both in terms of central estimates and quantification of uncertainty in those estimates. We further show how to use species, item, or gene count data to refine estimates of community size in a Bayesian joint model of community size and overlap.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Synaptic balancing: A biologically plausible local learning rule that provably increases neural network noise robustness without sacrificing task performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher H. Stock, Sarah E. Harvey, Samuel A. Ocko, Surya Ganguli</p>

We introduce a novel, biologically plausible local learning rule that provably increases the robustness of neural dynamics to noise in nonlinear recurrent neural networks with homogeneous nonlinearities. Our learning rule achieves higher noise robustness without sacrificing performance on the task and without requiring any knowledge of the particular task. The plasticity dynamics—an integrable dynamical system operating on the weights of the network—maintains a multiplicity of conserved quantities, most notably the network’s entire temporal map of input to output trajectories. The outcome of our learning rule is a synaptic balancing between the incoming and outgoing synapses of every neuron. This synaptic balancing rule is consistent with many known aspects of experimentally observed heterosynaptic plasticity, and moreover makes new experimentally testable predictions relating plasticity at the incoming and outgoing synapses of individual neurons. Overall, this work provides a novel, practical local learning rule that exactly preserves overall network function and, in doing so, provides new conceptual bridges between the disparate worlds of the neurobiology of heterosynaptic plasticity, the engineering of regularized noise-robust networks, and the mathematics of integrable Lax dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparing human and model-based forecasts of COVID-19 in Germany and Poland</a></h4>

Forecasts based on epidemiological modelling have played an important role in shaping public policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This modelling combines knowledge about infectious disease dynamics with the subjective opinion of the researcher who develops and refines the model and often also adjusts model outputs. Developing a forecast model is difficult, resource- and time-consuming. It is therefore worth asking what modelling is able to add beyond the subjective opinion of the researcher alone. To investigate this, we analysed different real-time forecasts of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Germany and Poland over a 1-4 week horizon submitted to the German and Polish Forecast Hub. We compared crowd forecasts elicited from researchers and volunteers, against a) forecasts from two semi-mechanistic models based on common epidemiological assumptions and b) the ensemble of all other models submitted to the Forecast Hub. We found crowd forecasts, despite being overconfident, to outperform all other methods across all forecast horizons when forecasting cases (weighted interval score relative to the Hub ensemble 2 weeks ahead: 0.89). Forecasts based on computational models performed comparably better when predicting deaths (rel. WIS 1.26), suggesting that epidemiological modelling and human judgement can complement each other in important ways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spatially resolved stochastic model reveals the role of supercoiling in transcription regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuncong Geng, Christopher Herrick Bohrer, Nicolás Yehya, Hunter Hendrix, Lior Shachaf, Jian Liu, Jie Xiao, Elijah Roberts</p>

In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, translocation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) during transcription introduces supercoiling to DNA, which influences the initiation and elongation behaviors of RNAP. To quantify the role of supercoiling in transcription regulation, we developed a spatially resolved supercoiling model of transcription. The integrated model describes how RNAP activity feeds back with the local DNA supercoiling and how this mechanochemical feedback controls transcription, subject to topoisomerase activities and stochastic topological domain formation. This model establishes that transcription-induced supercoiling mediates the cooperation of co-transcribing RNAP molecules in highly expressed genes, and this cooperation is achieved under moderate supercoiling diffusion and high topoisomerase unbinding rates. It predicts that a topological domain could serve as a transcription regulator, generating substantial transcriptional noise. It also shows the relative orientation of two closely arranged genes plays an important role in regulating their transcription. The model provides a quantitative platform for investigating how genome organization impacts transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Omitting age-dependent mosquito mortality in malaria models underestimates the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melissa A. Iacovidou, Priscille Barreaux, Simon E. F. Spencer, Matthew B. Thomas, Erin E. Gorsich, Kat S. Rock</p>

Mathematical models of vector-borne infections, including malaria, often assume age-independent mortality rates of vectors, despite evidence that many insects senesce. In this study we present survival data on insecticide-resistant <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i>. from experiments in Côte d’Ivoire. We fit a constant mortality function and two age-dependent functions (logistic and Gompertz) to the data from mosquitoes exposed (treated) and not exposed (control) to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), to establish biologically realistic survival functions. This enables us to explore the effects of insecticide exposure on mosquito mortality rates, and the extent to which insecticide resistance might impact the effectiveness of ITNs. We investigate this by calculating the expected number of infectious bites a mosquito will take in its lifetime, and by extension the vectorial capacity. Our results show that the predicted vectorial capacity is substantially lower in mosquitoes exposed to ITNs, despite the mosquitoes in the experiment being highly insecticide-resistant. The more realistic age-dependent functions provide a better fit to the experimental data compared to a constant mortality function and, hence, influence the predicted impact of ITNs on malaria transmission potential. In models with age-independent mortality, there is a great reduction for the vectorial capacity under exposure compared to no exposure. However, the two age-dependent functions predicted an even larger reduction due to exposure, highlighting the impact of incorporating age in the mortality rates. These results further show that multiple exposures to ITNs had a considerable effect on the vectorial capacity. Overall, the study highlights the importance of including age dependency in mathematical models of vector-borne disease transmission and in fully understanding the impact of interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Animal models of compression spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Compression spinal cord injuries are a common cause of morbidity in people who experience a spinal cord injury (SCI). Either as a by-product of a traumatic injury or due to nontraumatic conditions such as cervical myelitis, compression injuries are growing in prevalence clinically and many attempts of animal replication have been described within the literature. These models, however, often focus on the traumatic side of injury or mimic short-term injuries that are not representative of the majority of compression SCI. Of this, nontraumatic spinal cord injuries are severely understudied and have an increased prevalence in elderly populations, adults, and children. Therefore, there is a need to critically evaluate the current animal models of compression SCI and their suitability as a method for clinically relevant data that can help reduce morbidity and mortality of SCI. In this review, we reviewed the established and emerging methods of animal models of compression SCI. These models are the clip, balloon, solid spacer, expanding polymer, remote, weight drop, calibrated forceps, screw, and strap methods. These methods showed that there is a large reliance on the use of laminectomy to induce injury. Furthermore, the age range of many studies does not reflect the elderly and young populations that commonly suffer from compression injuries. It is therefore important to have techniques and methods that are able to minimize secondary effects of the surgeries, and are representative of the clinical cases seen so that treatments and interventions can be developed that are specific.</p>

<p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of galagos contains a series of domains where electrical stimulation evokes different types of complex movements. The medial domains have more connections with the motor thalamus, whereas the lateral domains connect more densely with the posterior thalamus that involves in somatosensory processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In prosimian galagos, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is subdivided into a number of functional domains where long-train intracortical microstimulation evoked different types of complex movements. Here, we placed anatomical tracers in multiple locations of PPC to reveal the origins and targets of thalamic connections of four PPC domains for different types of hindlimb, forelimb, or face movements. Thalamic connections of all four domains included nuclei of the motor thalamus, ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, as well as parts of the sensory thalamus, the anterior pulvinar, posterior and ventral posterior superior nuclei, consistent with the sensorimotor functions of PPC domains. PPC domains also projected to the thalamic reticular nucleus in a somatotopic pattern. Quantitative differences in the distributions of labeled neurons in thalamic nuclei suggested that connectional patterns of these domains differed from each other.</p>

                The mechanisms that underlie the storage of old nontraumatic episodic memories remain enigmatic because of the difficulty in modelling this particular type of memory in humans and animals. Episodic memories combine incidental and occasional What-Where-When/In which context multisensory information and can be stored for long periods of time. Here, using a task in rodents that models human episodic memory, including odour/place/context components, we applied advanced behavioural and computational analyses and brain imaging of c-Fos and Zif268 to characterize remote episodic memories and their engrams for the first time. We show that the content and accuracy of memories vary across individuals and depend on the emotional relationship with odours experienced during episodes. Activated brain networks reflect the nature and content of remote episodic memories and their transformation over time, and emotional cortico-hippocampal networks play critical roles in maintaining vivid memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic boutons are distributed along the dendrites and somata of VIP neurons in the inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic signaling shapes sound processing and plasticity in the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain hub of the central auditory system, but how cholinergic terminals contact and influence individual neuron types in the IC remains largely unknown. Using pharmacology and electrophysiology, we recently found that acetylcholine strongly excites VIP neurons, a class of glutamatergic principal neurons in the IC, by activating 3{beta}4* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we confirm and extend these results using tissue from mice of both sexes. First, we show that mRNA encoding 3 and {beta}4 nAChR subunits is expressed in many neurons throughout the IC, including most VIP neurons, suggesting that these subunits, which are rare in the brain, are important mediators of cholinergic signaling in the IC. Next, by combining fluorescent labeling of VIP neurons and immunofluorescence against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), we show that individual VIP neurons in the central nucleus of the IC (ICc) are contacted by a large number of cholinergic boutons. Cholinergic boutons were distributed adjacent to the somata and along the full length of the dendritic arbors of VIP neurons, positioning cholinergic signaling to affect synaptic computations arising throughout the somatodendritic compartments of VIP neurons. In addition, cholinergic boutons were observed in close apposition to dendritic spines on VIP neurons, raising the possibility that cholinergic signaling also modulates presynaptic release onto VIP neurons. Together, these results strengthen evidence that cholinergic signaling exerts widespread influence on auditory computations performed by VIP neurons and other neurons in the IC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genomic effects of the glucocorticoid receptor guide the acute stress-induced delayed anxiety and basolateral amygdala spine plasticity in rats</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety, a state related to anticipatory fear, can be adaptive in the face of environmental threats or stressors. However, anxiety can also become persistent and manifest as anxiety- and stress-related disorders, such as generalized anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, systemic administration of glucocorticoids (GCs) or short-term restraint stress induces anxiety-like behaviors and dendritic branching within the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) ten days later. Additionally, increased arousal-related memory retention mediated by elevated GCs requires concomitant noradrenaline (NE) signaling, both acting in the BLA. It is unknown whether GCs and NE play a role in the delayed acute stress effects on BLA dendritic plasticity and behavior. Here, we show that inhibiting corticosterone (CORT) elevation during the two-hour restraint stress prevents stress-induced increases in delayed anxiety-like behaviors and BLA dendritic spine density in rats. Also, we show that acute stress's behavioral and morphological delayed effects are critically dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genomic actions in the BLA. Unlike CORT, the pharmacological enhancement of NE signaling in the BLA was insufficient to drive delayed anxiety-related behavior. Nonetheless, the delayed anxiety-like behavior 10 days after acute stress requires NE signaling in the BLA at the time it is expressed. Therefore, we define essential roles for two stress-related hormones acting at two different times, for the late stress consequences: CORT, via GR, immediately at stress; NE, via beta-adrenoceptors, during the expression of delayed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multiplex platform to identify mechanisms and modulators of proteotoxicity in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative disorders are a family of diseases that remain poorly treated despite their growing global health burden. A shared feature of many neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. To gain insight into the mechanisms and modulators of protein misfolding, we developed a multiplex reverse genetics platform. Using this novel platform 29 cell-based models expressing proteins that undergo misfolding in neurodegeneration were probed against more than a thousand genetic modifiers. The resulting data provide insight into the nature of modifiers that act on multiple misfolded proteins as compared to those that show activity on only one. To illustrate the utility of this platform, we extensively characterized a potent hit from our screens, the human chaperone DNAJB6. We show that DNAJB6 is a general modifier of the toxicity and solubility of multiple amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including FUS, TDP-43, and hnRNPA1. Biophysical examination of DNAJB6 demonstrated that it co-phase separates with, and alters the behavior of FUS containing condensates by locking them into a loose gel-like state which prevents their fibrilization. Domain mapping and a deep mutational scan of DNAJB6 support the critical importance for DNAJB6 phase separation in its effects on multiple RNA-binding proteins. Crucially, these studies also suggest that this property can be further tuned to generate novel variants with enhanced activity that might illuminate potential avenues for clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrating artificial and biological neural networks to improve animal task performance using deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks have performed remarkable feats in a wide variety of domains. However, artificial intelligence algorithms lack the flexibility, robustness, and generalization power of biological neural networks. Given the different capabilities of artificial and biological neural networks, it would be advantageous to build systems where the two types of networks are directly connected and can synergistically interact. As proof of principle, here we show how to create such a hybrid system and how it can be harnessed to improve animal performance on biologically relevant tasks. Using optogenetics, we interfaced the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with a deep reinforcement learning agent, enabling the animal to navigate to targets and enhancing its natural ability to search for food. Agents adapted to strikingly different sites of neural integration and learned site-specific activation patterns to improve performance on a target-finding task. The combined animal and agent displayed cooperative computation between artificial and biological neural networks by generalizing target-finding to novel environments. This work constitutes an initial demonstration of how to robustly improve task performance in animals using artificial intelligence interfaced with a living nervous system.

                Substance use disorder is a debilitating chronic disease and a leading cause of disability around the world. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a major brain hub that mediates reward behavior. Studies demonstrate exposure to cocaine is associated with molecular and functional imbalance in two NAc medium spiny neuron subtypes (MSNs), dopamine receptor 1 and 2 enriched D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs. Our previous reports showed that repeated cocaine exposure induced transcription factor early growth response 3 (Egr3) mRNA in NAc D1-MSNs, while reducing it in D2-MSNs. Here, we report our findings of repeated cocaine exposure inducing cell subtype specific bidirectional expression of the Egr3 corepressor NGFI-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2). Using CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa and CRISPRi) tools combined with Nab2 or Egr3 targeted sgRNAs, we mimicked these bidirectional changes in Neuro2a cells. Furthermore, we investigated D1-MSN and D2-MSN subtype specific expressional changes of histone lysine demethylases Kdm1a, Kdm6a and Kdm5c in NAc after repeated cocaine exposure. Since Kdm1a showed bidirectional expression patterns in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs, like Egr3, we developed a light inducible Opto-CRISPR-KDM1a system. We were able to downregulate Egr3 and Nab2 transcripts and cause bidirectional expression changes in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs similar to cocaine exposure in Neuro2A cells. In contrast, our Opto-CRISPR-p300 activation system induced the Egr3 and Nab2 transcripts and caused bidirectional transcription regulations in D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs. Our study sheds light on the expression patterns of Nab2 and Egr3 in specific NAc MSN subtypes in cocaine action and uses CRISPR tools to further mimic these expression patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Vap33/Eph/Vav/Cdc42 complex confers temporal specification to the outgrowth of primary dendrites in Drosophila neurons</a></h4>

              
                The formation of primary dendrites (dendritogenesis) significantly affects the overall orientation and coverage of dendritic arborization, limiting the number and types of inputs a neuron can receive. Previously we reported how a Drosophila motoneuron spatially controls the positioning of dendritogenesis through the Dscam1/Dock/Pak1 pathway; however, how the neuron defines the timing of this process remains elusive. Here we show that the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase provides a temporal cue. We find that, at the onset of dendritogenesis, the Eph receptor recruits the Rho Family GEF Vav to the intracellular domain of Eph, which transiently activates the Cdc42 family of small GTPase. We also show that vap33 (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein) mutants exhibit defects in Cdc42 activation and dendritic outgrowth, indicating Vap33 may play an upstream role in Eph signaling. Together, our result and previous studies argue that the formation of primary dendrites requires the proximity of active Cdc42 and membrane-anchored Pak1 driven by collaborative action between two distinct signaling complexes, Vap33/Eph/Vav and Dscam1/Dock. Signal integration from multiple input pathways would represent a general mechanism for the spatiotemporal precision of dendrite branch formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread, perception-related information in the human brain scales with levels of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                How does the human brain generate coherent, subjective perceptions--transforming yellow and oblong visual sensory information into the perception of an edible banana? This is a hard problem. The standard viewpoint posits that anatomical and functional networks somehow integrate local, specialized processing across the brain to construct unique percepts. Here, we provide evidence for a novel organizational concept: we uncover task-specific information distributed across the human brain. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based decoding models to probe the presence of task-specific information. In doing so, we show that brain regions that are empirically almost entirely task-independent (considered to be "noise"--i.e., t-statistics {approx} 0--in standard univariate fMRI analyses) can decode various tasks, even without statistical learning tools. Thus, task-specific information is present and readily accessible throughout the neocortex, challenging the sensitivity of traditional linear, univariate analytical approaches. Remarkably, even subcortical structures and the cerebellum contain task-specific signals in voxels that would univariately be considered "noise". Finally, using data from an auditory study with different levels of sedation, we show that the widespread signal in regions remote from the primary and secondary sensory cortices (auditory cortex) depends on the level of sedation, suggesting the brain's widespread, task-specific information is related to perception rather than the encoding of the sensory stimulus. Our analysis uncovers task-specific and consciousness level-dependent information across the human brain, which we hypothesize to be the basis for coherent, subjective perceptions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling temporal and rate codes in primate somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Millisecond-scale temporal spiking patterns encode sensory information in the early stages of processing along the neuraxis, but their role in cortex remains controversial. The sense of touch provides a window into temporal coding because tactile neurons often exhibit precise, repeatable, and informative temporal spiking patterns. In somatosensory cortex (S1), for example, responses to skin vibrations exhibit phase-locking that faithfully carries information about vibratory frequency. However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency influences both perceived pitch and magnitude and shapes both the timing and rates of S1 responses. To disentangle these various elements, we measured S1 responses as animals performed a vibratory frequency discrimination task, in which differences in frequency were accompanied by uninformative variations in amplitude. We then assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of S1 responses could account for the animals' ability to perform the frequency discrimination task in the presence of intensity confounds. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by vibratory amplitude. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude, but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals' behavior, calling into question a rate-based code for frequency. In contrast, timing-based representations are impervious to changes in amplitude, also inconsistent with the animals' behavior. We show that we can account for the animals' behavior with a model wherein frequency coding relies on a temporal code, but judgments of pitch are biased by perceived magnitude. Our results constitute further evidence for the role of millisecond-scale spike timing in cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex represents abstract visual sequences during a no-report task</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring sequential information is an essential component of our daily lives. Many of these sequences are abstract, in that they do not depend on the individual stimuli, but do depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking). Despite the ubiquity and utility of abstract sequential monitoring, little is known about its neural mechanisms. Human rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits specific increases in neural activity (i.e., "ramping") during abstract sequences. Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to represent sequential information in motor (not abstract) sequence tasks, and contains a sub-region, area 46, with homologous functional connectivity to human RLPFC. To test the prediction that area 46 may represent abstract sequence information, and do so with parallel dynamics to those found in humans, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in monkeys. When monkeys performed no-report abstract sequence viewing, we found that right area 46 responded to both abstract sequential rule and number changes. Interestingly, left area 46 exhibited ramping activation similar to that observed in humans that also indicated abstract sequential rule changes. Together, these results indicate that monkey DLPFC monitors abstract visual sequential information, and may do so through unique, hemisphere-specific neural mechanisms. More generally, these results show that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.

                A conditioning lesion of the peripheral sensory axon triggers robust central axon regeneration in mammals. We visualize the ASJ neuron of C. elegans with a cell-specific green fluorescent protein reporter driven by a thioredoxin trx-1 promoter and trigger conditioned regeneration by laser surgery or genetic disruption of sensory pathways. Utilizing calibrated fluorescent beads, we demonstrate that these neurons brighten when conditioned, suggesting that trx-1 expression indicates regenerative capacity. We show that trx-1 functionally enhances conditioned regeneration but inhibits non-conditioned regeneration. Finally, six strains isolated in a forward genetic screen for reduced fluorescence also show reduced axon outgrowth. We demonstrate a link between trx-1 expression and the conditioned state that we leverage to rapidly assess regenerative capacity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative transcriptomics reveals human-specific cortical features</a></h4>

              
                Humans have unique cognitive abilities among primates, including language, but their molecular, cellular, and circuit substrates are poorly understood. We used comparative single nucleus transcriptomics in adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) to understand human-specific features of cellular and molecular organization. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell type composition and laminar organization, and a large shift in proportions of deep layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared to macaque and marmoset. Species differences in gene expression generally mirrored evolutionary distance and were seen in all cell types, although chimpanzees were more similar to gorillas than humans, consistent with faster divergence along the human lineage. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes showed accelerated gene expression changes compared to neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, indicating either relaxed evolutionary constraints or positive selection in these cell types. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning in all or specific cell types, and were significantly enriched near human accelerated regions (HARs) and conserved deletions (hCONDELS) and in cell adhesion and intercellular signaling pathways. These results suggest that relatively few cellular and molecular changes uniquely define adult human cortical structure, particularly by affecting circuit connectivity and glial cell function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse long-range projections convey position information to the retrosplenial cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal signals encoding the animal's position, originally discovered in the hippocampus, widely modulate neocortical processing. While it is assumed that these signals depend on hippocampal output, their origin has not been investigated directly. Here, we asked which brain region sends position information to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a key circuit for navigation and memory. Using two-photon axonal imaging in head-fixed mice performing a spatial task, we performed a comprehensive functional characterization of long-range inputs to agranular RSC. Surprisingly, most long-range pathways convey position information, but with key differences. We found that axons from the secondary motor cortex transmit the most position information. By contrast, axons from the posterior parietal- anterior cingulate- and orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus convey substantially less position information. Axons from the primary- and secondary visual cortex make a negligible contribution. These data show that RSC is a node in a widely distributed ensemble of networks that share position information in a projection-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiological constraints on the rapid dopaminergic modulation of striatal reward activity</a></h4>

              
                While the contribution of dopaminergic (DA) neurons to associative learning is firmly established, their importance for influencing imminent behavior on short (subsecond) timescales is less clear. Mechanistically, it is thought that DA neurons drive these behavioral changes because of their ability to rapidly alter striatal spiking activity. However, due to limitations of previous approaches, the straightforward prediction that striatal spiking is rapidly influenced by physiologically relevant DA signals has not been rigorously tested. Here, we monitored changes in spiking responses in the ventral striatum while transiently reducing or increasing DA levels. Contrary to the predicted effect, neither spontaneous nor reward-evoked striatal spiking activity was strongly influenced by optogenetic manipulations, except when DA exceeded reward-matched levels. These findings challenge the view that DA plays a major role in rapidly influencing striatal activity. Finally, they suggest a need to distinguish between the modulatory functions of DA under physiological and supra-physiological conditions.

                Reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) network extends healthspan and lifespan in mammals and possibly humans. Loss of the Irs1 gene increases survival in mice and causes tissue-specific changes in gene expression. However, the tissues underlying IIS mediated longevity are currently unknown. Here we measured survival and healthspan in male and female animals lacking Irs1 activity specifically in the liver, muscle, fat and brain. Tissue-specific loss of IRS1 did not increase survival, suggesting that lack of Irs1 in more than one tissue is required for lifespan extension. Furthermore, loss of Irs1 in liver, muscle and fat did not improve health at old age. In contrast, loss of neuronal Irs1 increased energy expenditure, locomotion and insulin sensitivity, specifically in old males. Neuronal loss of IRS1 also caused male-specific mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of Atf4 and metabolic adaptations consistent with an activated integrated stress response at old age. Thus, we identified a male-specific brain signature of ageing in response to reduced IIS associated with improved health outcomes at old age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neuron that regulates locomotion makes a potential sensory cilium lying over the C. elegans egg-laying apparatus</a></h4>

              
                The neural circuit for C. elegans egg laying has been studied intensively for decades, yet it is not clear that its known components can account for how egg-laying and locomotion behaviors are coordinated. We found that the two PVP neurons, which release neuropeptides that promote roaming locomotion, make previously-undescribed branches that terminate in large wing-shaped endings directly over the egg-laying apparatus. The PVP branches occur in hermaphrodites but not males and develop during the L4 larval stage when the egg-laying system also develops. The PVP wing is located at the junction between the uterus and the vulva, adjacent to neurons that control egg laying, and surrounded by cells that we found label with a glial marker. The morphology of the PVP wing and its envelopment within possible glial cells are consistent with the hypothesis that the PVP wing is a sensory cilium. Although PVP is reported to express sensory receptor homologs, we have been unable to detect PVP expression of more specific markers of neural cilia, and we have also not detected strong PVP defects in the daf-19 mutant, which does show defects in known neural cilia. The PVPs are extraordinarily sensitive to expression of transgenes, which cause developmental and possibly functional defects in these neurons. This has prevented us from recording or manipulating PVP activity to determine its functional roles. Thus, the intriguing hypothesis that PVP is a sensory neuron that might coordinate egg laying and locomotion will remain speculative until better methods to manipulate PVP can be developed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Can neural correlates of encoding explain the context dependence of reward-enhanced memory?</a></h4>

              
                Selective encoding can be studied by manipulating how valuable it is for participants to remember specific stimuli, for instance by varying the monetary reward participants receive for recalling a particular stimulus in a subsequent memory test. It would be reasonable for participants to strategically attend more to high-reward items compared to low-reward items in mixed list contexts, but to attend both types of items equally in pure list contexts, where all items are of equal value. Reward-enhanced memory may be driven by automatic dopaminergic interactions between reward circuitry and the hippocampus and thus be insensitive to list context; or it may be driven by meta-cognitive strategies, and thus context-dependent. We contrasted these alternatives by manipulating list composition, and tracked selective encoding through multiple EEG measures of attention and rehearsal. Reward-enhanced memory depended on list composition: recall of high-reward items was increased in mixed, but not pure, lists. This result and aspects of the recall dynamics confirm predictions of the eCMR (emotional Context Maintenance and Retrieval) model. The power of steady-state visual evoked potentials was lower for high-reward items regardless of list composition, suggesting that high reward decreased visual processing of the stimuli and that ssVEPs may index the modulation of context-to-item associations predicted by eCMR. By contrast, reward modulated the amplitude of Late Positive Potential and Frontal Slow Wave only in mixed lists, mimicking the memory results. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the involvement of both automatic and strategic processes in how selective encoding shapes eventual memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing speech: The cerebral substrate of tickertape synesthesia.</a></h4>

              
                Reading acquisition is enabled by deep changes in the brain's visual system and language areas, and in the links subtending their collaboration. Disruption of those plastic processes commonly results in developmental dyslexia. However, atypical development of reading mechanisms may occasionally result in ticker-tape synesthesia (TTS), a condition described by Francis Galton in 1883 wherein individuals "see mentally in print every word that is uttered (...) as from a long imaginary strip of paper". While reading is the bottom-up translation of letters into speech, TTS may be viewed as its opposite, the top-down translation of speech into internally visualized letters. In a series of functional MRI experiments, we studied MK, a man with TTS. We showed that a set of left-hemispheric areas were more active in MK than in controls during the perception of normal than reversed speech, including frontoparietal areas involved in speech processing, and the Visual Word Form Area, an occipitotemporal region subtending orthography. Those areas were identical to those involved in reading, supporting the construal of TTS as upended reading. Using dynamic causal modeling, we further showed that, parallel to reading, TTS induced by spoken words and pseudowords relied on top-down flow of information along distinct lexical and phonological routes, involving the middle temporal and supramarginal gyri, respectively. Future studies of TTS should shed new light on the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of reading acquisition, their variability and their disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed coding of evidence accumulation across the mouse brain using microcircuits with a diversity of timescales</a></h4>

              
                The gradual accumulation of noisy evidence for or against options is the main step in the perceptual decision-making process. Using brain-wide electrophysiological recording in mice (Steinmetz et al., 2019), we examined neural correlates of evidence accumulation across multiple brain areas. We demonstrated that the neurons across the brain exhibited ramping-like firing rate activity that was modulated by the strength of evidence. These neurons had distinct properties in their intrinsic timescale, which were organized hierarchically across the brain. Our findings support the existence of evidence accumulation over multiple timescales. Besides variability across brain regions, a heterogeneity of intrinsic timescales was observed within each brain region as well. We demonstrated that this variability reflected the heterogeneity of microcircuit accumulation parameters, such that populations with longer timescales had higher recurrent excitation strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal intrinsic neural timescale in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: The intrinsic neural timescale in a local brain area has been specialized, and the sensory and prefrontal areas have shorter and longer timescales, respectively. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that also exhibits with abnormal neural activity in sensorimotor, visual, and cognitive-related areas. However, it was unclear whether PD patients exhibited abnormal intrinsic timescales and whether PD patients exhibited different temporal feature at different stages. Methods: Here, we estimated the intrinsic timescales using the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in 74 PD patients, including 44 patients in the early stage (PD-ES) and 30 patients in the late stage (PD-LS), and 73 healthy controls (HC). Results: We identified that the PD group had shorter timescales in bilateral lingual and calcarine gyri, bilateral postcentral and precentral gyri, and the right middle cingulum gyrus than the HC group, which correlated with the age, but not in the HC group. Moreover, shorter timescales in the PD group also correlated with the symptom severity and reduced grey matter volume (GMV). Longer timescale in the right middle frontal gyrus was also found in the PD group than that in the HC group. Increasingly, compared to the HC group, the PD-ES group had longer timescales in the anterior cortical regions, including the left superior and inferior frontal gyri, and the right middle frontal gyrus, whereas the PD-LS group had shorter timescales in the posterior cortical regions, including bilateral calcarine and lingual gyri, which accompanied with more serious cognitive impairments and reduced GMV. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PD patients exhibit abnormal intrinsic timescales in visual, sensorimotor, and cognitive systems, which might provide new insights for the neural substrate of PD. Distinct patterns of intrinsic timescales in cerebral cortex between the PD-LS and PD-ES groups indicate that intrinsic timescale might be a new neuroimaging biomarker across disease stage in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">To be and not to be: Wide-field Ca2+ imaging reveals neocortical functional segmentation combines stability and flexibility</a></h4>

              
                The stability and flexibility of the functional parcellation of the cerebral cortex is fundamental to how familiar and novel information is both represented and stored. We leveraged new advances in Ca2+ sensors and microscopy to understand the dynamics of functional segmentation in the dorsal cerebral cortex. We performed wide-field Ca2+ imaging in head-fixed mice and used spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify independent spatial sources of Ca2+ fluorescence. The imaging data were evaluated over multiple timescales and discrete behaviors including resting, walking, and grooming. When evaluated over the entire dataset, a set of template independent components (ICs) were identified that were common across behaviors. Template ICs were present across a range of timescales, from days to 30 seconds, although with lower occurrence probability at shorter timescales, highlighting the stability of the functional segmentation. Importantly, unique ICs emerged at the shorter duration timescales that could act to transiently refine the cortical network. When data were evaluated by behavior, both common and behavior-specific ICs emerged. Each behavior is composed of unique combinations of common and behavior-specific ICs. These observations suggest that cerebral cortical functional segmentation exhibits considerable spatial stability over time and behaviors while retaining the flexibility for task-dependent reorganization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relative Brain Age Is Associated with Socioeconomic Status and Anxiety/Depression Problems in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to differences in brain structure and psychiatric risk across the lifespan. Despite many neuropsychiatric disorders emerging in childhood, few studies have examined the influence of SES on brain aging and psychopathology in youth. We re-analyzed relative brain age (RBA) data from the Healthy Brain Network to examine the influence of SES components (parent education, occupation, household income-to-needs ratio (INR), public assistance enrollment) on RBA. RBA was previously determined using covariation patterns for cortical morphology, white, and subcortical gray matter volumes without SES in predictive models. We also examined associations between RBA and psychiatric symptoms (child behavior checklist). Full case analysis included 470 youth (5-17 years; 61.3% male), self-identifying as White (55%), African American (15%), Hispanic (9%), or multiracial (17.2%). Mean household income was 3.95+/-2.33 (Mean+/-SD) times the federal poverty threshold. Multiple linear regression examined if 1) SES components associated with RBA, and 2) RBA associated with psychiatric symptoms. Models covaried for sex, scan location, and parent psychiatric diagnoses. RBA associated with public assistance (p = 0.03), parent occupation (p = 0.01), and parent psychiatric diagnosis (p = 0.01), but not with INR and parent education. Parent occupation (p = 0.02) and RBA (p = 0.04) associated with CBCL anxiety/depression scores. Components of SES associated with brain aging, underscoring the risk of omitting these factors in developmental brain research. Further, delayed brain aging was associated with low parental occupational prestige and child anxiety/depression scores, suggesting a possible biological pathway from SES to mental health risk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disturbing standing balance evokes an error-related negativity</a></h4>

              
                The error-related negativity (ERN) is a neural correlate of error monitoring often used to investigate individual differences in developmental, pathological, and adaptive contexts. However, limited experimental control over errors presents several confounds to its measurement. An experimentally controlled disturbance to standing balance evokes the balance N1, which we previously suggested may share underlying mechanisms with the ERN. We test the possibility of shared underlying mechanisms by testing whether the balance N1 and ERN are associated in amplitude across individuals within two populations across the adult lifespan (N=21 young adults and N=20 older adults). ERNs were measured in two versions of an arrow flanker task where responses were entered by the hand (ERN-hand) or feet (ERN-foot). The balance N1 was evoked by sudden slip-like movements of the floor beneath a standing participant. The ERNs and the balance N1 showed good to excellent internal consistency and were correlated in amplitude in both populations. One principal component accounted for approximately 80% of variance as being shared across the three evoked responses within each group, but the association between the ERN-hand and ERN-foot remained significant when the balance N1 was included in the model. The results suggest the balance N1 and ERN share mechanisms underlying individual differences in error monitoring. Balance perturbations may therefore provide a well-controlled method for examining individual differences in the neural system that monitors errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of Frontal Eye Field in Saccadic Mixed-strategy Decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Game theory can predict the distribution of choices in aggregate during mixed-strategy games, yet the neural process mediating individual probabilistic choices remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of frontal eye field (FEF) in a decision-making task when macaques were trained to play a mixed-strategic game Matching Pennies against a computer opponent. Neuronal activities of FEF neurons predicted the animals' upcoming saccadic choices and these activities became increasingly more selective as the choice deadline approached. Subthreshold electrical micro-stimulation applied in FEF also biased choices. Extended stimulation biased choices towards the preferred FEF vector whereas early termination of stimulation biased choices away from the preferred FEF vector. By contrast, micro-stimulation biased choices in the preferred direction during a non-strategic perceptual luminance discrimination task. We conclude that FEF is causally contributing to mixed-strategy decision-making process although the timing of FEF activation contributes to the decision process in a more non-linear manner during strategic compared to perceptual decision-making.

                Abnormal amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) abnormal accumulation and oxidative stress play important roles in Alzheimer' disease (AD). Quercetin has been reported to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and thus of therapeutic interests for neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the mechanisms by which quercetin exerts neuroprotective effects in murine neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing human Swedishh mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Quercetin treatment exhibited low cytoxicity, attenuated APP expression and APP-induced oxidative neurotoxicity in N2a/APP cells. We found that quercetin effected via the down-regulation of phospho-extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (p-ERK1/2) pathway and up-regulation of phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT) pathway in N2a/APP cells. In addition, quercetin ameliorated the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species using DCFH-DA flow-cytometry in N2a/APP cells, lipid peroxidation using (4-HNE), and DNA oxidation (8-OHdG assays). Quercetin ameliorated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 fluorescence assay in N2a/APP cells in a dose-dependent mannor. In conclusion, we domenstrated the neuroprotective effects of quercetin against the APP expression induced oxidative neurotoxicity, impairment of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress through inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and activation of AKT signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A T1R-independent mechanism for responses to hyperosmotic sugars involves a carbonic anhydrase-sensitive mechanism in Type III receptor cells</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that the rostral nucleus of solitary tract (rNST) retains some responsiveness to glutamate (MSG+amiloride-MSGa) and sugars in mice lacking the canonical T1R receptors for these tastants. Here, we recorded from the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in mice lacking the T1R1+T1R3 heterodimer (KO1+3), using warm stimuli to optimize sugar responses and employing extended concentrations and pharmacological agents to probe mechanisms. MSGa+IMP responses were not synergized in KO1+3 mice but responses to MSGa were similar to those in B6 (WT) mice. Glutamate responses in the neurons tested were unaffected by topical application of an mGluR4 antagonist. PBN T1R-independent sugar responses, including those to concentrated glucose, were more evident than in rNST. Sugar responses were undiminished by phlorizin, an inhibitor of SGLT, a component of a hypothesized alternative glucose-sensing mechanism. There were no sugar/umami "best" neurons in KO1+3 mice, and instead, sugars activated cells that displayed acid and amiloride-insensitive NaCl responses. In WTs, concentrated sugars activated "sugar/umami" cells but also electrolyte-sensitive neurons. The efficacy of hyperosmotic sugars for driving neurons broadly responsive to electrolytes implied an origin from Type III taste bud cells. To test this, we used the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor dorzolamide (DRZ), previously shown to inhibit amiloride-insensitive sodium responses arising from Type III cells. Dorzolamide had no effect on sugar-elicited responses in WT sugar/umami PBN neurons but strongly suppressed them in WT and KO electrolyte-generalist neurons. These findings suggest a novel T1R-independent mechanism for hyperosmotic sugars, involving a CA-dependent mechanism in Type-III taste bud cells.

                Primates readily learn new visual objects, with neurons in the inferior temporal cortex exhibiting diminished visual responses to familiar stimuli. The mechanisms of visual plasticity expressed within a neural population are largely unknown. Here we used chronic microwire electrodes in a face-selective cortical area in the macaque to longitudinally track cohorts of neurons across several weeks of exposure to novel faces. Neurons showed gradual adaptation in their late-phase visual responses, with cell-specific time constants ranging from two to twenty days. These time constants were governed by the number of testing days rather than by the cumulative number of stimulus exposures. This gradual buildup of altered visual responses may serve as an internal and graded mark of stimulus familiarity, a central component of visual recognition.

                Activity across prefrontal cortical populations represents stimuli in a low-dimensional manifold that often undergoes transformations during the execution of cognitive tasks. These dynamics are commonly thought to be determined by whatever cognitive operation is being performed at the time, for example, rotation of stimulus representation in population activity during working memory is thought to reduce interference by subsequent distractors. The assumption that cognitive operations dictate stimulus transformations has not yet been tested experimentally. Here we show that the activity space of prefrontal neurons in naive monkeys exhibits significant rotations, some aspects of which remain remarkably unchanged after training to perform working memory tasks. Training does induce changes in population dynamics, which further distinguish correct and error trials during task execution. Our results reveal automatic functions of prefrontal neural circuits that form the substrate of cognitive flexibility.

                Acute stress has a profound effect on attention selection, however, it remains unclear how acute stress affects target enhancement and distractor suppression in attention selection. The current study aimed to investigated the acute stress effect on target enhancement and distractor suppression in a visual search task by using ERP. The stress response was successfully induced as indexed by the activation of HPA and the subjective affect rating. Crucially, acute stress group showed significant smaller N2pc than the control group in the high-salience distractor condition, no significant differences of Pd was observed, which indicated that actue stress disrupts the target enhancement rather than the distractor suppression in attention selection. The detrimental effects might attribute to the impairing function of prefrontal cortex. The current study provide clear evidences of the impairment of target enhancement under acute stress, and reveal the cognitive mechanism of acute stress effects on attention selection.

                Recent experimental observations have shown that the reactivation of hippocampal place cells (PC) during sleep or immobility depicts trajectories that can go around barriers and can flexibly adapt to a changing maze layout. Such layout-conforming replay sheds a light on how the activity of place cells supports the learning of flexible navigation in a dynamically changing maze. However, existing computational models of replay fall short of generating layout-conforming replay, restricting their usage to simple environments, like linear tracks or open fields. In this paper, we propose a computational model that generates layout-conforming replay and explains how such replay drives the learning of flexible navigation in a maze. First, we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the inter-PC synaptic strength during exploring a maze. Then we use a continuous attractor network (CAN) with feedback inhibition to model the interaction among place cells and hippocampal interneurons. The activity bump of place cells drifts along a path in the maze, which models layout-conforming replay. During replay in rest, the synaptic strengths from place cells to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a novel dopamine-modulated three-factor rule to store place-reward associations. During goal-directed navigation, the CAN periodically generates replay trajectories from the animal's location for path planning, and the trajectory leading to a maximal MSN activity is followed by the animal. We have implemented our model into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics simulator. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that its superior flexibility during navigation in a maze is due to a continuous re-learning of inter-PC and PC-MSN synaptic strength.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of LRP1 from GABAergic neurons impairs short-term memory function</a></h4>

              
                Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolic signal transport across the brain, while its dysfunction has been associated with cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimers disease. However, the impact of LRP1 in GABAergic neurons on neurodegeneration and memory is poorly understood. Mice lacking LRP1 in GABAergic neurons (Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP) were subjected to behavioral tests for memory and learning. Here we show that the loss of LRP1 in GABAergic neurons causes significant impairment in short-term memory. The spatial Y-maze test revealed that Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP mice exhibited decreased travel distance and duration in the novel arm compared to the controls (LRP1loxP/loxP mice). A reduction in correct responses to find the escape platform in the water T-maze test was found when LRP1 is absent in GABAergic neurons. Moreover, the distance and duration in the novel arm as well as the performance of the reversal water T-maze test were negatively correlated with body weight as well as serum levels of leptin, insulin, and ApoJ. Mice lacking LRP1 in GABAergic neurons displayed decreased freezing time in the contextual and cued fear conditioning test. Histopathological evaluation of the hippocampus revealed that Vgat-Cre; LRP1loxP/loxP mice had greater neuronal necrosis and neuroinflammation than those of LRP1loxP/loxP mice. These findings suggest that LRP1 in GABAergic neurons may play a crucial role in maintaining normal memory function and could be a molecular target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurofibromin 1 mediates sleep depth in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neural regulation of sleep and metabolic homeostasis are critical in many aspects of human health. Despite extensive epidemiological evidence linking sleep dysregulation with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, little is known about the neural and molecular basis for the integration of sleep and metabolic function. The RAS GTPase-activating gene Neurofibromin (Nf1) has been implicated in the regulation of sleep and metabolic rate, raising the possibility that it serves to integrate these processes, but the effects on sleep consolidation and physiology remain poorly understood. A key hallmark of sleep depth in mammals and flies is a reduction in metabolic rate during sleep. Here, we use indirect calorimetry to define the role of Nf1 on sleep-dependent changes in metabolic rate. Flies lacking Nf1 fail to suppress metabolic rate during sleep, raising the possibility that loss of Nf1 prevents flies from integrating sleep and metabolic state. Sleep of Nf1 mutant flies is fragmented with a reduced arousal threshold in Nf1 mutants, suggesting Nf1 flies fail to enter deep sleep. The effects of Nf1 on sleep can be localized to a subset of neurons expressing the GABA receptor Rdl. Selective knockdown of Nf1 in Rdl-expressing neurons increases gut permeability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gut, suggesting a critical role for deep sleep in gut homeostasis. Together, these findings suggest Nf1 acts in GABA-sensitive neurons to modulate sleep depth in Drosophila.

	<p>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of liquid embolization agents for treating various hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients who suffered from hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms and were treated with liquid embolization agents. We used the modified Rankin scale for follow-up at 6 months postoperatively, and digital subtraction angiography follow-up was performed 6 months postoperatively. Results: Of the 38 patients (ten of simple peripheral intracranial aneurysms, six of Moyamoya disease (MMD), and 22 of arteriovenous malformation (AVM)), posterior circulation accounted for the most significant proportion (57.9%), followed by anterior circulation (21.1%) and intranidal aneurysms (21.1%). Intraoperative hemorrhage occurred in four cases, postoperative cerebral infarction occurred in four cases, two patients encountered microcatheter retention, and intraoperative thrombosis took place in the basilar artery of a patient with an arteriovenous malformation. A postoperative hemorrhage occurred in only one patient. At 6-month follow-up, 84.2% of patients had good prognosis outcomes, and 13.5% had poor outcomes. Conclusion: Liquid embolization agents are effective for hemorrhagic peripheral intracranial aneurysms; however, safety depends on the subtypes. For peripheral hemorrhagic aneurysms in MMD, the vessel architecture must be carefully evaluated before embolization.</p>

	<p>Background: The APOE4 allele is a genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Previous work by our group revealed that female APOE4 homozygotes with Lewy body (LB) pathology were more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers, whereas in males there was no APOE4 dose-dependent significant effect. The objective of this study was to refine our previous findings by adjusting for covariates and determining the probability of an APOE4 sex-mediated effect on psychosis. Methods: Neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with LB pathology (n = 491) and without LB pathology (n = 716) were extracted from the National Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Coordinating Center (NACC). Patients were classified as psychotic if they scored positively for delusions and/or hallucinations on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Analysis consisted of a preliminary unadjusted binary logistic regression and a Generalized Additive binary logistic regression Model (GAM) to predict the relationship between APOE4 status and sex on the presence of psychosis in both cohorts, adjusting for age, education and MMSE. Results: In the cohort with LB pathology, female APOE4 homozygotes were significantly more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers (OR = 4.15, 95%CI [1.21, 14.2], p = 0.023). Female heterozygotes were also more likely to experience psychosis compared to female APOE4 non-carriers, but to a lesser extent (OR = 2.37, 95%CI [1.01, 5.59], p = 0.048). There was no significant difference in males with LB pathology or in any sex in the cohort without LB pathology. Conclusions: Sex and zygosity influence the effect of APOE4 on psychosis in neuropathologically confirmed AD patients, with the effect being limited to females with LB pathology.</p>

	<p>New approaches in aphasia rehabilitation have recently identified the crucial role of executive functions (EFs) in language recovery, especially for people with severe aphasia (PWSA). Indeed, EFs include high-order cognitive abilities such as planning and problem solving, which enable humans to adapt to novel situations and are essential for everyday functional communication. In a randomized double-blind crossover design, twenty chronic Italian PWSA underwent ten days of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (20 min, 2 mA) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Two conditions were considered, i.e., anodal and sham, while performing four types of cognitive training (alertness, selective attention, visuo-spatial working memory, and planning), all of which were related to executive functions. After anodal tDCS, a greater improvement in selective attention, visuospatial working memory and planning abilities was found compared to the sham condition; this improvement persisted one month after the intervention. Importantly, a significant improvement was also observed in functional communication, as measured through the Communication Activities of Daily Living Scale, in noun and verb naming, in auditory and written language comprehension tasks and in executive function abilities. This evidence emphasizes, for the first time, that tDCS over the right DLPFC combined with executive training enhances functional communication in severe aphasia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cingulo-opercular network is composed of two distinct sub-systems</a></h4>

              
                The cingulo-opercular (CO) network and its two best studied regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insula - have been linked to task control, but also implicated in many additional processes across cognitive, social, and emotional domains. However, most prior work investigating the CO network has used a group-average approach, which may mix signals across nearby regions that vary across individuals. Here, we reevaluate the CO network's role in task control with both task and rest fMRI, using regions with a high probability of CO network agreement across individuals. Hierarchical clustering analyses suggest heterogeneity in the CO network's task response properties, with one sub-system (CO1) showing consistency with prior task control characterizations while another sub-system (CO2) has weak task control responses, but preserved ties to pain and motor functions. Resting-state connectivity confirms subtle differences in the architecture of these two sub-systems. This evidence suggests that, when individual variation in network locations is addressed, the CO network includes (at least) two linked sub-systems with differential roles in task control and other cognitive/motor/interoceptive responses, which may help explain varied accounts of its functions. We propose that this fractionation may reflect expansion of primary CO body-oriented control functions to broader domain-general contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive compensation of arcuate fasciculus lateralization in developmental dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have reported anomalies in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) lateralization in developmental dyslexia (DD). Still, the relationship between AF lateralization and literacy skills in DD remains largely unknown. The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between the lateralization of the AF anterior segment (AFAS), AF long segment (AFLS), and AF posterior segment (AFPS) in connection to literacy skills in DD. The participants included 26 children with dyslexia and 31 age-matched children in the control group. High angular diffusion imaging, combined with spherical deconvolution tractography, was used to reconstruct the AF. Connectivity measures of hindrance-modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) were computed for each of the three segments of the AF: anterior segment (AFAS), long segment (AFLS), and posterior segment (AFPS). The lateralization index (LI) of each AF segment was calculated by (right HMOA - left HMOA) / (right HMOA + left HMOA). Results showed that the LIs of AFAS and AFLS were positively correlated with reading accuracy in children with dyslexia. Specifically, the LI of AFAS was positively correlated with text and nonword reading accuracy, while the LI of AFLS accounted for word reading accuracy. The results suggest adaptive compensation of arcuate fasciculus lateralization in developmental dyslexia and functional dissociation of the anterior segment and long segment in the compensation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Children's syntax is supported by the maturation of BA44 at 4 years, but of the posterior STS at 3 years of age</a></h4>

              
                Within the first years of life, children learn major aspects of their native language. However, the ability to process complex sentence structures, a core faculty in human language called syntax, has been found to emerge only slowly. A milestone in the acquisition of syntax is reached around the age of 4, when children learn a variety of syntactic concepts, including, for example, subordinate clauses. Here, we ask which maturational changes in the child's brain underlie the emergence of syntactic abilities around this critical age. We relate markers of cortical brain maturation to 3- and 4-year-olds' syntactic in contrast to other language abilities. Our results show that distinct cortical brain areas support syntax in the two age groups: While 3-year-old children's syntactic abilities were associated with increased surface area in the most posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus, 4-year-old children showed an association with cortical thickness in the left posterior part of Broca's area, i.e. BA44. The present findings suggest that syntactic abilities rely on the maturation of distinct cortical regions in 3- compared to 4-year-olds. The observed shift to more mature regions involved in syntax may underlie the behavioral milestones in syntax acquisition around 4 years of age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spatiotemporal map of the aging mouse brain reveals white matter tracts as vulnerable foci</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the key risk factor for loss of cognitive function and neurodegeneration but our knowledge of molecular dynamics across the aging brain is very limited. Here we perform spatiotemporal RNA-seq of mouse brain aging, encompassing 847 samples from 15 regions spanning 7 ages. We identify a brain-wide gene signature representing aging in glia with spatially-defined magnitudes. By integrating spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics, we reveal that glia aging is profoundly accelerated in white matter compared to cortical areas. We further discover region-specific expression changes in specialized neuronal populations. Finally, we discover distinct clusters of brain regions that differentially express genes associated with 3 human neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting regional aging as potential modulator of disease. Our findings identify molecular foci of brain aging, providing a foundation to target age-related cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conserved whole-brain spatiomolecular gradients shape adult brain functional organization</a></h4>

              
                Cortical arealization arises during neurodevelopment from the confluence of molecular gradients representing patterned expression of morphogens and transcription factors. However, how these gradients relate to adult brain function, and whether they are maintained in the adult brain, remains unknown. Here we uncover three axes of topographic variation in gene expression in the adult human brain that specifically capture previously identified rostral-caudal, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes of early developmental patterning. The interaction of these spatiomolecular gradients i) accurately predicts the location of unseen brain tissue samples, ii) delineates known functional territories, and iii) explains the topographical variation of diverse cortical features. The spatiomolecular gradients are distinct from canonical cortical functional hierarchies differentiating primary sensory cortex from association cortex, but radiate in parallel with the axes traversed by local field potentials along the cortex. We replicate all three molecular gradients in three independent human datasets as well as two non-human primate datasets, and find that each gradient shows a distinct developmental trajectory across the lifespan. The gradients are composed of several well known morphogens (e.g., PAX6 and SIX3), and a small set of genes shared across gradients are strongly enriched for multiple diseases. Together, these results provide insight into the developmental sculpting of functionally distinct brain regions, governed by three robust transcriptomic axes embedded within brain parenchyma.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quotidian Profile of Vergence Angle in Ambulatory Subjects Monitored with Wearable Eye Tracking Glasses</a></h4>

              
                PURPOSE: Wearable tracking glasses record eye movements and fixations as ambulatory subjects navigate their environment. We tested the performance of eye tracking glasses under laboratory and real world conditions, to characterize the vergence behavior of normal individuals engaged in their customary daily pursuits. METHODS: To define the accuracy and variability of the eye tracking glasses, 4 subjects fixated with the head stabilized at a series of distances corresponding to vergence demands of: 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32{degrees}. Then, 10 subjects wore the eye tracking glasses for prolonged periods while carrying out their normal activities. Vergence profiles were compiled for each subject and compared with interpupillary distance. RESULTS: In the laboratory the eye tracking glasses were comparable in accuracy to remote video eye trackers, outputting a mean vergence value within 1{degrees} of demand at all angles except 32{degrees}. In ambulatory subjects the glasses were less accurate, due to tracking interruptions and measurement errors, only partly mitigated by application of data filters. Nonetheless, a useful record of vergence behavior was obtained in every subject. Vergence angle often had a bimodal distribution, reflecting a preponderance of activities at near (mobile phone, computer) or far (driving, walking). Vergence angle was highly correlated with interpupillary distance. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable eye tracking glasses provide a history of vergence angle and the corresponding scene witnessed by ambulatory subjects. They offer insight into the diversity of human ocular motor behavior and may become useful for diagnosis of disorders that affect vergence, such as convergence insufficiency, Parkinson disease, and strabismus.

                Divisive normalization is a canonical neural computation employed for sensory adaptation in vision, olfaction and attention modulation. While Divisive Normalization has been proposed to be an efficient coding algorithm, it remains unclear whether such transformation results in information loss in a dynamic setting. Leveraging a previously proposed general mathematical framework called the Divisive Normalization Processor (DNP), we first show that the DNP circuit describes a wide class of neural circuits as well as phenomenological models including the Linear-Nonlinear cascade model. We then demonstrate both theoretically and computationally that the DNP is an invertible operator that could faithfully represent input information given sufficient output samples.

                Medial nucleus accumbens shell (mNAcSh) is a critical brain region for driving motivated behaviors. Despite this well-established role, the underlying reward processing of individual neurons, circuits and cell-types within mNAcSh remains largely unknown. Here, we leverage deep brain 2-photon calcium imaging through endoscopic lenses to record mNAcSh spiny projection neuron (SPN) ensemble responses to rewards of different preference and to reward-predictive cues across cue-reward learning. Reward responses were found to be heterogeneous and particularly differentiated based on reward preference and cell type. A large subpopulation of reward-excited enkephalinergic SPNs were found to be specifically recruited during consumption of unpreferred rewards. A major enkephalinergic efferent projection from mNAcSh to ventral pallidum (VP) was also found to be recruited to unpreferred rewards and to causally drive low positive reward preference. Enkephalin and dynorphinergic SPNs in mNAcSh distinctly represent rewards of different preference and propagate distinct signals through efferent projections to drive consummatory behavior.

                Mammalian circadian rhythms are coordinated by the master clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Under severe environmental conditions, such as during the harsh winter season for food, certain mammalian species reduce their basal metabolism and thermogenesis, thereby undergoing torpor, a controlled state of hypothermia, which naturally returns to the normothermic state. A long-lasting debate focused on whether the SCN with a temperature-compensated clock remains functional during hypothermia. However, so far, no direct and quantitative evidence has been reported of temperature sensitivity in living SCN neurons. In this study, we performed dual-color fluorescence imaging of clock gene transcriptions and intracellular Ca2+ in mouse SCN neurons, using slices at various temperatures. We demonstrated that the Bmal1 transcription and Ca2+ circadian rhythms persisted at 22{degrees}-28{degrees}, although the two rhythms underwent temporal dissociation at 22{degrees}. Notably, Ca2+, Bmal1, and Per2 rhythms were suspended at 15{degrees}, coupled with a significant Ca2+ increase, and all rhythms were reset by rewarming to 35{degrees}. Upon rewarming, the Ca2+ rhythm showed stable oscillations immediately, whereas the Bmal1 and Per2 rhythms took several days to reach stable oscillations and recover their phase relationship with the Ca2+ rhythm. Taken together, we concluded that SCN neurons remain functional under moderate hypothermic conditions at approximately 22{degrees}-28{degrees} but stop ticking time in deep hypothermia at 15{degrees} and that the rhythms reset after deep hypothermia. These data also indicate that the stable Ca2+ oscillation precedes clock gene transcriptional rhythms in the SCN neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal asymmetries and interactions between dorsal and ventral visual pathways during object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Despite their anatomical and functional distinctions, there is growing evidence that the dorsal and ventral visual pathways interact to support object recognition. However, the exact nature of these interactions remains poorly understood. Is the presence of identity-relevant object information in the dorsal pathway simply a byproduct of ventral input? Or, might the dorsal pathway be a source of input to the ventral pathway for object recognition? In the current study, we used high-density EEG - a technique with high temporal precision and spatial resolution sufficient to distinguish parietal and temporal lobes - to characterize the dynamics of dorsal and ventral pathways during object viewing. Using multivariate analyses, we found that category decoding in the dorsal pathway preceded that in the ventral pathway. Importantly, the dorsal pathway predicted the multivariate responses of the ventral pathway in a time-dependent manner, rather than the other way around. Together, these findings suggest that the dorsal pathway is a critical source of input to the ventral pathway.

                A shared mechanism across species heralds the arrival of self-generated sensations, helping the brain to anticipate, and therefore distinguish, self-generated from externally generated sensations. In mammals, this sensory prediction mechanism is supported by communication within a cortico-ponto-cerebellar-thalamo-cortical loop. Schizophrenia is associated with impaired sensory prediction as well as abnormal structural and functional connections between nodes in this circuit. Despite the pons’ principal role in relaying and processing sensory information passed from the cortex to cerebellum, few studies have examined pons connectivity in schizophrenia.

                Control of neurotransmission efficacy is central to theories of how the brain computes and stores information. Neuromodulators are critical in this problem as they locally influence synaptic strength and can operate on a wide range of time scales. Presynaptic function is heavily influenced by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that in part restrict voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) influx in the active zone. Here, using quantitative analysis of both single bouton Ca2+ influx and exocytosis, we uncovered an unexpected non-linear relationship between the magnitude of action potential driven Ca2+ influx and the concentration of external Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e). We find that this unexpected relationship is leveraged by neuromodulator signaling when operating at the nominal physiological set point for [Ca2+]e, 1.2 mM, to achieve complete silencing of nerve terminals. These data imply that the information throughput in neural circuits can be readily modulated in an all-or none fashion at the single synapse level when operating at the physiological set point.

                The co-occurrence of brief ~90 Hz oscillations (co-ripples) may be important in integrating information across the cortex and hippocampus, essential for sleep consolidation, and cognition in general. However, how such co-ripples are synchronized is unknown. We tested if cortico-cortical and hippocampal-cortical ripple co-occurrences are due to the simultaneous direct propagation of thalamic ripples, or if they are instead facilitated by lower frequency waves. Using human intracranial recordings, we found that ripples are generated in the thalamus during non-rapid eye movement sleep with similar characteristics as cortical and hippocampal ripples. However, thalamic ripples only infrequently and weakly co-occur, and never phase-lock, with cortical and hippocampal ripples. In contrast, thalamo-cortical spindles and upstates strongly facilitated cortico-cortical and hippocampo-cortical co-rippling. Thus, while thalamic ripples may not directly drive multiple cortical or hippocampal sites at ripple frequency, these sites may ripple synchronously in response to widespread activation from thalamo-cortical spindles and upstates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal damage causes retrograde amnesia for objects' visual, but not odour, properties</a></h4>

              
                Damage to the hippocampus produces profound retrograde amnesia, but odour and object discrimination memories can be spared in the retrograde direction following hippocampal damage. Prior lesion studies testing retrograde amnesia for object/odour discriminations are problematic due to sparing of large parts of the hippocampus, which may support memory recall, and/or the presence of uncontrolled, distinctive odours that may support object discrimination. To address these issues, we used a simple object discrimination test to assess memory in rats. Two visually distinct objects, paired with distinct odour cues, were presented to the rats. One object was associated with a reward. Following training, neurotoxic hippocampal lesions were made using N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The rats were then tested on the preoperatively learned object discrimination problem, with and without the availability of odour or visual cues during testing. The rats were also postoperatively trained on a new object discrimination problem. Lesion sizes ranged from 67-97% of the hippocampus, with an average of 87%. On the preoperatively learned discrimination problem, the rats with hippocampal lesions showed preserved object discrimination memory when tested in the dark (i.e., without visual cues) but not when the explicit odour cues were removed from the objects. Hippocampal lesions did not cause anterograde amnesia for the postoperatively learned object discrimination problem. Our results support the idea that long-term memories for odours, unlike recall of visual properties of objects, does not depend on the hippocampus in rats, consistent with previous observations that hippocampal damage does not cause retrograde amnesia for odour memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of neuronal OFF periods as low amplitude neural activity segments</a></h4>

              
                During non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), synchronised neuronal activity is reflected in a specific neural oscillation observed in neocortical electrophysiological signals: a low frequency component characterised by depth-positive/surface-negative potentials known as slow waves, corresponding to alternating periods of high (ON period) and low (OFF period) spiking activity. Often overlooked in favour of slow waves, there is an interest in understanding how neuronal silencing during OFF periods leads to the generation of slow waves and whether this relationship changes between cortical layers. The foremost issue in detecting population OFF periods is the absence of a formal, widely adopted definition. Here, we grouped segments of high frequency neural activity containing spikes, recorded from the neocortex, on the basis of amplitude and asked whether the population of low amplitude (LA) segments displayed the expected characteristics of OFF periods. We corroborate previous studies showing that low amplitude segments in neural activity signals are a uniquely identifiable structure with distinct characteristics from the surrounding signal spiking that identify them as OFF periods including NREM sleep predominance and association with a local field potential (LFP) slow wave. In addition, we attribute new characteristics to these segments not previously associated with OFF periods: vigilance-state-dependent duration and duration-dependent homeostatic response. This could suggest that ON/OFF periods are currently underdefined, and their appearance is less binary than previously considered, instead representing a continuum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Which visual working memory model accounts best for target representation in the attentional blink?</a></h4>

              
                People often fail to detect the second of two targets when there is a short time interval of ~500 msec or less between them. This phenomenon is known as the attentional blink (AB). Accumulating evidence suggests that the AB is a result of a failure to select and consolidate the second target in working memory. The current literature has assumed that the standard mixture model of visual working memory (VWM) explains representation in the AB better than resource-based VWM models. However, no existing study has systematically compared VWM models in the AB domain. Here, we present a comparison of eight widely-used VWM models in four different AB datasets from three separate laboratories. We fitted each model and computed the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values at an individual level, across different conditions and experiments, based on which we compared the models by their average model ranks. We found that, for most experiments presented here, the standard mixture model, the slot model, and their variants do outperform the others. We nevertheless also observed that certain details, such as the stimuli or spatial arrangement of targets used in the AB task, can result in different model rankings. Our results can help researchers to select the best model for their AB studies in the future, and thereby gain a better understanding of their data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contextual influences of visual perceptual inferences</a></h4>

              
                Humans have well-documented priors for many features present in nature that guide visual perception. Despite being putatively grounded in the statistical regularities of the environment, scene priors are frequently violated due to the inherent variability of visual features from one scene to the next. However, these repeated violations do not appreciably challenge visuo-cognitive function, necessitating the broad use of priors in conjunction with context-specific information. We investigated the trade-off between participants' internal expectations formed from both longer-term priors and those formed from immediate contextual information using a perceptual inference task and naturalistic stimuli. Notably, our task required participants to make perceptual inferences about naturalistic images using their own internal criteria, rather than making comparative judgements. Nonetheless, we show that observers' performance is well approximated by a model that makes inferences using a prior for low-level image statistics, aggregated over many images. We further show that the dependence on this prior is rapidly re-weighted against contextual information, whether relevant or irrelevant. Our results therefore provide insight into how apparent high-level interpretations of scene appearances follow from the most basic of perceptual processes, which are grounded in the statistics of natural images.

                Mammalian hippocampal circuits undergo extensive remodeling through adult neurogenesis. While this process has been widely studied, the specific contribution of adult-born granule cells (aGCs) to spatial operations in the hippocampus remains unknown. Here we show that optogenetic activation of 4-week-old (young) aGCs in free-foraging mice produces a non-reversible reconfiguration of spatial maps in proximal CA3, while rarely evoking neural activity. Stimulation of the same neuronal cohort on subsequent days recruits CA3 neurons with increased efficacy but fails to induce further remapping. In contrast, stimulation of 8-week-old (mature) aGCs can reliably activate CA3 cells but produce no alterations in spatial maps. Our results reveal a unique role of young aGCs in remodeling CA3 representations, a potential that can be depleated and is lost with maturation. This ability could contribute to generate orthogonalized downstream codes supporting pattern separation.

                The nervous system processes sensory information by relying on the precise coordination of neuronal networks and their specific synaptic firing patterns. In the spinal cord, disturbances to the firing pattern of the tonic firing parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneuron (PV neurons) disrupt the ability of the dorsal horn to integrate touch information and may result in pathological phenotypes. The parvalbumin protein (PVp) is a calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein that buffers the accumulation of Ca2+ following a train of action potential to allow for tonic firing. Here, we find that peripheral nerve injury causes a decrease in PVp expression in PV neurons and makes them transition from tonic to adaptive firing. We also show that reducing the expression of PVp causes otherwise healthy adult mice to develop mechanical allodynia and causes their PV neurons to lose their high frequency firing pattern. We show that this frequency adaptation is mediated by activation of SK channels on PV neurons. Further, we show their tonic firing can be partially restored after nerve injury by selectively inhibiting the SK2 channels of PV neurons. We also reveal that a decrease in the transcriptional coactivator, PGC-1 causes decrease PVp expression and the development of mechanical allodynia. By preventing the decrease in PVp expression before nerve injury, we were able to protect mice from developing mechanical allodynia. Our results indicate an essential role for PVp-mediated calcium buffering in PV neuron firing activity and the development of mechanical allodynia after nerve injury.

                Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) regulates activity-dependent RNA localization and local translation to modulate synaptic plasticity throughout the CNS. Mutations in the FMR1 gene that hinder or ablate FMRP function cause Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a disorder associated with sensory processing dysfunction. FXS pre-mutations are associated with increased FMRP expression and neurological impairments including sex dimorphic presentations of chronic pain. In mice, FMRP ablation causes dysregulated DRG neuron excitability and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, spinal circuit activity, and decreased translation-dependent nociceptive sensitization. Activity-dependent, local translation is a key mechanism for enhancing primary nociceptor excitability which promotes pain in animals and humans. These works indicate that FMRP likely regulates nociception and pain at the level of the primary nociceptor or spinal cord. Therefore, we sought to better understand FMRP expression in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord using immunostaining in organ donor tissues. We find that FMRP is highly expressed in DRG and spinal neuron subsets with substantia gelatinosa exhibiting the most abundant immunoreactivity in spinal synaptic fields. Here, it is expressed in nociceptor axons. FMRP puncta colocalized with Nav1.7 and TRPV1 receptor signals suggesting a pool of axoplasmic FMRP localizes to plasma membrane-associated loci in these branches. Interestingly, FMRP puncta exhibited notable colocalization with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity selectively in female spinal cord. Our results support a regulatory role for FMRP in human nociceptor axons of the dorsal horn and implicate it in the sex dimorphic actions of CGRP signaling in nociceptive sensitization and chronic pain.

                Interest has always been an important research object in the field of education. Moreover, understanding the role of interest in students' classroom learning is conducive to teaching practices. By constructing a theoretical model of interest based on relevant theories and prior empirical evidence, this study examined the differences within research paradigms and explored the potential function of neurophysiological signals in representing students' interest in learning. In both laboratory and naturalistic paradigms, self-reporting and neurophysiological data were collected from 10th graders of an urban secondary school in Beijing, China. Through the data-driven approach of machine learning, the neurophysiological data were employed to fit self-reporting situational interest, and relevant theoretical models were examined based on all data using structural equation modeling. The path coefficients in the models were subsequently compared to determine the similarities and differences between the two paradigms. Combined with the results of multiple linear regressions established via machine learning, this study demonstrates the ability of neurophysiological data to represent situational interest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain glucose metabolism and ageing: A 5-year longitudinal study in a large PET cohort</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ageing and clinical factors impact brain glucose metabolism. However, there is a substantial variation of the reported effects on brain glucose metabolism across studies due to the limited statistical power and cross-sectional study designs. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 441 healthy males (mean 42.8, range 38-50 years) who underwent health check-up program twice at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Health check-up program included 1) brain 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), 2) anthropometric and body composition measurements, 3) blood samples, and 4) questionnaires for stress and depression. After spatial normalization of brain FDG PET scans, standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was measured from 12 region-of-interests. We used hierarchical clustering analysis to reduce their dimensionality before the Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Five clusters were established for predicting regional SUVR; 1) metabolic cluster (body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, fat percentage, muscle percentage, homeostatic model assessment index-insulin resistance), 2) blood pressure (systolic, diastolic), 3) glucose (fasting plasma glucose level, HbA1c), 4): psychological cluster (stress, depression), and 5) heart rate. The effects of clinical variable clusters on regional SUVR were investigated using Bayesian hierarchical modelling with brms that applies the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling tools. Results: All the clinical variables except depression changed during the 5-year follow-up. SUVR decreased in caudate, cingulate, frontal lobe and parietal lobe and increased in cerebellum, hippocampus, occipital lobe, pallidum, putamen, temporal lobe and thalamus. SUVRs of thalamus, pallidum, hippocampus, putamen and parietal lobe were negatively associated with metabolic cluster and the effects of glucose on SUVRs varied across regions. SUVRs of thalamus, hippocampus, cingulate, cerebellum increased and those with occipital lobe decreased with heart rate. The effects of blood pressure and psychological cluster markedly overlapped with zero across regions. Conclusion: Regionally selective decline in brain glucose utilization begins already in the middle age, while individual differences in brain glucose metabolism remain stable. In addition to ageing, brain glucose utilization is also associated with metabolic cluster, blood glucose levels and heart rate. These effects are also consistent over the studied period of 5 years in the middle adulthood.

                Vestibular inputs from the inner ear are at the basis of the vestibulo-spinal and vestibulocollic reflexes involved in balance control. Studies have focused on how attentional load and emotions influence balance, but low-level social cues, such as observing human bodies in motion, have been neglected. Yet, individuals observing another person in a challenging posture or in motion can experience imbalance, indicating that sensorimotor resonance between self and others is involved. The present study examines how the observation of videos depicting human bodies in motion modulates well-established neurophysiological signatures of vestibular information processing. The excitability of vestibulocollic reflexes was assessed by analyzing the waveform of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) over the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles of 25 healthy participants (13 females, 12 males). Here we show that observing human bodies undergoing passive whole-body rotations reduced the VEMPs amplitude when compared to observing an object. Importantly, the modulation depended on the person depicted in the video as VEMPs were reduced when observing oneself, compared to someone else being moved. Direction-specific effects and electromyography recordings ruled out non-specific emotional and attentional effects. These results show that the vestibular system is sensitive to observing human bodies in motion, establishing new connections between social neuroscience and vestibular neurophysiology.

                A changing environment may suddenly require some parts of a multi-component response to be cancelled, while others continue. Such partial cancellation consistently produces a behavioural delay in the remaining component. This delay may reflect a three-step process of non-selective neural inhibition of all response components, functional uncoupling of components, and selective initiation of the remaining response. However, most neurophysiological evidence supporting this hypothesis has been recorded from muscles of a single hand, without direct comparison between response components. We aimed to simultaneously record - and therefore directly compare - corticomotor excitability (CME) in the cancelled and responding hands using a dual-coil technique not yet applied in this context. Human participants received transcranial magnetic stimulation to both primary motor cortices 1ms apart while performing a bimanual response inhibition task. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from both first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles as a measure of CME during partial cancellation. An equivalent reduction in CME was evident for both the responding and cancelled FDI muscles 175 ms after the stop cue during successful partial cancellation. The responding FDI subsequently exhibited an increase in CME above levels in the cancelled hand, leading to the unimanual response. This study reveals, for the first time, the temporal dynamics of CME for both response components simultaneously during a bimanual response inhibition task. Our results provide strong evidence that neural modulation during sudden partial cancellation can be viewed in light of the stop-change framework as a sequential non-selective stop, uncouple and switch, then selectively go process.

                The depth at which parafoveal words are processed during reading is an ongoing topic of debate. Recent studies using the RSVP-with-flanker paradigms have shown that a semantically implausible word in a sentence elicits a more negative N400 component than a plausible one already before the word enters foveal vision. While this finding suggests that word meaning can is accessed in parafoveal vision and used to rapidly update the sentence representation, evidence of similar effects in natural reading situations is still scarce. In the present study, we combined the co-registration of eye movements and EEG with the deconvolution modeling of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to test whether semantic plausibility is processed parafoveally during natural Chinese sentence reading. For one target word per sentence, both its parafoveal and foveal plausibility were orthogonally manipulated using the boundary paradigm. Consistent with previous eye movement studies, we observed a delayed effect of parafoveal plausibility on fixation durations that only emerged on the foveal word. Crucially, in FRPs aligned to the pre-target fixation, a clear N400 effect emerged already based on parafoveal plausibility, with more negative voltages for implausible previews. Once participants fixated the target, we again observed an N400 effect of foveal plausibility. Interestingly, this foveal N400 effect was absent whenever the preview had been implausible, indicating that when a word's (im)plausibility is processed in parafoveal vision, this information is not revised anymore upon direct fixation. Our results provide convergent neural and behavioral evidence for the parafoveal processing of semantic information in natural reading.

                Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia have overlapping neurologic symptoms particularly disabling fatigue. This has given rise to the question whether they are distinct central nervous system (CNS) entities or is one an extension of the other. To investigate this, we used unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to examine the most proximal fluid to the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This was to ascertain if the proteome profile of one was the same or different from the other. We examined two separate groups of ME/CFS, one with (n=15) and one without (n=15) fibromyalgia. We quantified a total of 2,083 proteins using immunoaffinity depletion, tandem mass tag isobaric labeling and offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, including 1,789 that were quantified in all the CSF samples. ANOVA analysis did not yield any proteins with an adjusted p-value < 0.05. This supports the notion that ME/CFS and fibromyalgia as currently defined are not distinct entities

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception and Memory Retrieval States are Reflected in Distributed Patterns of Background Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The same visual input can serve as the target of perception or as a trigger for memory retrieval depending on whether cognitive processing is externally oriented (perception) or internally oriented (memory retrieval). While numerous human neuroimaging studies have characterized how visual stimuli are differentially processed during perception versus memory retrieval, perception and memory retrieval may also be associated with distinct neural states that are independent of stimulus-evoked neural activity. Here, we combined human fMRI with full correlation matrix analysis (FCMA) to reveal potential differences in "background" functional connectivity across perception and memory retrieval states. We found that perception and retrieval states could be discriminated with high accuracy based on patterns of connectivity across (1) the control network, (2) the default mode network (DMN), and (3) retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Clusters in the control network increased connectivity with each other during the perception state, whereas clusters in the DMN were more strongly coupled during the retrieval state. Interestingly, RSC switched its coupling between networks as the cognitive state shifted from retrieval to perception. Finally, we show that background connectivity captured distinct cognitive aspects compared to traditional classification of stimulus-evoked responses. Together, our results reveal that perception and memory retrieval are associated with sustained cognitive states that manifest as distinct patterns of connectivity among large-scale brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improving 3D Edge Detection for Visual Inspection of MRI Coregistration and Alignment</a></h4>

              
                Detecting and visualizing edges is important in several neuroimaging and medical imaging applications. For example, it is common to use edge maps to ensure the automatic alignment of low-resolution functional MRI images to match a high-resolution structural image has been successful. Specifically, software toolboxes like FSL and AFNI generate volumetric edge maps that can be particularly useful for visually assessing the alignment of datasets, overlaying the edge map of one on the other. Therefore, edge maps play a crucial role in quality assurance. Popular methods for computing edges are based on either the first derivative of the image as in FSL, or a variation of the Canny Edge detection method as implemented in AFNI. The crucial algorithmic parameter for adjustment for each of these methods relates to the image intensity. However, image intensity is relative and can be quite variable in most neuroimaging modalities. Further, the existing approaches do not necessarily generate a closed edge/surface, which can reduce the ability to determine the correspondence between a represented edge and another image. We suggest that using the second derivative (difference of Gaussian, or DoG) of the image to generate edges resolves both these issues. This method primarily operates by specifying a spatial scale of interest (which is typically known in medical imaging) rather than a contrast scale, and creates closed surfaces by definition. We describe some convenient implementation features (for both efficiency and visual quality) developed here, and we provide open source implementations of this method as both online and high performance portable code. Finally, we include this method as part of both the AFNI and FSL software packages.

                Discovering how neural computations are implemented in the cortex at the level of monosynaptic connectivity requires probing for the existence of synapses from possibly thousands of presynaptic candidate neurons. Two-photon optogenetics has been shown to be a promising technology for mapping such monosynaptic connections via serial stimulation of neurons with single-cell resolution. However, this approach is limited in its ability to uncover connectivity at large scales because stimulating neurons one-by-one requires prohibitively long experiments. Here we developed novel computational tools that, when combined, enable learning of monosynaptic connectivity from high-speed holographic neural ensemble stimulation. First, we developed a model-based compressed sensing algorithm that identifies connections from postsynaptic responses evoked by stimulation of many neurons at once, considerably increasing the rate at which the existence and strength of synapses are screened. Second, we developed a deep learning method that isolates the postsynaptic response evoked by each stimulus, allowing stimulation to rapidly switch between ensembles without waiting for the postsynaptic response to return to baseline. Together, our system increases the throughput of monosynaptic connectivity mapping by an order of magnitude over existing approaches, enabling the acquisition of connectivity maps at speeds needed to discover the synaptic circuitry implementing neural computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity across the human subcortical auditory system using a Gaussian copula graphical model approach with partial correlations</a></h4>

              
                The central auditory system is comprised of multiple subcortical brain structures that sequentially process and refine incoming acoustic signals along the primary auditory pathway. Due to the technical limitations of imaging small structures deep inside the brain, most of our knowledge of the subcortical auditory system is based on research in animal models using invasive methodologies. While recent advances in ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition have enabled novel investigations of the human subcortex non-invasively, optimal approaches to assessing functional activation and connectivity are still being developed. Traditionally, functional connectivity using fMRI data is estimated with simple correlation matrices. Partial correlations however reveal the connectivity between two regions after removing the effects of all other regions and hence are often more meaningful. Partial correlation analysis is particularly promising in the subcortical auditory system, where sensory information is passed serially from nucleus to nucleus up the primary auditory pathway, providing redundant but also increasingly abstract representations of auditory stimuli (Chechik and Nelken, 2012). In this project, we developed and implemented a Gaussian copula graphical model (GCGM) approach to estimate the partial correlations and thereby infer the functional connectivity patterns within the auditory system. Given the paucity of non-invasive methods for human subcortical investigations, we aim to unveil novel information about the hierarchy and direct connections throughout the human subcortical auditory system. Our results show strong positive partial correlations between contralateral structures throughout the auditory system, particularly in the auditory midbrain and thalamus. We also found positive partial correlations between successive structures in the auditory pathway on each side (left and right), including between auditory midbrain and thalamus, and between primary and associative auditory cortex. Further, we confirmed that these connectivity estimates were unique to the auditory system, as non-auditory regions included as controls - namely, visual cortex and superior frontal cortex - were strongly connected to their contralateral homologues but only minimally connected with auditory brain regions. Additionally, these results were highly stable when splitting the data in half according to the acquisition schemes and computing partial correlations separately for each half of the data, as well as across cross-validation folds. Overall, these results demonstrate that unique functional connectivity patterns along the auditory pathway are recoverable using novel connectivity approaches and that our connectivity methods are reliable across multiple acquisitions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute hyper- and hypoglycemia uncouples the metabolic cooperation between glucose and lactate to disrupt sleep</a></h4>

              
                The sleep-wake cycle is a master regulator of metabolic and neuronal activity and when altered, can have profound effects on metabolic health and disease. Although consideration is given to how fluctuations in blood glucose affect peripheral physiology and metabolism, less is known about how glucose dysregulation impacts the intrinsic cooperation between brain metabolism and neuronal activity to regulate sleep. To understand the effect of peripheral hyper- and hypoglycemia on these relationships, we paired biosensors measuring hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) levels of glucose and lactate with cortical EEG/EMG recordings to produce simultaneous sub second recordings of ISF glucose, lactate, and sleep-wake states. First, we describe a conserved temporal relationships between ISF glucose and lactate based on their intrinsic oscillations, diurnal rhythms, and sleep/wake cycles. ISF glucose and lactate oscillations are largely anti-correlated but the frequency of their oscillations dictate their power, coherence, and phase. While ISF glucose and lactate both have diurnal fluctuations, only ISF lactate is consistently elevated during wake. During wake, fluctuations in ISF lactate are associated with changes in the EEG power spectrum, suggesting wake-related activity is more closely associated with ISF lactate. Modulation of glucose availability via both hyper- or hypoglycemia disrupts the relationship between peripheral metabolism, brain metabolism, and sleep. Hyper- and hypo-glycemia increase ISF lactate, decrease NREM, and alter EEG spectral activity, again demonstrating ISF lactate drives wake-associated behaviors and disrupts sleep. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that peripheral glucose homeostasis is necessary for maintaining the relationships between brain metabolism, neuronal activity, and sleep-wake patterns and deviations in blood glucose levels are sufficient to disrupt the metabolic signature of sleep-wake states, putting the brain at risk in diseases like type-2-diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of social presence on behavioural, neural and physiological aspects of empathy for pain</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are rich in cues about others' mental and emotional states, and these cues have been shown to facilitate empathy. As more and more social interactions shift from direct to mediated interactions with reduced social cues, it's possible that empathy is affected. We tested whether behavioural, neural and physiological aspects of empathy for pain are reduced in a video-mediated interaction. To this end, 30 human participants (23 females, 7 males) observed one of 5 targets (all female) undergoing painful electric stimulation, once in a direct interaction and once in a live, video-mediated interaction (within-subject design) while EEG was measured. On a behavioural level, we found that observers were as accurate in judging others' pain via video as in a direct encounter and reported the same level of distress. On the neural and physiological levels, the theta response to others' pain and skin conductance coupling in the dyad were reduced in the mediated condition. Other measures, including mu suppression (a common marker of pain empathy), were not affected by condition. To conclude, a video-mediated interaction did not impair the cognitive aspects of empathy for pain, i.e., understanding the other accurately. However, the reduced theta response and reduced skin conductance coupling suggest that physical proximity with its rich social cues is important for other stimulus-driven physiological responses that may be related to resonance with the other's experience. Our results encourage more research on the role of social presence for different empathy components.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabotropic glutamate group II receptor activation in the dorsal striatum suppresses the motivation for cocaine in rats</a></h4>

              
                After a history of intermittent cocaine intake, rats develop patterns of drug use characteristic of addiction. The dorsal striatum is involved in the increased pursuit of cocaine after intermittent drug self-administration experience. Within the dorsal striatum, chronic cocaine use changes metabotropic glutamate type II receptor (mGlu2/3) density and function. We examined the extent to which activity at these receptors mediates responding for cocaine after intermittent cocaine use. In Experiment 1, male Wistar rats (n = 11) self-administered 0.25 mg/kg/infusion cocaine during 10 daily intermittent access (IntA) sessions (5 min ON/25 min OFF, for 5 h/session). We then examined the effects of intra-dorsal striatum infusions of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 (0, 1, and 3 g/hemisphere) on cocaine self-administration under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. We observed a non-significant tendency for LY379268 to reduce responding for cocaine. In Experiment 2, we used a larger sample of male (n = 11) and female (n = 10) rats. Across 10 IntA sessions, the sexes showed similar levels of cocaine intake. Across the sexes, locomotion significantly increased over sessions, suggesting that rats developed psychomotor sensitization to self-administered cocaine. After 10 IntA sessions, intra-dorsal striatum LY379268 significantly reduced breakpoints achieved for cocaine, active lever presses, and cocaine infusions earned under progressive ratio. LY379268 had no effects on locomotion or inactive lever presses, indicating no motor effects. These results suggest that mGlu2/3 receptor activation in the dorsal striatum suppresses incentive motivation for cocaine, and this holds promise for anti-addiction therapeutics.

                Peripheral sensory organ damage leads to compensatory cortical plasticity that supports a remarkable recovery of perceptual capabilities. A major knowledge gap is the lack of precise mechanisms that explain how this plasticity is implemented and distributed over a diverse collection of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Here, we explored these mechanisms in mouse A1. After peripheral damage, we found recovered sound-evoked activity of excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and parvalbumin (PVs) interneurons (INs), reduced activity in somatostatin-INs (SOMs), and recovered activity in vasoactive intestinal peptide-INs (VIPs). Given the sequentially organized cortical network where VIPs inhibit INs, SOMs inhibit PVs and PNs, and PVs inhibit PNs, our results suggest that PVs contribute to PN stability, SOMs allow for increased PN and PV activity, and VIPs enable the PN and PV recovery by inhibiting SOMs. These results highlight a strategic, cooperative, and cell-type-specific plasticity program that restores cortical sound processing after peripheral damage.

                Astrocytes play crucial roles in regulating neural circuit function by forming a dense network of synapse-associated membrane specializations. Intimate astrocyte-synapse contact is thought to be crucial for astrocyte function, yet signaling pathways regulating astrocyte morphogenesis remain poorly defined. Here we show the Drosophila lipid-binding G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Tre1, likely acting through Rac1, is required for astrocytes to elaborate their complex morphologies. The lipid phosphate phosphatases Wunen/Wunen2, which process phospholipid ligands for Tre1, also regulate astrocyte growth, and act upstream of Tre1 as Wunen/Wunen2-mediated astrocyte overgrowth is suppressed by Tre1 loss. Loss of s1pr1, the functional analog of Tre1 in zebrafish, also leads to disruption of astrocyte morphogenesis. Live-imaging and pharmacology demonstrate that S1pr1 balances proper astrocyte process extension/retraction dynamics during morphogenesis, and that S1pr1 signaling is required throughout astrocyte development. Our work identifies lipid-binding GPCRs like Tre1 and S1pr1 as potent evolutionarily conserved regulators of astrocyte morphological complexity.

                The impact of CNS disorders is exacerbated by the difficulty in developing safe, effective glutamatergic therapeutics. Synaptic glutamate transmission is vital for neural physiology throughout the brain, which contributes to the vast therapeutic potential and safety risk of glutamatergic therapeutics. Here, we created a genetically modified rat (MSxc) to survey the range of brain functions impacted by the loss of glutamate release from astrocytes involving system xc- (Sxc). Eliminating Sxc activity was not lethal and did not alter growth patterns, activity states, novel object recognition or performance of other simple tasks. In contrast, MSxc rats differed from WT in Pavlovian Conditioned Approach and cocaine self-administration/reinstatement paradigms. Both WT and MSxc rats readily learned that a cue predicted food delivery during Pavlovian Conditioned Approach training. However, WT rats were more likely to approach the food tray (i.e., goal tracking) whereas MSxc rats were more likely to approach the food-predicted cue (i.e., sign tracking) even when this behavior was punished. In the self-administration/reinstatement paradigm, MSxc rats had higher levels of cocaine-primed drug seeking in the absence of altered extinction or cocaine self-administration. These data demonstrate that Sxc-mediated glutamate release from astrocytes regulates non-reinforced and negative-outcome behaviors without altering simple learning or other forms of basic brain function.

                The effects of aging on the brain can be studied by examining the changes in complexity of brain signals and fluid cognitive abilities. This paper is a relatively large-scale study in which the complexity of the resting-state MEG (rsMEG) signal was investigated in 602 healthy participants (298 females and 304 males) aged 18 to 87. In order to quantify the brain signals' complexity, the multiscale entropy is applied. This study investigates the relationship between age and fluid intelligence with brain complexity and the variations of the complexity asymmetry between the left-right brain hemispheres across the life span. In the analysis of the brain signals, the gender difference was considered. The results showed that the complexity of rsMEG decreases across the lifespan. However, the complexity difference between the left-right brain hemispheres positively correlates with age. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that fluid intelligence and age have a positive correlation. Finally, the frequency analysis revealed a significant increase in the relative power of low and high gamma rhythms in females compared to males in all age groups.

                Genetic variants affecting Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) have been identified in several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); however, the role of HNRNPU in human neural development and NDDs remains to be studied. Here, we describe the molecular and cellular outcomes of HNRNPU deficiency during in vitro neural differentiation of isogenic and patient-derived neuroepithelial stem cells. We demonstrate that HNRNPU deficiency leads to chromatin remodeling of A/B compartments, and transcriptional rewiring, partly by impacting exon inclusion during mRNA processing. Genomic regions affected by the chromatin restructuring and host genes of exon usage differences show a strong enrichment for genes implicated in epilepsies, intellectual disability, and autism. Lastly, we show the effects of the molecular reorganization at the cellular level, where HNRNPU downregulation leads to altered neurogenesis and an increased fraction of neural progenitors marked in the maturing neuronal population. We conclude that HNRNPU deficiency is responsible for the delayed commitment of neural progenitors to neuronal maturation, ultimately leading to altered neurogenesis.

                How communication between neurons gives rise to natural vision remains a matter of intense investigation. The mid-level visual areas along the ventral stream, as studies in primates have shown, are selective to a common class of natural images - textures - but a circuit-level understanding of this selectivity and its link to perception remain unclear. We addressed these questions in mice, first showing that they can perceptually discriminate between texture types and statistically simpler spectrally matched stimuli. Then, at the neural level, we found that the secondary visual area (LM), more than the primary one (V1), was selective for the higher-order statistics of textures, both at the mesoscopic and single-cell levels. At the circuit level, textures were encoded in neural activity subspaces whose relative distances correlated with the statistical complexity of the images and with the ability of mice to discriminate between them. These dependencies were more significant in LM, in which the texture-related subspaces were smaller and closer to each other, enabling better stimulus decoding in this area. Together, our results demonstrate texture vision in mice, finding a linking framework between stimulus statistics, neural representations, and perceptual sensitivity - a distinct hallmark of efficient coding computations.

	<p>Background: This work aims to describe the clinico-radiological phenotype of UBTF c.628G&amp;amp;gt;A (p.Glu210Lys) pathogenic variant-related neurodegeneration in childhood. Methods: We describe the progress of clinical and neuroimaging features in a male individual who had childhood-onset neuroregression and carried the heterozygous UBTF c.628G&amp;amp;gt;A (p.Glu210Lys) pathogenic variant. Clinical cases reported in the literature are reviewed. Results: Fifteen individuals, from 14 reported cases and the index case, were noted. The median age at onset of neurodegeneration was 3 years. Clinical phenotype was consistent among the affected individuals, with progressive motor, speech, cognitive, and social&amp;amp;ndash;emotional regression together with ataxia and prominent pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms and signs in early to middle childhood. All individuals had the same brain MRI features in terms of symmetric and diffuse T2 high signal intensity over the bilateral subcortical, periventricular, and peritrigonal white matter and progressive cortical and subcortical supratentorial atrophy. Two individuals were reported to have bilateral thalamic involvement. All individuals had profound intellectual disability with loss of verbal and/or ambulatory functions during follow-up. Conclusions: Individuals with the heterozygous UBTF c.628G&amp;amp;gt;A (p.Glu210Lys) pathogenic variant had consistent clinical progress and neuroimaging features. Familiarity with this clinico-radiological phenotype may allow earlier diagnosis of this rare disease.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is related to abnormal brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns. However, little is known about its relationship with dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) based on the assumption that brain FCs fluctuate over time. Temporal stabilities of dFCs within the whole brain and nine key networks were compared between 52 MDD patients and 21 age, sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and temporal correlation coefficients. The alterations in MDD were further correlated with the scores of suicidality item in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Compared with HCs, the MDD patients showed a decreased temporal stability of dFC as indicated by a significantly decreased temporal correlation coefficient at the global level, as well as within the default mode network (DMN) and subcortical network. In addition, temporal correlation coefficients of the DMN were found to be significantly negatively correlated with the HAMD suicidality item scores in MDD patients. These results suggest that MDD may be characterized by excessive temporal fluctuations of dFCs within the DMN and subcortical network, and that decreased stability of DMN connectivity may be particularly associated with the suicidality in MDD.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to discover the effects of robotic rehabilitation utilizing an exoskeletal-type robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) device on patients with ataxic and hemiplegic stroke and to compare its effectiveness between the two groups. This was a retrospective study, and the electronic charts of 22 patients who underwent RAGT treatment from October 2019 to June 2021 were reviewed. Patients were divided into ataxic and hemiplegic groups based on their symptoms. The clinical outcome measures included the Berg balance scale (BBS), functional ambulation category (FAC), and mobility subcategories of the modified Barthel Index (MBI-m). Outcome measures were reviewed at two points within 48 h, before and after RAGT with EXOWALK&amp;amp;reg;, a type of exoskeletal robot. After the RAGT sessions, total patients in both ataxic and hemiplegic groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in BBS (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.005, respectively) and MBI-m (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, p = 0.002, and p = 0.011, respectively). Additionally, FAC after RAGT was significantly improved (p = 0.0056). The regression coefficient of the number of RAGT treatments for BBS changes in the nine subjects was estimated to be 2.45; 3.50 in the ataxic group and 2.26 in the hemiplegic group. The regression coefficient of the number of RAGT treatments for MBI-m changes in the nine subjects was estimated to be 0.16; 4.00 in the ataxic group and &amp;amp;minus;0.52 in the hemiplegic group. Our results suggest that RAGT using an exoskeletal-type robot, EXOWALK&amp;amp;reg;, could be effective for improving walking capacity, balance, and daily activities of life in patients with ataxic and hemiplegic stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving a trial participant information sheet through user testing in British South Asian women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: People from ethnic minorities in the UK have higher rates of mental health problems and are less likely to take part in mental health research. Previous research indicates that participant information sheets (PIS) are complex, and this complexity may impair comprehension more significantly for ethnic minority participants. Improving the readability of patient information can be achieved through user testing. We aimed to improve the readability of a PIS through user testing in an ethnic minority group in an ongoing trial (ROSHNI-2). Methods: An independent groups design was used to test the readability of the ROSHNI-2 PIS among South Asian women. There were two rounds of testing (n=31 women in total). South Asian women were asked to read the original PIS, then find and demonstrate an understanding of 19 key aspects of the trial. Based on the findings from the first round, the PIS was rewritten, redesigned, and retested. Results: Using the original PIS, only 2 of the 19 (11%) questions were found and understood by at least 80% of participants. In the revised PIS, 6 of the 19 (32%) questions were found and understood by at least 80% of participants. Conclusions: User testing and re-writing of a PIS resulted in a higher proportion of participants comprehending important information about a trial. This approach could improve participation in trials among ethnic minority communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence and determinants of obesity among individuals with diabetes in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), both individually or simultaneously, increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of obesity among diabetic individuals in Indonesia. Methods: Data were extracted based on 2018 Indonesian Basic Health Survey (Riset Kesehatan Dasar=RISKESDAS). This study involved all individuals with DM and categorized obesity based on body mass index. After data clearing, this study analyzed 3911 DM subjects of the 33.905 subjects acquired from the 2018 RISKESDAS. The study also observed demographic data, diabetes control parameters, history of hypertension, lipid profiles, and food consumption patterns. These variables were involved in a Chi-square test, and related variables were then involved in the Binary logistic regression to define the independent determinants of obesity among DM subjects. Results: Of the 3911DM subjects included, the study found an obesity prevalence of 32.9%. This study found that female (prevalence odds ratio [POR]=2.15; 95% CI: 1.76-2.62), age 15-44 years (POR=2.46; 95% CI: 1.83-3.33), urban residence (POR=1.49; 95% CI: 1.25-1.77), history of hypertension (POR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.04-1.51), high diastolic blood pressure (POR=1.90; 95% CI: 1.58-2.29), high LDL (POR=1.44; 95% CI: 1.13-1.84), and high triglycerides (POR=1.27; 95% CI: 1.07-1.50) were the risk factor of obesity  among DM subjects; while high HDL (POR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.46-0.78 higher education (POR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.53-0.78) and married (POR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.59-0.90) were protective factors of obesity among DM subjects. Conclusions:. The study concluded that almost one-third of DM subjects in Indonesia were obese. Female, age, urban residence, education level, history of hypertension, diastolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles were all associated with obesity among DM subjects in Indonesia. These findings suggest that monitoring and controlling of related determinants is needed to prevent complications caused by the doubled burden of diabetes and obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dental healthcare providers: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are common in dentistry due to the prolonged static work involved during patient care, making dental health care personnel vulnerable to musculoskeletal complaints. We aimed to pool the prevalence estimates of MSD among various dental healthcare providers, including dentists, dental students, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries. Methods: A systematic search of five databases was performed (Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source). The studies that reported the prevalence of MSD among dental healthcare workers and those written in English were selected. Screening and data extraction were performed by two review authors independently. Discrepencies were resolved by another review author. Risk of bias assessment was done using a nine-item questionnaire developed by Hoy et al. Pooled estimates were calculated using meta-analysis of proportions (random effects model). Results: Among the 3090 publications screened, 234 publications were included for full-text screening. Meta-analysis was performed for 89 estimates from 88 publications. Females showed significantly higher prevalence [OR = 1.42 (95% CI = 1.09–1.84); I2 = 66.02; N = 32]. The analysis yielded a pooled estimate of 78.4% (95% CI = 74.8–82). The meta-regression showed similar prevalence over the years (Coefficient: 0.001; P-value: 0.762). Conclusions: A high prevalence of MSD was noted among dental healthcare providers, with about seven out of ten having experienced MSD in the past. This emphasizes the need for awareness and adoption of appropriate ergonomic postures by dental healthcare providers from early in their careers to minimize work-related MSD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Student teachers' perceptions of the collaborative relationships between universities and inclusive elementary schools in Indonesia [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools has not been maximally practiced. The form of collaboration that universities with inclusive elementary schools have carried out is still limited to the need to complete lecture materials during the semester. There is a gap between the theory and practice obtained by student teachers at universities when they have to teach in inclusive elementary schools. As a result, they have not contributed to solving problems that occur in inclusive elementary schools. The collaborative relationship between inclusive elementary schools and universities directly implies that the success of inclusive education is determined by the competence of student teachers whose lecturers have successfully educated them in order to teach in inclusive elementary schools. Compared to the background that the inclusive education system is developing in Indonesia, the researchers investigated student teachers' perceptions at universities regarding inclusive university-inclusive elementary school collaborative relationships. Methods: During data collection, an online survey and in-depth interviews of student teachers about individual experiences and their ideas about the form of inclusive elementary schools-university partnerships was conducted. The data analysis used was a thematic analysis technique. Result: The result summarizes student teachers' statements, revealed three main themes: provision of inclusive education needs, research, and field practice. The student teachers revealed that the collaborative relationship between universities and inclusive elementary schools is essential in order to develop holistic, inclusive practices in a collaborative partnership based on input-needs, which has a two-way impact or benefit for both parties. Conclusions: Furthermore, collaborative relationships must be in the form of long-term programs, such as continuous assistance, and adaptation to the development of inclusive education through lecture materials. To achieve successful inclusive education in Indonesia, we also recommended that the government make policies on multi-sectoral collaboration in order to support inclusive education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community social responsibility of continued and appropriate use of silver amalgam as dental restorative material in southern India: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: For more than 150 years, dental amalgam (DA) has been popular as a dental restorative material. Yet, many organisations oppose its use due to perceived toxicity and environmental concerns. Hence, this study aimed to explore the continued use of DA from a South Indian dental practitioners’ perspective. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among fifty-two private and public dental practitioners of Udupi district in Southern India. A self‑administered questionnaire was distributed, that involved assessment of their preferences, continuation of use and concerns of using DA as a restorative material. Percentage contribution of each variable was calculated. Preferences for continuation of use of silver amalgam based upon the age, experience and mercury toxicity as a risk factor were analysed using Students-t test and Chi-square test.  Results: The majority of dentists were satisfied (87%) with the results of the DA, found minimal failures (96%) and found DA more economical (89%). More than half (54%) of the participants reported that they would not continue the use of DA owing to mercury toxicity and environmental concerns. Dentists with higher age and longer clinical experience preferred continuation of DA. Conclusions: In spite of satisfaction with DA for its minimal failure, longevity and affordability, the authors found that a majority of practitioners did not prefer its continued usage. This highlights their concerns over mercury toxicity and soft tissue lesions and accentuates their community social responsibility. There is also an urgent need to educate dentists on mercury hygiene, mercury waste management and disposal.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and accurate Ab Initio Protein structure prediction using deep learning potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robin Pearce, Yang Li, Gilbert S. Omenn, Yang Zhang</p>

Despite the immense progress recently witnessed in protein structure prediction, the modeling accuracy for proteins that lack sequence and/or structure homologs remains to be improved. We developed an open-source program, DeepFold, which integrates spatial restraints predicted by multi-task deep residual neural-networks along with a knowledge-based energy function to guide its gradient-descent folding simulations. The results on large-scale benchmark tests showed that DeepFold creates full-length models with accuracy significantly beyond classical folding approaches and other leading deep learning methods. Of particular interest is the modeling performance on the most difficult targets with very few homologous sequences, where DeepFold achieved an average TM-score that was 40.3% higher than trRosetta and 44.9% higher than DMPfold. Furthermore, the folding simulations for DeepFold were 262 times faster than traditional fragment assembly simulations. These results demonstrate the power of accurately predicted deep learning potentials to improve both the accuracy and speed of <i>ab initio</i> protein structure prediction.

                <p>by Juan Ramon Melendez-Alvarez, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

The mutual interactions between the synthetic gene circuits and the host growth could cause unexpected outcomes in the dynamical behaviors of the circuits. However, how the steady states and the stabilities of the gene circuits are affected by host cell growth is not fully understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model for nonlinear growth feedback based on published experimental data. The model analysis predicts that growth feedback could significantly change the qualitative states of the system. Bistability could emerge in a circuit without positive feedback, and high-order multistability (three or more steady states) arises in the self-activation and toggle switch circuits. Our results provide insight into the potential effects of ultrasensitive growth feedback on the emergence of qualitative states in synthetic circuits and the corresponding underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Robust inference of population size histories from genomic sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gautam Upadhya, Matthias Steinrücken</p>

Unraveling the complex demographic histories of natural populations is a central problem in population genetics. Understanding past demographic events is of general anthropological interest, but is also an important step in establishing accurate null models when identifying adaptive or disease-associated genetic variation. An important class of tools for inferring past population size changes from genomic sequence data are Coalescent Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs). These models make efficient use of the linkage information in population genomic datasets by using the local genealogies relating sampled individuals as latent states that evolve along the chromosome in an HMM framework. Extending these models to large sample sizes is challenging, since the number of possible latent states increases rapidly.
Here, we present our method CHIMP (CHMM History-Inference Maximum-Likelihood Procedure), a novel CHMM method for inferring the size history of a population. It can be applied to large samples (hundreds of haplotypes) and only requires unphased genomes as input. The two implementations of CHIMP that we present here use either the height of the genealogical tree (<i>T</i><sub>MRCA</sub>) or the total branch length, respectively, as the latent variable at each position in the genome. The requisite transition and emission probabilities are obtained by numerically solving certain systems of differential equations derived from the ancestral process with recombination. The parameters of the population size history are subsequently inferred using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, we implement a composite likelihood scheme to allow the method to scale to large sample sizes.
We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method in a variety of benchmark tests using simulated data and present comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our implementation using <i>T</i><sub>MRCA</sub> as the latent variable shows comparable performance and provides accurate estimates of effective population sizes in intermediate and ancient times. Our method is agnostic to the phasing of the data, which makes it a promising alternative in scenarios where high quality data is not available, and has potential applications for pseudo-haploid data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Initiation of wound healing is regulated by the convergence of mechanical and epigenetic cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tanay Bhatt, Rakesh Dey, Akshay Hegde, Alhad Ashok Ketkar, Ajai J. Pulianmackal, Ashim P. Deb, Shravanti Rampalli, Colin Jamora</p>

Wound healing in the skin is a complex physiological process that is a product of a cell state transition from homeostasis to repair. Mechanical cues are increasingly being recognized as important regulators of cellular reprogramming, but the mechanism by which it is translated to changes in gene expression and ultimately cellular behavior remains largely a mystery. To probe the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon further, we used the down-regulation of caspase-8 as a biomarker of a cell entering the wound healing program. We found that the wound-induced release of tension within the epidermis leads to the alteration of gene expression via the nuclear translocation of the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a). This enzyme then methylates promoters of genes that are known to be down-regulated in response to wound stimuli as well as potentially novel players in the repair program. Overall, these findings illuminate the convergence of mechanical and epigenetic signaling modules that are important regulators of the transcriptome landscape required to initiate the tissue repair process in the differentiated layers of the epidermis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal diagnosis enables detection of any disease or disability of the fetus during the pregnancy of a woman. Parents whose fetus is found to have a serious disorder from antenatal testing may terminate the pregnancy if it is permitted by the law or continue with the pregnancy to term. However, the chance of terminating a pregnancy may be denied if there is prenatal negligence by the medical practitioner in terms of diagnosis or failure to advise on the test results correctly. The purpose of this research is to examine the possible legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Methods: This study adopts doctrinal legal research in which the researcher examines statutes and decided cases in Malaysia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore relating to abortion, wrongful birth and wrongful life claims, in order to determine the legal implications of prenatal diagnosis in Malaysia. Results: In Malaysia, abortion following a prenatal diagnosis is only legally possible if the statutory criteria in the Penal Code are met. Abortion is illegal if it is not done for therapeutic purposes. A wrongful birth action brought by a woman who claims to be deprived of the opportunity to terminate her pregnancy may be successful in Malaysia, if it can be proven that a legal abortion could have been performed if not because of the prenatal negligence of the medical practitioner. However, a wrongful life action brought in the child’s name for being allowed to be born with a disability may not be viable since the claim could hardly be established and it is against the public policy. Conclusions: Theoretically, it is possible to bring a wrongful birth action resulted from negligence in prenatal diagnosis successfully in Malaysia, but the chance is relatively slim for wrongful life action.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal responses to electrical stimulation of the major input pathways are modulated by dentate spikes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dentate gyrus (DG) is important for pattern separation and spatial memory, and it is thought to gate information flow to the downstream hippocampal subregions. Dentate spikes (DSs) are high-amplitude, fast, positive local-field potential events taking place in the DG during immobility and sleep, and they have been connected to memory consolidation in rodents. DSs are a result of signaling from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the DG, and they suppress firing of pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA1. To study the effects of DSs to signaling in the hippocampal tri-synaptic loop, we electrically stimulated the afferent fibers of the DG, CA3, and CA1 in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats at different delays from DSs. Responses to stimulation were increased in the EC-DG synapse during DSs, and the effect was amplified after theta-burst stimulation. We concluded that DSs strengthen the excitatory signal from the EC to the DG, which is reinforced by synapse potentiation and increased excitability of granule cells after theta-burst stimulation. This signal boosting may function in enhancing plastic changes in the DG-CA3 synapse. As responses in the CA3 and CA1 remained unaffected by the DS, the DS-contingent silencing of pyramidal cells seems to be a result of a decrease in excitatory input rather than a decrease in the excitability of the pyramidal cells themselves. In addition, we found that the DSs occur asynchronously in the left and right hippocampi, giving novel evidence of lateralization of the rodent hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An optimized approach for class imbalance problem in heterogeneous cross project defect prediction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent studies, Cross Project Defect Prediction (CPDP) has proven to be feasible in software defect prediction. When both the source as well as the target projects have the same metric sets, it is termed as a homogeneous CPDP. Current CPDP strategies are difficult to implement through projects with a variety of different metric sets. Aside from that, training data often has a problem with class imbalance. The number of defective/bug-ridden and non-defective/clean instances of the source class is usually unbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous cross-project defect prediction framework that can predict defects across projects with different metric sets. Methods: To construct a prediction framework between projects with heterogeneous metric sets, our heterogeneous cross project defect prediction approach uses metric selection, metric matching, class imbalance (CIB) learning followed by ensemble modelling. For our study, we have considered six open-source object-oriented projects. Results: The proposed model resolved the class imbalance issue and records the highest recall value of 7.5 with f-score value as 7.4 in comparison with other baseline models. The highest AUC (area under curve) value of 0.86 has also been recorded. K fold cross validation was performed to evaluate the training accuracy of the model. The proposed optimized model was validated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (WSR) with a significance level of 5% (i.e., P-value=0.05). Conclusions: Our empirical research on these six projects shows that predictions based on our methodology outperform or are statistically comparable to Within-Project Defect Prediction (WPDP) and other heterogeneous CPDP baseline models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretion and tears in patients with COVID-19 in a tertiary care centre, South India. . [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aims and objectives: Purpose of this study is to detect the presence of SAR-CoV-2 viral RNA in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients and to compare the RT-PCR positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab. Materials and method: Eighty hospitalised COVID-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included in the study. Conjunctival swab was collected from eyes of these patients and sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR method. Results: Among the eighty patients, 51 (63.7%) were males and 29 (36.3%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 55.93 ± 16.59. Six patients had ocular manifestations. Eleven (13.75%) patients tested positive on conjunctival swab for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and only one of them had ocular manifestations out of the eleven. Conclusion: In our study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients was detected and this was not dependent on presence of ocular manifestations or duration of disease. Though the conjunctival positivity is lower compared to the nasopharyngeal swab sampling, ocular surface and secretions can be a potential route of viral transmission.

                Immune synapse formation is a key step for lymphocyte activation. In B lymphocytes, the immune synapse controls the production of high-affinity antibodies, thereby defining the efficiency of humoral immune responses. While the key roles played by both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in the formation and function of the immune synapse have become increasingly clear, how the different events involved in synapse formation are coordinated in space and time by actin-microtubule interactions is not understood. Using a microfluidic pairing device, we studied with unprecedented resolution the dynamics of the various events leading to immune synapse formation and maintenance in murine B cells. Our results identify two groups of events, local and global dominated by actin and microtubules dynamics, respectively. They further highlight an unexpected role for microtubules and the GEF-H1-RhoA axis in restricting F-actin polymerization at the lymphocyte-antigen contact site, thereby allowing the formation and maintenance of a unique competent immune synapse.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural signatures of auditory hypersensitivity following acoustic trauma</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in sensory cortex exhibit a remarkable capacity to maintain stable firing rates despite large fluctuations in afferent activity levels. However, sudden peripheral deafferentation in adulthood can trigger an excessive, non-homeostatic cortical compensatory response that may underlie perceptual disorders including sensory hypersensitivity, phantom limb pain, and tinnitus. Here, we show that mice with noise-induced damage of the high-frequency cochlear base were behaviorally hypersensitive to spared mid-frequency tones and to direct optogenetic stimulation of auditory thalamocortical neurons. Chronic 2-photon calcium imaging from ACtx pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) revealed an initial stage of spatially diffuse hyperactivity, hyper-correlation, and auditory hyperresponsivity that consolidated around deafferented map regions three or more days after acoustic trauma. Deafferented PyrN ensembles also displayed hypersensitive decoding of spared mid-frequency tones that mirrored behavioral hypersensitivity, suggesting that non-homeostatic regulation of cortical sound intensity coding following sensorineural loss may be an underlying source of auditory hypersensitivity. Excess cortical response gain after acoustic trauma was expressed heterogeneously among individual PyrNs, yet 40% of this variability could be accounted for by each cell's baseline response properties prior to acoustic trauma. PyrNs with initially high spontaneous activity and gradual monotonic intensity growth functions were more likely to exhibit non-homeostatic excess gain after acoustic trauma. This suggests that while cortical gain changes are triggered by reduced bottom-up afferent input, their subsequent stabilization is also shaped by their local circuit milieu, where indicators of reduced inhibition can presage pathological hyperactivity following sensorineural hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Photonic hyperthermia of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors at the third near-infrared biowindow</a></h4>

              
                Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), as typical aggressive sarcomas, typically carry a dismal prognosis. Given the insensitivity of these tumors to traditional chemotherapy and the absence of effective targeted drugs, new therapeutic strategies for efficient MPNSTs treatment are urgently needed. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated significant potential in cancer theranostics due to its minimally invasive nature and excellent therapeutic outcomes. However, the passive utilization of photothermal agents (PTAs) with poor target specificity and biocompatibility substantially hinders the clinical translation and application of this method. A unique near-infrared laser at the third biowindow (NIR-III) was utilized for photonic hyperthermia treatment of MPNSTs without PTAs. The superficial locations and relatively high collagen content of MPNSTs ensure the efficiency of photothermal tumor ablation and make the NIR-III laser a suitable therapeutic option that has potential for use in clinical applications. Using human MPNST cell line and xenograft models, it can be found that although the NIR-III photothermal treatment efficiency varied among individuals, which was possibly influenced by different endoplasmic reticulum stress responses (ERSRs), the expected antineoplastic effect was ultimately achieved after adjustment of the power density and radiation duration. The present study provides an intriguing noninvasive therapy for MPNSTs that accelerates the clinical translation of PTT while avoiding the biocompatibility issues arising from PTAs.

                <b>Background:</b> Zoonotic spillover from animal reservoirs is responsible for a significant global public health burden, but the processes that promote spillover events are poorly understood in complex urban settings. Endemic transmission of Leptospira, the agent of leptospirosis, in marginalised urban communities occurs through human exposure to an environment contaminated by bacteria shed in the urine of the rat reservoir. However, it is unclear to what extent transmission is driven by variation in the distribution of rats or by the dispersal of bacteria in rainwater runoff and overflow from open sewer systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mobilome-driven segregation of the resistome in biological wastewater treatment</a></h4>

              
                Biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTP) are considered to be hotspots of evolution and subsequent spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of fifteen AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS and sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both MGEs. Combined and timepoint-specific analyses of gene, transcript and protein abundances further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon <i>Candidatus</i> Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, for which MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way towards understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">7-Dehydrocholesterol-derived oxysterols cause neurogenic defects in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Defective 3b-hydroxysterol-D<sup>7</sup>-reductase (DHCR7) in the developmental disorder, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), results in deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Here, we show that loss of <i>DHCR7</i> causes accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterol metabolites, premature neurogenesis from murine or human cortical neural precursors, and depletion of the cortical precursor pool, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We found that a major oxysterol, 3b,5a-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), mediates these effects by initiating crosstalk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin receptor kinase TrkB. Either loss of <i>DHCR7</i> or direct exposure to DHCEO causes hyperactivation of GR and TrkB and their downstream MEK-ERK-C/EBP signaling pathway in cortical neural precursors. Moreover, direct inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis phenotype caused by the loss of <i>DHCR7</i>. These results suggest that GR could be a new therapeutic target against the neurological defects observed in SLOS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A partially nested cortical hierarchy of neural states underlies event segmentation in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental aspect of human experience is that it is segmented into discrete events. This may be underpinned by transitions between distinct neural states. Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in the cortex neural state boundaries and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions, and long states in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well-known functional networks. Perceived event boundaries overlap with neural state boundaries across large parts of the cortical hierarchy, particularly when those state boundaries demarcate a strong transition or are shared between brain regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that a partially nested cortical hierarchy of neural states forms the basis of event segmentation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sociosexual behavior requires both activating and repressive roles of Tfap2e/AP-2ε in vomeronasal sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal identity dictates the position in an epithelium, and the ability to detect, process, and transmit specific signals to specified targets. Transcription factors (TFs) determine cellular identity via direct modulation of genetic transcription and recruiting chromatin modifiers. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that define neuronal identity and their magnitude remain a critical barrier to elucidate the etiology of congenital and neurodegenerative disorders. The rodent vomeronasal organ provides a unique system to examine in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and maturation of chemosensory neurons. Here we demonstrated that the identity of postmitotic/maturing vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), and vomeronasal dependent behaviors can be reprogrammed through the rescue of <i>Tfap2e/</i>AP-2e expression in the <i>Tfap2e<sup>Null</sup></i> mice, and partially reprogrammed by inducing ectopic <i>Tfap2e</i> expression in mature apical VSNs. We suggest that the transcription factor <i>Tfap2e</i> can reprogram VSNs bypassing cellular plasticity restrictions, and that it directly controls the expression of batteries of vomeronasal genes.

                The early life environment programmes cortical architecture and cognition across the life course. A measure of cortical organisation that integrates information from multi-modal MRI and is unbound by arbitrary parcellations has proven elusive, which hampers efforts to uncover the perinatal origins of cortical health. Here, we use the Vogt-Bailey index to provide a fine-grained description of regional homogeneities and sharp variations in cortical microstructure based on feature gradients, and we investigate the impact of being born preterm on cortical development. Preterm infants have a homogeneous microstructure in temporal and occipital lobes, and the medial parietal, cingulate, and frontal cortices, compared with term infants. These observations replicated across two independent datasets and were robust to differences that remain in the data after matching samples and alignment of processing and quality control strategies. We conclude that cortical microstructural architecture is altered in preterm infants in a spatially distributed rather than localised fashion.

                It is widely recognized that sensorimotor learning is enhanced when the feedback is provided throughout the movement compared to when it is provided at the end of the movement. However, the source of this advantage is unclear: Continuous feedback is more ecological, dynamic, and available earlier than endpoint feedback. Here we assess the relative merits of these factors using a method that allows us to manipulate feedback timing independent of actual hand position. By manipulating the onset time of endpoint feedback, we found that adaptation was modulated in a non-monotonic manner, with the peak of the function occurring in advance of the hand reaching the target. Moreover, at this optimal time, learning was of similar magnitude as that observed with continuous feedback. By varying movement duration, we demonstrate that this optimal time occurs at a relatively fixed time after movement onset, an interval we hypothesize corresponds to when the comparison of the sensory prediction and feedback generates the strongest error signal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic stress exposure alters the gut barrier: sex-specific effects on microbiota and jejunum tight junctions</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, 30-50% of patients are unresponsive to commonly prescribed antidepressants, highlighting untapped causal biological mechanisms. Dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract that are modulated by gut microorganisms, has been implicated in MDD pathogenesis. Exposure to chronic stress disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, still, little is known about intestinal barrier function in these conditions particularly for the small intestine where most food and drug absorption takes place. Thus, here we investigate how chronic social or variable stress, two mouse models of depression, impact the jejunum (JEJ) intestinal barrier in males and females. Mice were subjected to stress paradigms followed by analysis of gene expression profiles of intestinal barrier-related targets, fecal microbial composition, and blood-based markers. Altered microbial populations as well as changes in gene expression of JEJ tight junctions were observed depending on the type and duration of stress, with sex-specific effects. We took advantage of machine learning to characterize in detail morphological tight junction properties identifying a cluster of ruffled junctions in stressed animals. Junctional ruffling is associated with inflammation, so we evaluated if LPS injection recapitulates stress-induced changes in the JEJ and observed profound sex differences. Finally, LPS-binding protein (LBP), a marker of gut barrier leakiness, was associated with stress vulnerability in mice and translational value was confirmed on blood samples from women with MDD. Our results provide evidence that chronic stress disrupts intestinal barrier homeostasis in conjunction with the manifestation of depressive-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner in mice and possibly, human depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of a novel gene-environment-based animal model to study resilience and susceptibility to PTSD and co-morbid depression</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and co-morbid depression are frequently associated with severe symptoms, poor response to treatment and worse prognosis. Due to the absence of a suitable animal model, little is known about the biological basis of the comorbidity, severely limiting the discovery of new and more effective treatment options. The Flinders Sensitive Line rats (FSL) is a well-validated, selectively bred animal model of depression. However, several of its features, such as cognitive deficits and altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response, also match symptomatic clusters of PTSD. In parallel, its resistant counterpart, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL), is extensively used as a simple control. Still, little is known about its performance compared to the original strain, Sprague Dawley (SD), from which the FSL/FRL was originally derived. AIMS: Characterizing the behavioural performance and mechanisms involved in FSL, FRL and SD rats in fear-memory paradigms. METHODS: FSL, SD and FRL animals were submitted to tests assessing hippocampal-dependent and fear-related memory. Subsequently, plasticity factors and endocrine responses to stress were analysed to elucidate the molecular basis for the observed behavioural alterations. RESULTS: We found that FRL animals presented intact recognition memory and innate fear responses but could not properly display conditioned responses in the Conditioned Fear Conditioning (CFC) paradigm. FSL animals, despite a poor performance in the Novel Object Recognition task (NOR), showed similar levels of conditioned responses compared to SD, but impairments in extinction learning, a feature highly related to PTSD. The behavioural alterations were accompanied by alterations in plasma corticosterone levels and hippocampal expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and FKBP51. CONCLUSION: For the first time, we demonstrate an animal model of resilience and vulnerability to PTSD and co-morbid depression. The results suggest that the endophenotypes may be based on aberrant endocrine stress responses in the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARS-CoV-2 infection of human neurons requires endosomal cell entry and can be blocked by inhibitors of host phosphoinositol-5 kinase</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 is a disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In addition to respiratory illness, COVID-19 patients exhibit neurological symptoms that can last from weeks to months (long COVID). It is unclear whether these neurological manifestations are due to infection of brain cells. We found that a small fraction of cortical neurons, but not astrocytes, were naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Based on the inhibitory effect of blocking antibodies, the infection seemed to depend on the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which was expressed at very low levels. Although only a limited number of neurons was infectable, the infection was productive, as demonstrated by the presence of double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm (the hallmark of viral replication), abundant synthesis of viral late genes localized throughout the neuronal cell, and an increase in viral RNA in the culture medium within the first 48 h of infection (viral release). The productive entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, which results in the delivery of viral genome into the cytoplasm of the target cell. The fusion is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of the viral surface protein spike, which can occur at the plasma membrane or from endo/lysosomes. Using specific combinations of small-molecule inhibitors, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human neurons was insensitive to nafamostat and camostat, which inhibit cellular serine proteases found on the cell surface, including TMPRSS2. In contrast, the infection was blocked by apilimod, an inhibitor of phosphatidyl-inositol 5 kinase (PIK5K) that regulates endosomal maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systemic and intrinsic functions of ATRX in glial cell fate and CNS myelination</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders are often characterized by abnormal production of myelin, an extension of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane wrapped around axons to facilitate nerve conduction. However, the molecular mechanisms that control myelination during brain development are incompletely resolved. Here, we provide evidence that loss of ATRX, encoded by the gene mutated in the ATR-X intellectual disability syndrome, leads to myelin deficits in the mouse CNS. While postnatal systemic thyroxine administration can improve myelination, the rescue is incomplete, pointing to additional roles of ATRX in this process. We show that targeted inactivation of ATRX in postnatal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but not in neurons, also leads to myelination deficits, demonstrating cell-intrinsic effects of ATRX deficiency. A subset of ATRX-null OPCs express lower levels of oligodendrocyte specification and differentiation markers, including the basic helix-loop-helix Olig2 transcription factor. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that ATRX occupies genomic sites in OPCs marked by H3K27Ac, CHD7 and CHD8 and demonstrate that reduced Olig2 expression is associated with decreased H3K27Ac. Finally, our data suggest that ATRX-null OPCs acquire a more plastic state and can exhibit astrocyte-like features in vitro and in vivo, supporting a model in which ATRX regulates the onset of myelination by promoting OPC identity and suppressing astrogliogenesis. These previously unrecognized functions of ATRX might explain white matter pathogenesis in ATR-X syndrome patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meteorin alleviates Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a challenging condition to treat, and arises due to severe, dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel. This often results in debilitating sensory and motor deficits that are not effectively prevented or alleviated by existing therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of Meteorin, a neurotrophic factor, in reversing neuropathic pain in rodent models of peripheral nerve injury induced by physical trauma. Here, we sought to investigate the potential antinociceptive effects of recombinant mouse Meteorin (rmMeteorin) using a paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy model in male and female mice. Paclitaxel treatment (4 x 4mg/kg, i.p.) induced hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity by day 8 after treatment. Thereafter, in a reversal dosing paradigm, five repeated injections of rmMeteorin (0.5 and 1.8mg/kg s.c. respectively) administered over 9 days produced a significant and long-lasting attenuation of mechanical hypersensitivity in both sexes. Additionally, administration of rmMeteorin (0.5 and 1.8mg/kg), initiated before and during paclitaxel treatment (prevention dosing paradigm), blocked the establishment of hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity. Repeated systemic administration of rmMeteorin in both dosing paradigms decreased histochemical signs of satellite glial cell reactivity as measured by glutamine synthetase and connexin43 protein expression in the DRG. Additionally, in the prevention administration paradigm rmMeteorin had a protective effect against paclitaxel-induced loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers. Our findings indicate that rmMeteorin has a robust and sustained antinociceptive effect in the paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy model and the development of recombinant human Meteorin could be a novel and effective therapeutic for CIPN treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BRAin-wide Neuron quantification Tool reveals strong sexual dimorphism in the evolution of fear memory</a></h4>

              
                The neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral responses triggered by fear have received wide interest now, especially with the surge of fear-related disorders associated with the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Fear responses are functionally adaptive behaviors that are strengthened as memories. Indeed, knowing fear circuitry could be the turning point for the comprehension of this emotion and its pathological states, even addressing potential treatments. Understanding memory dynamics presents fundamental technological challenges and calls for the development of new tools and methods able to analyze the entire brain with single-neuron resolution. In this context, we developed the BRAin-wide Neuron quantification Tool (BRANT) for mapping neuronal activation at micron resolution, combining tissue clearing protocol, high-resolution light-sheet microscopy, and automated 3D image analysis. This method allowed us to quantify the evolution of neuronal activation patterns across multiple phases of memory. This approach highlighted a strong sexual dimorphism in the circuits recruited during memory recall, which had no counterpart in the behaviour. The methodology presented here paves the way for a comprehensive functional characterization of the evolution of fear memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">APP family member dimeric complexes are formed predominantly in synaptic compartments</a></h4>

              
                The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is part of a larger gene family, including the APP like proteins APLP1 and APLP2. They share similar structures, form homo- and heterotypic dimers and exhibit overlapping functions. We investigated complex formation of the APP family members via two inducible dimerization systems, the FKBP-rapamycin based dimerization as well as cysteine induced dimerization, combined with coimmunoprecipitations and Blue Native (BN) gel analyses. Within the APP family, APLP1 shows the highest degree of dimerization and high molecular weight (HMW) complex formation. Interestingly, about 20% of APP is dimerized in cultured cells while about 50% of APP is dimerized in mouse brains, independent of age and splice forms. Furthermore, we could show that dimerized APP originates mostly from neurons and is enriched in synaptosomes. Finally, BN gel analysis of human cortex samples shows a significant decrease of APP dimers in AD patients compared to controls, suggesting that loss of dimers of full-length APP might correlate with loss of synapses in the process of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mushroom body output encodes behavioral decision during sensory-motor transformation</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavioral decisions are dynamically formed by evaluating momentary sensory evidence on the background of individual experience and the acute motivational state. In insects, the mushroom body (MB) has been implicated in forming associative memories and in assessing the appetitive or aversive valence of sensory stimuli to bias approach versus avoidance behavior. To study the MB involvement in innate feeding behavior we performed extracellular single-unit recordings from MB output neurons (MBONs) while simultaneously monitoring a defined feeding behavior in response to timed odor stimulation in naive cockroaches. All animals expressed the feeding behavior almost exclusively in response to food odors. Likewise, MBON responses were invariably and strongly tuned to the same odors. Importantly, MBON responses were restricted to behaviorally responded trials, which allowed the accurate prediction of the occurrence versus non-occurrence of the feeding behavior in individual trials from the neuronal population activity. During responded trials the neuronal activity generally preceded the onset of the feeding behavior, indicating a causal relation. Our results contest the predominant view that MBONs encode stimulus valence. Rather, we conclude that the MB output dynamically encodes the behavioral decision to inform downstream motor networks.

	<p>Prior research demonstrates that music making, physical exercise, and social activity have unique, positive effects on cognition and mood. One intervention, &amp;amp;ldquo;Jymmin&amp;amp;reg;&amp;amp;rdquo;, was developed incorporating these approaches and found effective for decreased pain perception and increased endurance, self-efficacy, mood, and muscle efficiency. Previously, Jymmin was not piloted with older adults with dementia. The current study is a randomized pilot study of the Jymmin&amp;amp;reg; with an older adult population in a long-term care facility (n = 38), evaluated across dementia levels (mild, moderate, or severe). Results found significant improvements in scores on a confrontation naming task across all conditions (p = 0.047) and a significant interaction effect for short-term memory scores (p = 0.046), suggesting higher scores at Time 2 for the experimental group and at Time 3 for the control group. There were no significant changes in mood ratings. Findings are discussed in the context of neural activity and musical agency.</p>

	<p>Research on patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) showed neurocognitive impairments in various domains. However, social cognition has barely been investigated. Facial emotion recognition is a vital aspect of social cognition, but whether emotion recognition is affected in LGG patients is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of LGG and resection by examining emotion recognition pre- and postoperatively. Additionally, the relationships among emotion recognition and general cognition and tumor location were investigated. Thirty patients with LGG who underwent resective surgery were included and matched with 63 healthy control participants (HCs). Emotion recognition was measured with the Facial Expressions of Emotion&amp;amp;ndash;Stimuli and Tests (FEEST) and general cognition with neuropsychological tests. Correlations and within-group and between-group comparisons were calculated. Before surgery, patients performed significantly worse than the HCs on FEEST-Total and FEEST-Anger. Paired comparisons showed no significant differences between FEEST scores before and post-surgery. No significant correlations with general cognition and tumor location were found. To conclude, the results of this study indicate that the tumor itself contributes significantly to social cognitive dysfunction and that surgery causes no additional deficit. Impairments were not related to general cognitive deficits or tumor location. Consequently, incorporating tests for emotion recognition into the neuropsychological assessment of patients with LGG is important.</p>

	<p>A comparative single-evaluation cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate cognitive damage in post-COVID-19 patients. The psychophysics tests of Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) and Simple Reaction Time (SRT), under a designed virtual environment, were used to evaluate the cognitive processes of decision-making, visual attention, and information processing speed. The population under study consisted of 147 individuals, 38 controls, and 109 post-COVID patients. During the 2AFC test, an Emotiv EPOC+&amp;amp;reg; headset was used to obtain EEG signals to evaluate their Focus, Interest, and Engagement metrics. Results indicate that compared to healthy patients or recovered patients from mild-moderate COVID-19 infection, patients who recovered from a severe-critical COVID infection showed a poor performance in different cognitive tests: decision-making tasks required higher visual sensitivity (p = 0.002), Focus (p = 0.01) and information processing speed (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These results signal that the damage caused by the coronavirus on the central nervous and visual systems significantly reduces the cognitive processes capabilities, resulting in a prevalent deficit of 42.42% in information processing speed for mild-moderate cases, 46.15% for decision-making based on visual sensitivity, and 62.16% in information processing speed for severe-critical cases. A psychological follow-up for patients recovering from COVID-19 is recommended based on our findings.</p>

	<p>Staged surgery strategy was preferred for patients with intra-extracranial communicating jugular foramen paraganglioma (IECJFP). A female patient who presented mild tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, together with preoperative related imaging, was diagnosed with a left intra-extracranial communicating jugular foramen lesion in November 2015 and accepted an initial operation for the intracranial tumor by retrosigmoid approach. The pathologic report was paraganglioma. In November 2021, a subtotal resection of the extracranial tumor was conducted for prominent lower cranial nerves (LCNs) deficit and middle ear involvement by infratemporal approach. In patients with IECJFP accompanied by LCNs deficit and middle ear involvement, an initial surgery for extracranial lesion and a second procedure for intracranial tumor were appropriate. However, the first operation for the intracranial lesion was preferred in IECJFP cases without LCNs deficit and middle ear involvement, as it could remove compression to the neurovascular structure and brain stem, clarify a pathological diagnosis, avoid a CSF leak, and prevent a severe neurological disorder from extracranial lesion excision. Subtotal resection of the extracranial tumor would be performed when lesion became larger combined with obvious LCNs disorder and tympanic cavity involvement. Consideration of specific staged surgical strategy for IECJFP in accordance with preoperative LCNs deficit and tympanic cavity involvement could prevent critical postoperative neurological deficit and improve quality of life in the long term.</p>

	<p>Giant pituitary adenomas are a subgroup of pituitary adenomas defined by a diameter greater than 4 cm, and they account for 5&amp;amp;ndash;14% of adenomas in surgical series. Because of their growth patterns and locations, often involving critical neurovascular structures, they represent a true surgical challenge, and gross total resection is difficult to achieve. There is no consensus on the optimal surgical strategy for giant pituitary adenomas, and, often, integrated multi-staged treatment strategies have been considered. Transcranial or transsphenoidal approaches, alone or combined, according to tumor and patient features are the two main routes. Each of these strategies has pros and cons. The conventional transcranial approach has for a long time been considered the first choice for the removal of giant pituitary adenomas. Currently, with endoscopic techniques, it is also possible to remove lesions that involve the intradural compartment and the adjacent neurovascular structures with the use of extended approaches. Our policy for the management of these lesions is to adopt the endoscopic endonasal approach as the first choice unless the tumor presents significant intracranial extension that results in it being outside the visibility and maneuverability of the endoscopic endonasal route. In these latter cases, we agree that the transcranial approach is more appropriate. However, accurate preoperative evaluation and refined treatment plans for each patient are mandatory to define a proper strategy in order to achieve the most effective long-term result.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a common age-associated neurodegenerative motor disorder, which is mainly caused by dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra. This study aimed to evaluate the function and the underlying molecular mechanism of itaconate in PD. PD models were established in vivo and in vitro using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), respectively. Pole and rotarod tests were applied to evaluate the motor coordination of mice. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in MPTP-induced mice and the MPP+ revulsive PD cell model were detected using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The inflammatory factors level was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in substantia nigra, striatum, and SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed. Moreover, the apoptosis of MPP+ revulsive SH-SY5Y cells was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis- and Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-associated proteins was measured using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Itaconate attenuated motor deficits of MPTP-induced PD mice. Itaconate inhibited dopamine neuronal damage, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in MPTP-caused PD mice and the MPP+ revulsive PD cell model. Additionally, itaconate notably repressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This research demonstrated that itaconate could attenuate neuroinflammation and exert dopamine neuroprotection in PD through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome.</p>

	<p>Aphemia is a rare and special type of speech disorder, and the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and recovery remain unclear. Here, we present a clinical case of poor spontaneous recovery of aphemia, with the anterior segment of the left arcuate fasciculus server damaged and the posterior segment intact, as detected by diffusion tensor imaging. Aphemia could be caused by the disruption of the cortical and subcortical language circuits. In particular, our data support the view that damage to the anterior segment of the left arcuate fasciculus may result in poor spontaneous recovery from speech production deficits and that an intact posterior segment seems to be crucial for supporting residual language comprehension ability in patients with post-stroke aphasia. Collectively, these data imply the importance of the left arcuate fasciculus during recovery from the language disorder in the subacute stage of stroke.</p>

	<p>Iatrogenic injury of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is a rare, and probably underreported, complication of transnasal endoscopic skull base surgery. Although treatment algorithms have been suggested, there is no definite consensus or guideline for the management of this severe complication. We describe a case of ICA injury that occurred during a transsphenoidal biopsy of a tumor in the cavernous sinus and we present a treatment algorithm for managing this complication. We reviewed the articles published from 1998 to 2021, reporting on major vascular injury during transnasal endoscopic skull base surgery and endonasal endoscopic surgery, and we compare the methods and results of ICA injury management reported in the literature with the presented case. The most promising treatment for ICA injury might be packing with a muscle graft initially, then performing an endovascular intervention.</p>

	<p>Background: the present study aims to assess language in preschool-aged Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) boys with normal cognitive quotients, and to establish whether language difficulties are related to attentional aspects or to the involvement of brain dystrophin isoforms. Methods: 20 children aged between 48 and 72 months were assessed with language and attention assessments for preschool children. Nine had a mutation upstream of exon 44, five between 44 and 51, four between 51 and 63, and two after exon 63. A control group comprising 20 age-matched boys with a speech language disorder and normal IQ were also used. Results: lexical and syntactic comprehension and denomination were normal in 90% of the boys with Duchenne, while the articulation and repetition of long words, and sentence repetition frequently showed abnormal results (80%). Abnormal results were also found in tests assessing selective and sustained auditory attention. Language difficulties were less frequent in patients with mutations not involving isoforms Dp140 and Dp71. The profile in Duchenne boys was different form the one observed in SLI with no cognitive impairment. Conclusion: The results of our observational cross-sectional study suggest that early language abilities are frequently abnormal in preschool Duchenne boys and should be assessed regardless of their global neurodevelopmental quotient.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Plea for a Simple But Radical Change in Scientific Publication: To Improve Openness, Reliability, and Reproducibility, Lets Deposit and Validate Our Results before Writing Articles</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Limited reproducibility and validity are major sources of concern in biology and other fields of science. Their origins have been extensively described and include material variability, incomplete materials and methods report, results selection, defective experimental design, lack of power, inappropriate statistics, overinterpretation, and reluctance to publish negative results. Promoting complete and accurate communication of positive and negative results is a major objective. Multiple steps in this direction are taken, but they are not sufficient and the general construction of articles has not been questioned. I propose here a simple change with a potentially strong positive impact. First, when they complete a substantial coherent set of experiments, scientists deposit their positive or negative results in a database ["deposited results," (DRs)], including detailed materials, methods, raw data, analysis, and processed results. The DRs are technically reviewed and validated as "validated DRs" (vDRs) or rejected until satisfactory. vDR databases are open (after an embargo period if requested by the authors) and can later be updated by them or others with replications or replication failures, providing a comprehensive active log of scientific data. Articles, in this proposal, are then built as they currently are, except they only include vDRs as strong and open building blocks. I argue that this approach would increase the transparency, reproducibility, and reliability of scientific publications and have additional advantages including accurate author credit, better material for evaluation, exhaustive scientific archiving, and increased openness of life science material.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Shaping Information Processing: The Role of Oscillatory Dynamics in a Working Memory Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neural oscillations are thought to reflect low-level operations that can be used for higher-level cognitive functions. Here, we investigated the role of brain rhythms in the 1&ndash;30 Hz range by recording MEG in human participants performing a visual delayed match-to-sample paradigm in which orientation or spatial frequency of sample and probe gratings had to be matched. A cue occurring before or after sample presentation indicated the to-be-matched feature. We demonstrate that alpha/beta power decrease tracks the presentation of the informative cue and indexes faster responses. Moreover, these faster responses coincided with an augmented phase alignment of slow oscillations, as well as phase&ndash;amplitude coupling between slow and fast oscillations. Importantly, stimulus decodability was boosted by both low alpha power and high beta power. In summary, we provide support for a comprehensive framework in which different rhythms play specific roles: slow rhythms control input sampling, while alpha (and beta) gates the information flow, beta recruits task-relevant circuits, and the timing of faster oscillations is controlled by slower ones.</p>

                Acidity caused by common gastric conditions such as non-ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, stress gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid-mediated diarrhea, biliary reflux, and constipation can be treated by administration of potent and efficacious acid suppressant (anti-secretory) agents such as antacids, histamine H2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Antacids provide symptomatic relief from hyperacidity as well as other associated conditions by neutralizing the gastric acid directly, thereby raising the gastric pH, attenuating the pepsin activity, restoring acid-base balance, and increasing prostaglandin and bicarbonate secretion. The effectiveness of antacids is determined by its acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and buffering capacity. Antacids containing a combination of aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and other ingredients such as those present in Digene showed better therapeutic efficacy even at low dosage with fewer side effects, persistent increase in gastric pH, faster and longer duration of pain relief, and fast relief from gas. Various clinical studies suggest that to obtain fast symptomatic relief, the treating physician can utilize antacids with the highest neutralizing capacities like Digene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Construction and validation of a scale of sexual self-concept for the elderly Chilean population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual self-concept has a central role in the life of the elderly population. Indeed, their sexual self-concept has significant and positive relationships with their satisfaction with life, pleasure, and willingness to interact with others. However, social-cultural prejudice means that the elderly are considered asexual individuals, harming their sexual self-concept. This prejudice is prominent in Chile, where the elderly do not have access to clear information about their sexuality. However, research on the Chilean elderly population is still in its infancy and requires more attention. Hence, this research aims to construct and validate a scale of sexual self-concept for the elderly Chilean population to cover this identified gap in the literature. Methods: Sixty items were integrated into the first version of the scale. Ten external judges were asked to assess the content validity. Twenty-eight items were maintained. Subsequently, an instrumental and cross-sectional design was implemented with a non-probabilistic sampling (N = 188). Items were refined with corrected homogeneity indices and conditional estimates of Cronbach's alpha and Omega coefficient. Results: A final scale of nine items equally distributed in three dimensions was obtained: Sexual self-efficacy (ω = 0.867), Sexual assertiveness (ω = 0.764), and Sexual self-esteem (ω = 0.803). The confirmatory factor analysis reflects that the theoretical model has an adequate fit (CFI = .989; TLI = .984; RMSEA = .086). Conclusions: The data analyses confirmed that the scale has adequate psychometric properties. This scale can be used for multidimensional measurements of sexual self-concept in the elderly in Chile. Further research can confirm its psychometric properties in different settings within the Spanish language population.

                Background: Asthma is a complicated condition characterized by chronic airway inflammation and airflow restriction, resulting in various respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. The research intended to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of two interchangeable treatment regimens administered to a group of Iraqi asthmatic children. Methods: This observational clinical study was conducted on a sample of pediatric Iraqi asthmatic patients in the central pediatric hospital in Baghdad. The study enrolled asthmatic children with moderate persistent asthma, who a specialized physician had diagnosed. Patients had been allocated to two groups to receive either medium doses of beclomethasone inhaler (80 μg twice a day) for group one, or low doses (40 μg twice a day) plus montelukast chewable tablets (5 mg once daily) for group two. This study used the Child Health Survey–child version (CHS–child version) to investigate the quality of life of included patients. Also, this study investigated the inflammatory blood markers; (eosinophils and prostaglandin D2).   Results: This research included 63 patients ranging in age from 7 to 11 years, with a slight male preponderance: group one patients (n=30) and group two patients (n=33). Compared with baseline levels, the study groups had considerably higher quality of life scores at the first follow-up visit (P<0.05). After that, the two groups' scores were non-significantly higher at the second follow-up visit compared with the first follow-up visit (P>0.05). Both groups significantly improved inflammatory biomarkers at the first follow-up visit (P <0.05). The second follow-up visit revealed further improvement in both groups. Conclusion: This research found that both groups generated substantial improvements in study parameters compared with baseline values and that the second group, which included a beclomethasone inhaler with montelukast, was associated with the highest degree of improvement in terms of quality-of-life ratings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of spinal fusion of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in Salah (Islamic Prayer) movement: a case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Corrective spine surgery is widely accepted for treating severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Postoperative spinal range of motion (ROM) could be affected after such surgery. In certain populations, such as Muslims, this ROM change can impact daily life, as it may affect the five-times-a-day prayer (Salah). This study aims to assess the influence of spinal fusion (SF) in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) during the daily Islamic prayer (Salah). Methods: SF-AIS patients were videoed while performing Salah prayer. The kinematic documentation was assessed and compared to Salah movements of a control group of age-matched Muslim AIS patients, who had not had surgery. The prayer quality changes were subjectively classified into improved, no change/remained, and worsened, according to the Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Functional outcome and pain were assessed by the Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire Version 30 (SRS-30). Results: Thirty-nine women and five men (mean age±SD: 14.8±2.3 years) met the inclusion criteria, and unoperated AIS patients were used as control (twenty-two women, mean age±SD: 15.32±1.43 years). The prostrations ROM of the SF-AIS group differed significantly from the control group (p<0.05). The GPE of the prayer movement showed improvement in 36.4%, no change in 59.1%, and worsening in 4.5% of the SF-AIS patients. The worsened group had a significantly lower bowing ROM and higher prostrations ROM compared to all groups of prayer quality changes (p<0.05). SRS-30 scores showed good outcomes (function 4.0±0.2, pain 4.2±0.5), along with the overall bowing ROM and prostrations ROM (84.2±12.0o and 53.4±9.6o, respectively). Moreover, a significant moderate positive correlation between the bowing ROM and pain (r=0.417, p=0.007) was also found. Conclusion: Spinal fusion positively affects AIS Islamic patients in maintaining their daily Salah movement, ROM and prayer quality. Prayer quality assessment should be given extra attention as an adjuvant of the SRS-30 questionnaire to evaluate Muslim patients.

                Background: Oral hygiene maintenance is a crucial and integral feature in determining the overall wellbeing of a person. It has been established that interventions for health promotion at the public health level derived from theoretical models based on social and behavioural sciences have a superior effectiveness as compared to the ones without a theoretical background. Hence a novel behavioral model known as the multi-theory model (MTM) was used to understand two important aspects of health behavior change: (i) Initiation and (ii) Sustenance in twice daily teeth brushing in a university setting with objectives to identify factors effecting MTM in initiation and sustenance of twice daily brushing behavior among students pursuing health sciences and correlating the MTM theory with socio-demographic and behavioral patterns. Methods: The study is an analytical cross-sectional study. Students pursuing Medicine and Dentistry in a University setting were included. A validated questionnaire was designed for this study. Questions were framed to evaluate the constructs of initiation and sustenance of MTM, personality, sleeping habits and demographic corelates of participants. Multiple means between the groups were compared using analysis of variance and a post hoc test. Correlation was established between different domains, the items were then entered for hierarchical multiple regression. Results: Of the 235 participants in the study, 229 completed the questionnaire. There was a significant association between brushing quartiles, professional streams (p<0.001) and academic performance (p<0.001). The hierarchical multiple regression revealed that at stage one, behavioral confidence contributed significantly to the regression model (F (1,227) = 33.227, p<0.001) and accounted for 12.4% of the variation in twice daily brushing. Conclusion: MTM is a good tool in predicting the initiation and sustenance of twice daily brushing behavior among young adults and can form a useful tool in assessing the patterns of brushing behavior in a population.

<p>The sense of body ownership can be altered after brain damage in patients affected by pathological embodiment (PE) who misidentify other peoples' limb as their own (a). We demonstrated that, in PE patients, the ability to visually discriminate self and other hands is lost at both implicit (b) and explicit (c) level.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to discriminate between one's own and others' body parts can be lost after brain damage, as in patients who misidentify someone else's hand as their own (pathological embodiment). Surprisingly, these patients do not use visual information to discriminate between the own and the alien hand. We asked whether this impaired visual discrimination emerges only in the ecological evaluation when the pathological embodiment is triggered by the physical alien hand (the examiner's one) or whether it emerges also when hand images are displayed on a screen. Forty right brain-damaged patients, with (E+ = 20) and without (E− = 20) pathological embodiment, and 24 healthy controls underwent two tasks in which stimuli depicting self and other hands was adopted. In the Implicit task, where participants judged which of two images matched a central target, the self-advantage (better performance with Self than Other stimuli) selectively emerges in controls, but not in patients. Moreover, E+ patients show a significantly lower performance with respect to both controls and E− patients, whereas E− patients were comparable to controls. In the Explicit task, where participants judged which stimuli belonged to themselves, both E− and E+ patients performed worst when compared to controls, but only E+ patients hyper-attributed others' hand to themselves (i.e., false alarms) as observed during the ecological evaluation. The VLSM revealed that SLF damage was significantly associated with the tendency of committing false alarm errors. We demonstrate that, in E+ patients, the ability to visually recognize the own body is lost, at both implicit and explicit level.</p>

<p>Neuronal connectomes play a critical role in information storage during learning and memory. We report that dopamine neurons are essential for adaptive olfactory learning in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Dopamine neurodegeneration results in significant learning impairment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Encoding and consolidating information through learning and memory is vital in adaptation and survival. Dopamine (DA) is a critical neurotransmitter that modulates behavior. However, the role of DA in learning and memory processes is not well defined. Herein, we used the olfactory adaptive learning paradigm in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to elucidate the role of DA in the memory pathway. <i>Cat-2</i> mutant worms with low DA synthesis showed a significant reduction in chemotaxis index (CI) compared to the wild type (WT) after short-term conditioning. In dat-1::ICE worms, having degeneration of DA neurons, there was a significant reduction in adaptive learning and memory. When the worms were trained in the presence of exogenous DA (10 mM) instead of food, a substantial increase in CI value was observed. Furthermore, our results suggest that both dop-1 and dop-3 DA receptors are involved in memory retention. The release of DA during conditioning is essential to initiate the learning pathway. We also noted an enhanced cholinergic receptor activity in the absence of dopaminergic neurons. The strains expressing GCaMP6 in DA neurons (pdat-1::GCaMP-6::<i>mCherry)</i> showed a rise in intracellular calcium influx in the presence of the conditional stimulus after training, suggesting DA neurons are activated during memory recall. These results reveal the critical role of DA in adaptive learning and memory, indicating that DA neurons play a crucial role in the effective processing of cognitive function.</p>

<p>Our work revealed that a combination treatment including ChABC, epidural cortical stimulation, and daily rehabilitation promotes increased muscle activity during grip strength while maximum voluntary contraction muscle recordings were acquired in awake behaving animals after a clinically relevant cervical contusion injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cervical level spinal cord injury (SCI) can severely impact upper limb muscle function, which is typically assessed in the clinic using electromyography (EMG). Here, we established novel preclinical methodology for EMG assessments of muscle function after SCI in awake freely moving animals. Adult female rats were implanted with EMG recording electrodes in bicep muscles and received bilateral cervical (C7) contusion injuries. Forelimb muscle activity was assessed by recording maximum voluntary contractions during a grip strength task and cortical motor evoked potentials in the biceps. We demonstrate that longitudinal recordings of muscle activity in the same animal are feasible over a chronic post-injury time course and provide a sensitive method for revealing post-injury changes in muscle activity. This methodology was utilized to investigate recovery of muscle function after a novel combination therapy. Cervical contused animals received intraspinal injections of a neuroplasticity-promoting agent (lentiviral-chondroitinase ABC) plus 11 weeks of cortical epidural electrical stimulation (3 h daily, 5 days/week) and behavioral rehabilitation (15 min daily, 5 days/week). Longitudinal monitoring of voluntary and evoked muscle activity revealed significantly increased muscle activity and upper limb dexterity with the combination treatment, compared to a single treatment or no treatment. Retrograde mapping of motor neurons innervating the biceps showed a predominant distribution across spinal segments C5–C8, indicating that treatment effects were likely due to neuroplastic changes in a mixture of intact and injured motor neurons. Thus, longitudinal assessments of muscle function after SCI correlate with skilled reach and grasp performance and reveal functional benefits of a novel combination therapy.</p>

     alt="Innovative treatments for epilepsy: Venom peptides, cannabinoids, and neurostimulation"/>
<p>This article reviews the most innovative treatments for epilepsy, given the great percentage of drug resistant patients. The topics addressed include neuromodulation, peptides derived from animal venoms, cannabinoids and nanoparticles.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antiepileptic drugs have been successfully treating epilepsy and providing individuals sustained seizure freedom. However, about 30% of the patients with epilepsy present drug resistance, which means they are not responsive to the pharmacological treatment. Considering this, it becomes extremely relevant to pursue alternative therapeutic approaches, in order to provide appropriate treatment for those patients and also improve their quality of life. In the light of that, this review aims to discuss some innovative options for the treatment of epilepsy, which are currently under investigation, addressing strategies that go from therapeutic compounds to clinical procedures. For instance, peptides derived from animal venoms, such as wasps, spiders, and scorpions, demonstrate to be promising antiepileptic molecules, acting on a variety of targets. Other options are cannabinoids and compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system, since it is now known that this network is involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Furthermore, neurostimulation is another strategy, being an alternative clinical procedure for drug-resistant patients who are not eligible for palliative surgeries.</p>

<p>Comparisons of excitation latencies between the STN and SNr suggested that the shorter latency excitation of the STN and the longer latency excitation in the second type excitation of the SNr were more likely to involve in the PPTg–STN–SNr circuit.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) are reciprocally connected brain regions that play significant roles in the motor control. However, the electrophysiological relationship among the STN, SNr, and PPTg remains controversial. The present study was designed to further explore the mutual electrophysiological relationship of these brain regions from the perspective of the PPTg–STN–SNr neural circuit. The neuronal activities in the STN and SNr were simultaneously recorded while the PPTg was stimulated in anesthetized rats. The activation of PPTg induced excitatory responses of both the STN and SNr neurons. Comparisons of excitation latencies between the STN and SNr were made to distinguish the excitation evoked from the PPTg–STN–SNr pathway. Additionally, two types of excitatory responses and various inhibitory responses with different latencies in the SNr were recorded. The SNr responses could also be classified into five different response categories, which might attribute to projections within different neural circuits. Neuronal recordings were analyzed in different electrophysiological features (i.e., interspike interval [ISI] mode, ISI asymmetry index, ISI coefficient of variance, firing rate, burst index, and trough peak duration), and different response patterns of neurons had their specific features in neuronal activities. These findings indicated the complex interactions among the STN, SNr, and PPTg electrophysiologically, and provided insights into exploring information transmission mechanisms underlying these circuits.</p>

     alt="Alcohol use disorder-associated structural and functional characteristics of the insula"/>
<p>This study investigated differences in the anterior and posterior insula observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder. Structural differences were mostly seen in the anterior regions, while functional connectivity differences were observed in posterior insular regions as well. Differing connectivity was observed with frontal, parietal, cingulate, occipital, cerebellar, and temporal brain regions.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Based on our current understanding of insular regions, effects of chronic alcohol use on the insula may affect the integration of sensory-motor, socio-emotional, and cognitive function. There is no comprehensive understanding about these differences in individuals with alcohol use disorder that accounts for both structural and functional differences related to chronic alcohol use. The purpose of this study was to investigate these variations in both the anterior and posterior insula in persons with alcohol use disorder. We investigated insula gray matter volume, morphometry, white matter structural connectivity, and resting state functional connectivity in 75 participants with alcohol use disorder (females = 27) and 75 age-matched healthy control participants (females = 39). Results indicated structural differences mostly in the anterior regions, while functional connectivity differences were observed in both the anterior and posterior insula in those with alcohol use disorder. Differing connectivity was observed with frontal, parietal, occipital, cingulate, cerebellar, and temporal brain regions. While these results align with prior studies showing differences primarily in anterior insular regions, they also contribute to the existing literature suggesting differences in anterior insular connectivity with brain regions shown to be engaged during higher cognitive and emotional tasks.</p>

<p>New open-source software allowed measurement of trunk curvature during dark-evoked larval zebrafish movements following spinal cord transection.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by permanent loss of damaged axons, resulting in chronic disability. In contrast, zebrafish can regenerate axonal projections following central nervous system injury and re-establish synaptic contacts with distant targets; elucidation of the underlying molecular events is an important goal with translational potential for improving outcomes in SCI patients. We generated transgenic zebrafish with GFP-labeled axons and transected their spinal cords at 10 days post-fertilization. Intravital confocal microscopy revealed robust axonal regeneration following the procedure, with abundant axons bridging the transection site by 48 h post-injury. In order to analyze neurological function in this model, we developed and validated new open-source software to measure zebrafish lateral trunk curvature during propulsive and turning movements at high temporal resolution. Immediately following spinal cord transection, axial movements were dramatically decreased caudal to the lesion site, but preserved rostral to the injury, suggesting the induction of motor paralysis below the transection level. Over the subsequent 96 h, the magnitude of movements caudal to the lesion recovered to baseline, but the rate of change of truncal curvature did not fully recover, suggesting incomplete restoration of caudal strength over this time course. Quantification of both morphological and functional recovery following SCI will be important for the analysis of axonal regeneration and downstream events necessary for restoration of motor function. An extensive array of genetic and pharmacological interventions can be deployed in the larval zebrafish model to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

Female mice exhibit greater biological disruption including weight loss, inflammation, hepatic and coronary dysfunction and anxiogenesis; males exhibit reduced cardiac stress-resistance and protective gene expression, and anhedonia (with increased monoamine vs. decreased adipokine levels).</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Psychosocial stress promotes and links mood and cardiovascular disorders in a sex-specific manner. However, findings in animal models are equivocal, in some cases opposing human dimorphisms. We examined central nervous system (CNS), behavioral, endocrine, cardiac, and hepatic outcomes in male or female C57Bl/6 mice subjected to chronic social stress (56 days of social isolation, with intermittent social confrontation encounters twice daily throughout the final 20 days). Females exhibited distinct physiological and behavioral changes, including relative weight loss, and increases in coronary resistance, hepatic inflammation, and thigmotaxic behavior in the open field. Males evidence reductions in coronary resistance and cardiac ischemic tolerance, with increased circulating and hippocampal monoamine levels and emerging anhedonia. Shared CNS gene responses include reduced hippocampal <i>Maoa</i> and increased <i>Htr1b</i> expression, while unique responses include repression of hypothalamic <i>Ntrk1</i> and upregulation of cortical <i>Nrf2</i> and <i>Htr1b</i> in females; and repression of hippocampal <i>Drd1</i> and hypothalamic <i>Gabra1</i> and <i>Oprm</i> in males. Declining cardiac stress resistance in males was associated with repression of cardiac leptin levels and metabolic, mitochondrial biogenesis, and anti-inflammatory gene expression. These integrated data reveal distinct biological responses to social stress in males and females, and collectively evidence greater biological disruption or allostatic load in females (consistent with propensities to stress-related mood and cardiovascular disorders in humans). Distinct stress biology, and molecular to organ responses, emphasize the importance of sex-specific mechanisms and potential approaches to stress-dependent disease.</p>
