                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of dopamine deficiency and isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) on cognitive performance in early neuronal α-synuclein disease (NSD) with hyposmia but without motor disability.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative baseline data, cognitive performance was assessed with a cognitive summary score (CSS) derived from robust healthy control (HC) norms. Performance was examined for participants with hyposmia in early NSD-Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS), either stage 2A (cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein seed amplification assay [SAA]+, dopamine transporter scan [DaTscan]−) or 2B (SAA+, DaTscan+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants were stage 2A (n = 101), stage 2B (N = 227), and HCs (n = 158). Although stage 2 had intact Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (mean [SD] = 27.0 [2.3]), stage 2A had a numerically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.05, <i>p =</i> NS; effect size = 0.09) and stage 2B a statistically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; effect size = 0.40) compared with HCs. In stage 2A, hyposmia alone was associated with normal cognition, but those with comorbid iRBD had significantly worse cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, effect size =0.50). In stage 2B, hyposmia alone had abnormal cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0078, effect size = 0.29), and superimposed iRBD had a statistically significant additive effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using a novel CSS, we demonstrated that hyposmia is associated with cognitive deficits in prodromal NSD without motor disability, particularly when comorbid dopamine system impairment or comorbid iRBD is present. Therefore, it is critical to include and assess cognition at all stages when studying synuclein disease, even in the absence of motor disability. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07693">Astrocyte-Mediated Higher-Order Control of Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of higher-order topological signals are increasingly recognized as a key aspect of the activity of complex systems. A paradigmatic example are synaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different mechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms, the role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the so-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the competition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have yet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the tripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in short-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and pre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability of neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term plasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a minimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation that propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit is highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to external input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different synapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation robustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that supports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism by which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information processing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest recurrent circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07858">OMiSO: Adaptive optimization of state-dependent brain stimulation to shape neural population states</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordinated activity of neural populations underlies myriad brain functions. Manipulating this activity using brain stimulation techniques has great potential for scientific and clinical applications, as it provides a tool to causally influence brain function. The state of the brain affects how neural populations respond to incoming sensory stimuli. Thus, taking into account pre-stimulation neural population activity may be crucial to achieve a desired causal manipulation using stimulation. In this work, we propose Online MicroStimulation Optimization (OMiSO), a brain stimulation framework that leverages brain state information to find stimulation parameters that can drive neural population activity toward specified states. OMiSO includes two key advances: i) it leverages the pre-stimulation brain state to choose optimal stimulation parameters, and ii) it adaptively refines the choice of those parameters by considering newly-observed stimulation responses. We tested OMiSO by applying intracortical electrical microstimulation in a monkey and found that it outperformed competing methods that do not incorporate these advances. Taken together, OMiSO provides greater accuracy in achieving specified activity states, thereby advancing neuromodulation technologies for understanding the brain and for treating brain disorders.

                arXiv:2507.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic nanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule detection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative plasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free, label-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great sensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we employ ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a central role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative evaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate the superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The results reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to silicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification accuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap between nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of AlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves the way for probe-free, label-free biomolecule profiling, offering transformative implications for biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07907">A statistical physics framework for optimal learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.07907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.

                arXiv:2507.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14046">Clarifying the conceptual dimensions of representation in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.14046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the centrality of the notion of representation to its explanations, neuroscience lacks a unified framework for the concepts used to characterize representation, leading to disparate use of terminology and measures associated with representation. To offer clarification, we propose a core set of conceptual dimensions that characterize representations in neuroscience. These dimensions describe relations between a neural response, features that may be represented, and downstream effects of the neural response. A neural response may be shown to be sensitive and specific to a feature, invariant to other features, and functional, which means that it is used downstream in the brain. We use information-theoretic measures to introduce these conceptual dimensions unambiguously and explain how data analysis methods such as correlational analyses, decoding and encoding models, representational similarity analysis, and tests of statistical dependence or adaptation relate to our framework. We consider several canonical examples, including the representation of orientation, numerosity, and spatial location, which illustrate how the evidence put forth in support or criticism of representational conclusions is systematized by our framework. By offering a unified conceptual framework we hope to aid the comparison and integration of results across studies and research groups and to help determine when evidence for a representational conclusion is strong.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493">Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the volume of training data can enable the auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation models on ASD recognition, and many existing models lack inherent interpretability, as they do not explicitly incorporate prior neurobiological knowledge such as the hierarchical structure of functional brain networks. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract latent representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy (HMMD), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to mitigate discrepancies in conditional distributions across domains. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior classification performance for ASD compared to baseline models, with improved robustness to multi-site heterogeneity. Specifically, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.03%. Moreover, its generalization capability is further validated through experiments conducted on extra Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/LYQbyte/H2MSDA.

Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

                arXiv:2507.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1 spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources. The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking neural networks on toy problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874">Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.

                arXiv:2507.07207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts.

                arXiv:2507.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

                arXiv:2507.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Abstract: Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.

                arXiv:2503.20286v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

                arXiv:2507.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: Our work integrates an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize ansatz parameters in place of traditional gradient-based methods. We benchmark this Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) approach on the Max-Cut problem for $d$-3 regular graphs of 4 to 26 nodes, demonstrating equal or higher accuracy and reduced variance compared to COBYLA-based QAOA, especially when using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness evaluations. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed multi-population EA strategy, executing parallel, independent populations on two quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical communication of 'elite' solutions. Experiments on quantum simulators and IBM hardware validate the approach. We also discuss potential extensions of our method and outline promising future directions in scalable, distributed quantum optimization on hybrid quantum-classical infrastructures.

                <p>In the mammalian visual system, three functionally distinct parallel processing streams extend from the retina to the visual thalamus and then to the visual cortex: magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P), and koniocellular (K). Tree shrews (<I>Tupaia belangeri</I>), a preprimate species, provide an advantageous model to study the K pathway in isolation because, while M and P pathways remain mixed in Lamina 1 (L1), L2, L4, and L5 of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), L3 and L6 receive strictly K-input from the contralateral eye. Additionally, K-input laminae selectively receive glutamatergic axons from the superior colliculus. To reveal how cellular and synaptic properties of K geniculate laminae may differ from M/P laminae and how tectal input may shape the K relay to the cortex, we studied the morphology and connectivity of retinal and tectal terminals in pathway-specific laminae. While confirming that K laminae relay cells contain calbindin, we also found its expression in GABAergic cells across all laminae. No cell-type or lamina specificity was observed for parvalbumin. Ultrastructurally, retinal terminals are morphologically distinct in M/P versus K laminae. Tectogeniculate axons in L3 and L6 resemble retinal terminals in their morphology and synaptic targets, while corticogeniculate terminals are sparse in L6. VGluT2, the molecular marker for large-sized driver terminals, is expressed prominently in one of the three tectal cell types that project to LGN. Morphological differences in synaptic circuitry between L3 and L6 provide further evidence that two geniculate K laminae are differentially innervated to relay distinct sets of information to the cortex.</p>

                <p>by Mohammad Kayyali, Ana Mincholé, Shuang Qian, Alistair Young, Devran Ugurlu, Elliot Fairweather, Steven Niederer, John Whitaker, Martin Bishop, Pablo Lamata</p>

Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings are affected by the heart’s three-dimensional orientation within the thorax, i.e., the anatomical axis. Various cardiac conditions can cause the anatomical axis to shift and/or alter the pattern of electrical activation, leading to changes in the electrical axis. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of a formal, population-level study of the interplay between the cardiac anatomical and electrical axes and the factors that affect them. In this context, this study aimed to: (1) propose standardised definitions for the cardiac anatomical and electrical axes, (2) characterise their population-wide interplay in healthy conditions, (3) evaluate the impact of hypertension on their distribution and (4) identify associations with phenotypical and disease characteristics. Using cardiac magnetic resonance images and 12-lead ECGs from ~39,000 UK Biobank participants, patient-specific, paired biventricular geometries and vectorcardiograms were constructed. Five anatomical and four electrical axis definitions were computed, with the optimal pair of definitions selected based on their mutual alignment in 3D space within 28,000 healthy subjects. Accordingly, the anatomical axis was defined as the vector from the apex to the spatial centre of the four valves, and the electrical axis as the direction of the maximum QRS dipole. Mean angular separation in 3D, ΔAE3D, was 145.0° ± 16.8° in the healthy cohort. The electrical axes exhibited a much larger variability, and strong evidence of anatomical-electrical coupling was identified. Increasing BMI notably affected the anatomical axis, rotating the heart more horizontally—a pattern mirrored by the electrical axis. Both axes were also significantly influenced by sex and, to a lesser extent, age. The axes were then studied in the sub-cohort of ~3,500 UK BioBank participants with primary hypertension, where a similar rotational pattern as that with increasing BMI was revealed. Finally, phenome-wide association studies in the 39,000 participants reveal associations between the axes angular metrics and phenotypes signalling an increased afterload, and an association to hypertension among other clinical conditions. These findings underscore the complex anatomical-electrical interplay and highlight the potential of cardiac axes biomarkers for an improved clinical ECG interpretation and disease characterisation.

                <p>by Laura Downie, Nuria Ferrandiz, Elizabeth Courthold, Megan Jones, Stephen J. Royle</p>

Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are areas of close proximity between organelles that allow the exchange of material, among other roles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are, therefore, best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here, we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed <i>LaBeRling</i>, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets, and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic human cells. LaBeRling is nondisruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.

                <p>by Matthew D. Hurton, Jennifer M. Miller, Miler T. Lee</p>

After egg fertilization, an initially silent embryonic genome is transcriptionally activated during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In zebrafish, maternal vertebrate pluripotency factors Nanog, Pou5f3 (OCT4 homolog), and Sox19b (SOX2 homolog) (NPS) play essential roles in orchestrating embryonic genome activation, acting as “pioneers” that open condensed chromatin and mediate acquisition of activating histone modifications. However, some embryonic gene transcription still occurs in the absence of these factors, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms regulating genome activation. To identify chromatin signatures of these unknown pathways, we profiled the histone modification landscape of zebrafish embryos using CUT&RUN. Our regulatory map revealed two subclasses of enhancers distinguished by presence or absence of H3K4me2. Enhancers lacking H3K4me2 tend to require NPS factors for de novo activation, while enhancers bearing H3K4me2 are epigenetically bookmarked by DNA hypomethylation to recapitulate gamete activity in the embryo, independent of NPS pioneering. Thus, parallel enhancer activation pathways combine to induce transcriptional reprogramming to pluripotency in the early embryo.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003217">Wakefulness can be distinguished from general anesthesia and sleep in flies using a massive library of univariate time series analyses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Angus Leung, Ahmed Mahmoud, Travis Jeans, Ben D. Fulcher, Bruno van Swinderen, Naotsugu Tsuchiya</p>

The neural mechanisms of consciousness remain elusive. Previous studies on both human and non-human animals, through manipulation of level of conscious arousal, have reported that specific time-series features correlate with level of consciousness, such as spectral power in certain frequency bands. However, such features often lack principled, theoretical justifications as to why they should be related with level of consciousness. This raises two significant issues: firstly, many other types of times-series features which could also reflect conscious level have been ignored due to researcher biases toward specific analyses; and secondly, it is unclear how to interpret identified features to understand the neural activity underlying consciousness, especially when they are identified from recordings which summate activity across large areas such as electroencephalographic recordings. To address the first concern, here we propose a new approach: in the absence of any theoretical priors, we should be maximally agnostic and treat as many known features as feasible as equally promising candidates. To apply this approach, we use <i>h</i>ighly <i>c</i>omparative <i>t</i>ime-<i>s</i>eries <i>a</i>nalysis (<i>hctsa</i>), a toolbox which provides over 7,700 different univariate time-series features originating from different research fields. To address the second issue, we employ <i>hctsa</i> to high-quality neural recordings from a relatively simple brain, the fly brain (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), extracting features from local field potentials during wakefulness, general anesthesia, and sleep. At Stage 1 of this registered report, we constructed a classifier for each feature, for discriminating wakefulness and anesthesia in a discovery group of flies (<i>N</i> = 13). At Stage 2, we assessed their performances on four independent groups of evaluation flies, from which recordings were made during anesthesia and sleep, and which were originally blinded to the data analysis team (<i>N</i> = 49). We found only 47 time-series features, applied to recordings obtained from the center of the fly brain, to also significantly classify wake from anesthesia or sleep in all 4 of these evaluation datasets. Most of these were related to autocorrelation, and they indicated that signals during wakefulness remained correlated to their past for a longer timescale than during anesthesia and sleep. Meanwhile, time-series features related to well-known potential markers of consciousness, such as those related to complexity or spectral power, failed to generalize across all the flies. However, many of these complexity and spectral features have a consistent direction of effect due to anesthesia or sleep across flies, suggesting that even slight variations in experiment setup can reduce generalizability of classifiers. These results caution the current state of frequent discoveries of new potential consciousness markers, which may not generalize across datasets, and point to autocorrelation as a class of dynamical properties which does.

                Background In the Indian coastal state of Odisha, agriculture remains the primary livelihood, particularly paddy cultivation. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use, particularly water. Given the state’s varied climatic zones and soil types, there is a pressing need for sustainable solutions. Precision agriculture, which utilizes advanced information technologies for decision-making, offers a pathway to enhance productivity while minimizing resource wastage. Methods This study applied machine learning (ML) and ensemble regression techniques to predict water usage for paddy cultivation in Odisha. The models were trained on a comprehensive dataset integrating remote sensing data, satellite imagery, historical weather records, soil profiles, and field-level observations. Various regression algorithms were used in ensemble combinations to enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness. Soil moisture, climatic conditions, and crop health indicators were continuously monitored using sensor-based and image-derived data. Results The ensemble regression models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with performance metrics exceeding 90% in forecasting optimal water usage. These predictions enabled precise water management tailored to specific agro-climatic zones within Odisha. Furthermore, the models effectively supported crop recommendation strategies based on soil and environmental parameters, ensuring optimal resource allocation. Conclusions The integration of ML and ensemble regression in precision agriculture significantly improves water use efficiency and supports data-driven farming in coastal Odisha. By enabling accurate predictions of water needs and crop suitability, these technologies contribute to maximizing yield, conserving natural resources, and fostering long-term sustainability. The findings emphasize the potential for scalable, technology-driven solutions to modernize traditional agricultural practices in resource-constrained environments.

                In this datanote we presented the data of 31 iRBD (idiopathic Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder) patients studied throughout three years to assess their eventual phenoconversion to Parkinson’s disease and other established neurodegenerative conditions. iRBD is a prodromal condition involved in the development of neurological pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. In a previous study we evaluated transcription factor mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells as predictive biomarkers of phenoconversion in iRBD. We demonstrated that among the transcription factors mRNA levels analysed, STAT1, GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells may be used to predict phenoconversion.

                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open fire system which consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased at the neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients using appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, a modified stove, and a combination of a modified stove and double pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring the refractive index and specific gravity. Sensory evaluation of areke samples was evaluated by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The greatest ethanol concentration of the areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All of the judges agreed that traditional and double pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double pipe distillation with modified stove had a better performance compared to the traditional Areke distillation.

                Teixeira et al. present UltraID-light-inducible protein aggregation (UltraID-LIPA), a technique that combines optogenetic induction of α-synuclein aggregation with proximity-based proteomics. This system enables high-resolution capture of early aggregation events in live cells and implicates known and novel endolysosomal proteins, offering a robust framework for dissecting early pathogenic mechanisms in synucleinopathies and guiding future innovations.

                SCN2A loss-of-function mutations are a high-risk factor for autism. Li et al. show that selective Scn2a deficiency in VTA dopaminergic neurons or global haploinsufficiency in Scn2a+/− mice causes dopamine system hypofunction. Levodopa treatment at an appropriate dosage can alleviate non-motor autistic-like behaviors, including insufficient anxiety and social deficits.

                Da Graça et al. identify ER-endosome contact sites as critical hubs for autophagosome biogenesis, where starvation triggers sequential endosome tethering to ER exit sites. This spatiotemporal coordination regulates Ca2+ signaling and phase separation, leading to the formation of nano-vesicles that seed phagophore initiation.

                Neuroinflammation is central to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Stephenson et al. establish that neutral lipid accumulation is necessary for microglial activation and that microglia expressing an Alzheimer’s risk gene hijack triglyceride biosynthesis to acquire a basal immune activated state. Targeting triglyceride metabolism can modulate immune reactivity and disease phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103783">NR2F2 is required in the embryonic testis for fetal Leydig cell development</a></h4>

              
                Male genital development in XY mammalian fetuses is triggered by the action of hormones, including testosterone, secreted by the developing testes. Defects in this process are a cause for differences in sex development (DSD), one of the most common congenital abnormalities in humans. Fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) play a central role in the synthesis of masculinizing hormones in the developing testes. Yet, the genetic cascade controlling their differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F2 (COUP-TFII) in FLC development. We report that NR2F2 is expressed in interstitial progenitor cells of the mouse embryonic testes and is downregulated upon their differentiation into FLC. By using two mouse models for conditional mutation of <i>Nr2f2</i> in the developing testes, we demonstrate that NR2F2 is required for testis morphogenesis and FLC development. NR2F2 acts in interstitial progenitors to regulate the initiation and progression of FLC differentiation. These results establish NR2F2 as an essential regulator of FLC development and steroid hormone synthesis in the mouse fetal testis and provide an entry point in understanding the etiology of 46,XY DSD associated with pathogenic NR2F2 variants.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91236">The magnitude and time course of pre-saccadic foveal prediction depend on the conspicuity of the saccade target</a></h4>

              
                We previously demonstrated that during the preparation of a saccadic eye movement, human observers anticipate defining features of the eye movement target in pre-saccadic foveal vision (Kroell and Rolfs, 2022). In this Research Advance, we show that the conspicuity of feature information at the saccade target location influences the magnitude and time course of foveal enhancement. Observers prepared a saccade to a peripheral orientation signal (the target) while monitoring the appearance of another orientation signal (the probe) in their pre-saccadic center of gaze. The foveal probe appeared in 50% of trials and either had the same orientation as the target (congruent) or a different orientation (incongruent). Crucially, we manipulated the opacity of the target against the 1/f noise background in four logarithmic steps (25–90%). An increase in opacity translated to an increase in luminance contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of orientation information within the target region. Foveal enhancement defined as the difference between hit rates to target-congruent and target-incongruent foveal probes increased with target opacity. Moreover, the time course of foveal enhancement showed an oscillatory pattern that was particularly pronounced at high target opacities. Reverse correlations furthermore suggest that at higher target opacities, false alarms were increasingly triggered by signal, i.e., by incidental orientation information in the foveal noise. Beyond providing new mechanistic insights, these findings are relevant for researchers planning to adapt our paradigm to study related questions. Presenting the saccade target at a high signal-to-noise ratio appears beneficial, as foveal congruency effects, especially when time-resolved, are most robustly detectable.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102743">Bacteriophage infection drives loss of β-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</a></h4>

              
                Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here, we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) to β-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different β-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in <i>S. aureus</i> virulence are downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

">Cortical and white matter T1w/T2w development proceed in concert during early infancy</a></h4>

              
                The infant brain undergoes rapid myelin growth that is critical for healthy brain function. This development has been characterized for gray and white matter independently, but the link between gray and white matter myelination remains unexplored. To close this knowledge gap, we processed large-scale (N=279) Developing Human Connectome Project data with automated software to identify 26 white matter bundles and map their cortical terminations, before evaluating T1w/T2w development in individuals. We found that mean T1w/T2w as well as the slope of T1w/T2w development are correlated across tissues. This synchrony of brain T1w/T2w is impacted by birth age and postnatal experience, whereas inter-individual differences in this synchrony predict motor outcomes at 17 - 25 months of age. As T1w/T2w is associated with myelin content, our results reveal an intricate relationship between gray and white matter myelination, highlighting the importance of conjointly evaluating both tissues.

">Astrocytic mGluR5 signaling tunes emotional and cognitive processing in the adult brain</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a brain region involved in both emotion regulation and higher cognitive functions. Astrocytes have emerged as active modulators of synaptic activity, capable of sensing, integrating, and responding to neuronal signals. At glutamatergic synapses, astrocytes detect glutamate through the activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). However, most existing research has focused on the role of mGluR5 in developing rodents or in pathological contexts, likely because of the reported lower astrocytic mGluR5 expression levels in adulthood compared to postnatal stages. Importantly, prior studies and our preliminary data have demonstrated mGluR5-mediated signaling in astrocytes of adult mice, supporting a role for this receptor. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether these lower levels of mGluR5 are sufficient to activate astrocytes in the adult brain and (2) to investigate whether this activation is involved in regulating circuit function and behavior. To address these objectives, we evaluated adult mice employing a combination of calcium-imaging in astrocytes, and loss- and gain-of-function manipulations to assess synaptic plasticity and behavior in adult mice. First, we found that astrocytes of adult mice display fully functional mGluR5-dependent calcium activity. To examine the role of this activity, we induced the deletion of mGluR5 in astrocytes across the entire brain of adult mice. These mice developed anxious- and depression-like behaviors, along with reduced sociability and recognition memory, but showed increased behavioral flexibility. These results highlighted the hippocampus as a key region for mGluR5-mediated astrocytic influence on behavior, leading us to specifically target hippocampal astrocytes. A viral-driven ablation in this area demonstrated that astrocytic mGluR5 plays a role in both basal transmission and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Behaviorally, the deletion of astrocytic mGluR5 in the hippocampus recapitulated anxious-like behaviors, social deficits, and impaired long-term recognition memory. Surprisingly, it improved place recognition memory but reduced behavioral flexibility. Lastly, overexpressing this receptor to enhance mGluR5 signaling specifically in hippocampal astrocytes impaired place recognition memory but improved behavioral flexibility, revealing a role for astrocytic mGluR5 in regulating these behaviors. Overall, our results confirmed the biological relevance of astrocytic mGluR5 during adulthood, specifically in modulating hippocampal function.

">Brain-Informed Fine-Tuning for Improved Multilingual Understanding in Language Models</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning language models with brain data can improve their semantic understanding, although these findings have so far been limited to English. Interestingly, similar to the shared multilingual embedding space of pretrained multilingual language models, human studies provide strong evidence for a shared semantic system in bilingual individuals. Here, we investigate whether fine-tuning language models with bilingual brain data changes model representations in a way that improves them across multiple languages. To test this, we fine-tune monolingual and multilingual language models using brain activity recorded while bilingual participants read stories in English and Chinese. We then evaluate how well these representations generalize to the bilingual participants' first language, their second language, and several other languages that the participant is not fluent in. We assess the fine-tuned language models on brain encoding performance and downstream NLP tasks. Our results show that bilingual brain-informed fine-tuned language models outperform their vanilla (pretrained) counterparts in both brain encoding performance and most downstream NLP tasks across multiple languages. These findings suggest that brain-informed fine-tuning improves multilingual understanding in language models, offering a bridge between cognitive neuroscience and NLP research.

">Modeling Laryngeal Dystonia through Spectral Analyses of Vocalizations in a Dystonia Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                Laryngeal dystonia is a task-specific, focal dystonia that disrupts vocal-motor control and significantly alters quality of life through impaired communication. Despite its early onset in many hereditary dystonias, effective treatments remain limited, in part due to the lack of a preclinical model that captures its circuit-level pathophysiology. Our experiment evaluates ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in Ptf1aCre/+;Vglut2fl/fl mice, a cerebellum-specific generalized dystonia model, to assess translational relevance for laryngeal dystonia. At postnatal day 9, mutant mice demonstrated statistically significant reductions in total USV count, relative count of complex calls, and key spectral parameters--especially frequency modulation and power--mirroring phonatory abnormalities seen in human patients. Cluster analyses further revealed impaired vocal burst initiation, suggesting disrupted cerebellar coordination of temporal vocal-motor output. These findings support the model's construct and face validity for cerebellar contributions to disordered phonation. By revealing these potential translational biomarkers, our study establishes a foundational platform for future mechanistic and interventional research in laryngeal dystonia.

">Neurocomputational impairments in disambiguation of context as a key determinant of post-traumatic psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                We combine theoretical biology and systems neuroscience to relate the mechanisms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) models to biopsychosocial complexity. Moving beyond fear conditioning, extinction and habits formed by associative learning, we consider conserved neuromodulatory mechanisms related to harm expectation, defensive mobilisation, and context (in)sensitivity. Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating, and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies. The ensuing model plausibly illustrates PTSD pathogenesis, which remains understudied relative to aetiology. We locate pathogenesis in maladaptive precision following traumatic learning, characterised by aberrant Bayesian credit assignment. Future scientific and clinical studies can test the validity of these insights, which could underwrite our understanding of the phenomenology, diagnostics and ultimately treatment intervention in post-traumatic disorders.

">Multiple event segmentation mechanisms in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The human brain segments continuous experience into discrete events, with theoretical accounts proposing two distinct mechanisms: creating boundaries at points of high prediction error (mismatch between expected and observed information) or high prediction uncertainty (reduced precision in predictions). Using fMRI and computational modeling, we investigated the neural correlates of error-driven and uncertainty-driven boundaries. We developed computational models that generate boundaries based on prediction error or prediction uncertainty, and examined how both types of boundaries, and human-identified boundaries, related to fMRI pattern shifts and evoked responses. Multivariate analysis revealed a specific temporal sequence of neural pattern changes around human boundaries: early pattern shifts in anterior temporal regions (-11.9s), followed by shifts in parietal areas (-4.5s), and subsequent whole-brain pattern stabilization (+11.8s). The core of this dynamic response was associated with both error-driven and uncertainty-driven boundaries. Critically, both error- and uncertainty-driven boundaries were associated with unique pattern shifts. Error-driven boundaries were associated with early pattern shifts in ventrolateral prefrontal areas, followed by pattern stabilization in prefrontal and temporal areas. Uncertainty-driven boundaries were linked to shifts in parietal regions within the dorsal attention network, with minimal subsequent stabilization. In addition, within the core regions responsive to both types of boundaries, the timing differed significantly. These findings provide evidence for two overlapping brain networks that maintain and update representations of the environment, controlled by two distinct prediction quality signals: prediction error and prediction uncertainty.

">Altered Stress and Fear Responses in the VPA Rat Model of Autism: Behavioral Dissociation Across Tactile, Nociceptive, and Social Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Sensitivity to environmental stimuli is a fundamental aspect of human behavior, and its dysregulation is associated with stress-related and anxiety disorders. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered sensory processing may contribute to increased vulnerability to such conditions. To better understand this relationship, we evaluated autonomic and behavioral responses to tactile, nociceptive, and social stressors in juvenile Wistar rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a widely used animal model of ASD. VPA-treated and saline-treated control (CTL) rats underwent a battery of stress-related behavioral tests. Defecation, freezing and vocalization behaviors were analyzed in response to handling, electro-tactile stimulation, nociceptive foot shock (fear conditioning) and social stress stimuli (emotional contagion). VPA-treated rats maintained increased defecation during handling and a higher prevalence of defecation during electro-tactile stimulation, without corresponding changes in freezing. During fear conditioning, these animals showed delayed onset and heightened freezing responses. Furthermore, unlike CTL rats, VPA-treated rats lacked correlations among freezing, defecation, and vocalization. In the emotional contagion paradigm, observation of shock in the partner increased the prevalence of animals freezing and reduced the prevalence of animals vocalizing in both VPA and CTL groups (oV+ and oC+) compared to their respective controls (oV- and oC-). However, these effects were more sustained in oV+ rats, which also exhibited prolonged freezing behavior and an earlier reduction in vocalization rate. These findings indicate that VPA-treated rats display heightened stress reactivity, habituation deficit and disrupted coordination of fear responses, supporting the VPA model as a relevant tool for investigating the neurobiological basis of stress vulnerability and social dysfunction in ASD.

">Alterations in Electroencephalography Signals in Female Fragile X Syndrome Mouse Model on a C57Bl/6J Background</a></h4>

              
                Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder, arises from FMR1 gene silencing and exhibits pronounced sex differences in prevalence and phenotypic severity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a promising translational biomarker for FXS pathophysiology, yet prior research has predominantly focused on male cohorts. In the widely used C57Bl/6J (B6) mouse strain, male Fmr1 knockout (KO) models show increased absolute gamma power at both juvenile and adult stages, which may reflect cortical hyperexcitability. In contrast, little is known about female Fmr1 KO mice, except that they exhibit no gamma alterations in adulthood. This gap hinders understanding of sex-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories of EEG profile in FXS. Leveraging the genetic stability and translational relevance of the B6 strain, this study compares EEG profiles between juvenile female Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) B6 mice to address this critical gap. Methods: Frontal-parietal differential EEG was recorded in freely behaving mice using the Open-Source Electrophysiology Recording system for Rodents. Neural activity was analyzed across three recording conditions: in the home cage, light-dark arena, and open field arena. Computed metrics included absolute/relative power, peak alpha frequency, theta-beta ratio, phase-amplitude coupling, amplitude-amplitude coupling, and multiscale entropy to assess signal complexity. Results: In all recording conditions, Fmr1 KO mice exhibited reduced absolute power in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands compared to WT controls. Relative power analysis revealed decreased alpha activity alongside increased gamma-band power, including both low and high gamma, in the KO mice. Cross-frequency coupling was disrupted, with diminished alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. Amplitude-amplitude coupling between theta or alpha and gamma power displayed distinct changes in different recording conditions. Peak alpha frequency and theta-beta ratio were both reduced or unchanged in the KO mice, depending on the recording condition. Finally, EEG signal complexity remained comparable between the two genotypes across the conditions. Behaviorally, KO mice displayed hyper-exploration in the open field test, characterized by increased center time and entries. However, no overall robust correlations between EEG power in different frequency bands and behavioral parameters in the open field test were observed. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that juvenile female Fmr1 KO mice on a B6 background exhibit EEG alterations highly consistent with those reported in FXS patients, particularly increased gamma and reduced alpha power. The robust increase in gamma activity reinforces its status as a reliable biomarker across preclinical and clinical studies, while alpha reductions and slowed peak alpha frequency implicate thalamocortical network involvement. Together, these findings highlight the translational value of this model for studying core circuit dysfunctions in FXS.

">Global error signal guides local optimization in mismatch calculation</a></h4>

              
                Corollary discharge denotes internal signals about the expected sensory consequences of one's own actions, leading to attenuation of sensory responses caused by self-produced stimulation. To investigate the underlying neural circuit mechanism, here we introduce a biologically plausible three-factor learning rule, where a global signal guides the updating of local inhibitory synapses to enable the computation of mismatch between a stimulus and its expectation or prediction. We show that our network model, endowed with positive and negative prediction error neurons, accounts for the salient physiological observations of motor-visual and motor-auditory mismatch responses in mice. Moreover, the model predicts that learning induces a bimodal distribution in activity correlation with stimulus and movement-induced prediction, supported by our analysis of neural data from a recent experiment. These results link global modulation to local learning for predictive error computation in the sensory areas, and shed insights into how disrupting inhibition impairs mismatch computation in specific ways.

">β-adrenergic receptors modulate CA1 population coding during cumulative spatial memory formation and updating</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal neuronal ensembles are likely to support the acquisition, stabilization and updating of spatial experience. Spatial learning is typically cumulative, but little is known about how neuronal ensembles are manifested during this process. Here, we used wide-field Ca2+-imaging to monitor CA1 pyramidal cells during cumulative item-place learning in adult male CBA/CaOlaHsd mice. In control mice, initial learning prompted activity in a population of CA1 neurons, some of which re-appeared during re-exposure to the same item-place configuration 60 min after 1st exposure. Item-place reconfiguration (60 min later) caused a change in population dynamics as reflected by alterations in neuronal recruitment and reactivation patterns. Place cell-like properties, population burst activity, and functional connectivity were consistent with the encoding and updating of item-place memory. To examine the role of noradrenergic neuromodulation on these processes, we pharmacologically antagonized {beta}-adrenergic receptors({beta}-AR) prior to the 1st item-place exposure. This led to reduced cellular recruitment, disrupted ensemble reactivation, reduced spatial tuning, dampened population bursts, and altered functional connectivity within neurons. This was accompanied by impaired spatial learning compared to controls. Our results reveal the population activity of CA1 neurons during item-place learning and show that {beta}-AR support memory function by influencing both neuronal and network-level dynamics.

">Robust Neural Decoding with low density EEG</a></h4>

              
                High-density EEG recording enhances spatial resolution for neural signal decoding, yet the relationship between electrode density and decoding performance, as well as the minimum number of electrodes required for effective decoding, remains unclear. To address this, we systematically investigated the decoding accuracy of neural signals across varying electrode densities (16, 32, 64, 96, and 128 electrodes) using visual grating stimuli characterized by orientation, contrast, spatial frequency, and color. Our findings showed that accurate decoding of these visual grating features was achievable even with as few as 16 electrodes, highlighting the robustness of decodable neural signals. To test the generalization of these results to more complex natural stimuli, we conducted a similar analysis with a diverse set of naturalistic images categorizable into living/non-living and moving/non-moving. The results consistently showed that effective decoding persists even with only 16 electrodes, demonstrating robust decoding efficacy even for complex naturalistic stimuli. This work provides valuable insights into the efficient neural decoding offered by low-density EEG and robustness of neural signal representation.

">High-pass noise suppression in the mosquito auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Mosquitoes detect sound with their antennae, which transmit vibrations to mechanosensory neurons in Johnston's organ. However, their auditory system is exposed to low-frequency noise from external sources, such as convective and thermal noise, and internal sources, such as flight-induced noise, which could impair sensitivity. High-pass filters (HPFs) may mitigate this issue by suppressing low-frequency interference before it is transformed into neuronal signals. We investigated HPF mechanisms in Culex pipiens mosquitoes by analyzing the phase-frequency characteristics of the primary sensory neurons in the Johnston's organ. Electrophysiological recordings from male and female mosquitoes revealed phase shifts consistent with high-pass filtering. Initial modeling suggested a single HPF; however, experimental data required revising the model to include two serially connected HPFs to account for phase shifts exceeding -90{degrees}. The results showed that male mosquitoes exhibit stronger low-frequency suppression (~32 dB at 10 Hz) compared to females (~21 dB), with some female neurons showing negligible filtering. The estimated delay in signal transmission was ~7 ms for both sexes. These findings suggest that HPFs enhance noise immunity, particularly in males, whose auditory sensitivity is critical for mating. The diversity in female neuronal tuning may reflect broader auditory functions in addition to mating, such as host detection. This study provides indirect evidence for HPFs in mosquito hearing and highlights sex-specific adaptations in auditory processing. The proposed dual-HPF model improves our understanding of how mosquitoes maintain high auditory sensitivity in noisy environments.

">Altered lysosomal biology impairs motor neuron survival via TFEB dysregulation in spinal muscular atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating motor neuron disease, caused by recessive mutations or deletions of the SMN1 gene, representing the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. Available therapies, aimed at increasing SMN protein levels, can only partially halt motor neuron (MN) degeneration in a select number of patients, reinforcing the need for combinatorial treatments to improve clinical outcomes. We previously showed that mTORC1 overactivation and impaired autophagosome clearance in SMA MNs lead to the accumulation of protein aggregates, contributing to MN degeneration. However, the mechanistic link between SMN protein deficiency and autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction remained unknown. Here, using patient iPSC-derived MNs along with isogenic and healthy controls, we show that SMA MNs exhibit reduced lysosome numbers and impaired functionality. Furthermore, the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, TFEB, is downregulated, and its nuclear translocation compromised upon SMN deficiency. We further propose the upregulation of the mTORC1 positive modulator TPT1 as contributor to TFEB dysregulation. Notably, TFEB overexpression ameliorates protein aggregate accumulation in SMA MNs and enhances MN survival both in vitro and in a zebrafish SMA model. Our findings identify lysosomal dysfunction as a key player in SMA pathology and highlight TFEB activation as a potential therapeutic strategy for SMA treatment.

">Identification of functional neural networks of human brains with fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The highly evolved human brain comprises numerous functional systems, ranging from essential sensory, motor, attention and memory networks to higher-order cognitive functions like reasoning and language. Although these neural systems and cognitive functions are separately distributed across the entire brain, they are functionally integrated together to perform a task. Decision-making and executive functioning may also be involved in performing the task. While studying task-evoked brain networks is important, investigating whole-brain activity could be crucial for understanding the neural underpinnings of individual behavioral and clinical traits. Even when the brain is not actively engaged in a task, the intrinsic neural activity, i.e., the resting-state (rs) activity, maintains the operations of the brain that involve the acquisition and maintenance of information for interpreting, responding to, and predicting environmental demands. This intrinsic activity is also functionally organized into networks like the brain default mode network. Investigating its whole-brain activity could also be crucial for understanding the neural underpinnings of the operations of the brain at rest. We report a novel data-driven method to objectively and automatically identify functional neural networks (FNNs) across the entire brain for both brain states measured with rs- and task-fMRI, respectively. The identified FNNs characterize the whole-brain activity holistically for each brain state and each individual subject.

">Tonic GABAA receptor currents in Cerebellar Purkinje cells of wild-type and DMDmdx mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) fire spontaneously in the absence of excitatory input and depend heavily on inhibition to modify their firing activity. Previous work in the field has described phasic inhibition arising primarily from molecular layer interneuron-PC (MLI-PC) synapses extensively, however little work explores other sources of inhibition in PCs. Several types of neurons throughout the brain and within the cerebellum receive significant inhibition through tonic currents, a low amplitude current resulting from ambient GABA acting upon extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Through the use of ex vivo electrophysiology and single cell RNA analysis, we investigated the role of tonic inhibition in PCs. We find that PCs have a significant tonic current mediated by {delta}-subunit containing GABAA receptors, which accounts for roughly half of the total inhibitory current. We also examined PC tonic GABA currents in DMDmdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy with ~50% reduction in phasic inhibitory currents. We find that tonic inhibition is dramatically upregulated in DMDmdx PCs, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism to account for the loss in phasic inhibition. Furthermore, roughly 80% of the total inhibition is derived from tonic currents in this condition. These data suggest that under physiological conditions, PCs are subject to both tonic and phasic inhibition, and that adjustments in the balance of inhibition may be a physiological mechanism for PC function. These data reveal an expanded range of inhibitory currents in PC which may be critical to regulating PC activity in both normal and pathophysiological states.

">Intertemporal choice across short and long time horizons: an fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                This preregistered fMRI study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying intertemporal choices involving waiting and postponing. On a behavioral level, choices made regarding rewards available in seconds that require waiting compared to choices about rewards postponed to a number days are surprisingly similar. The explanation to this short/long time scales gap is lacking even after considering time perception and external factors, such as stress. To address that this study is the first to examine the overlapping and distinct neural circuitry involved in the intertemporal choices over seconds and days, and the waiting period within subject. Our results revealed considerable overlap in brain activation during choices that consider seconds and days delays to reward in the executive control (dACC, dlPFC) and prospection (PCC/precuneus, dmPFC) networks, but not in the valuation network. Consistent with existent literature we found the valuation network activation (both vmPFC and ventral striatum) being parametrically modulated by individual subjective values of delayed rewards. Overall, the key network determined through representational similarity and decoding analyses was prospection accounting for similarity in activation during decision making across time scales of delays and discriminating between waiting and postponing the reward. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural underpinnings of intertemporal choices and their implications for real-life decisions occurring across varying time horizons, such as paying to skip advertisements while watching videos or deciding on the next-day delivery service.

">Contributions from Long-Term Memory Explain Superior Visual Working Memory Performance with Meaningful Objects</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (WM) capacity has recently been claimed to be higher for meaningful objects compared to simple visual features, possibly due to richer and more distinctive representations. However, prior demonstrations of this advantage have typically compared performance with meaningful stimuli that are trial-unique to performance with a small set of repeated simple stimuli (e.g., colors). This design creates a confound between the strength of proactive interference (PI) and meaningfulness, such that PI is minimized for meaningful items compared to colors. Thus, improved WM performance with meaningful objects could reflect enhanced contributions from episodic long term memory (LTM), a memory system that is highly vulnerable to PI, rather than an increase in WM capacity. To examine this issue, Experiment 1 measured WM capacity for repeated colors, repeated meaningful objects, and trial-unique meaningful objects. We replicated the previously observed advantage for trial-unique objects over colors. Critically, this advantage was eliminated entirely with repeated meaningful objects that equated PI across the meaningful and simple stimuli, suggesting that minimal PI, not meaningfulness, drove this behavioral effect. In line with this hypothesis, hierarchical Bayesian dual-process signal detection modeling suggested that the advantage for trial-unique objects was due to enhanced familiarity-based LTM signals rather than recollection-based WM processes. To directly measure online storage in WM, Experiment 2 measured contralateral delay activity (CDA), an electrophysiological marker of the number of items stored in working memory. Although we saw the typical performance benefits for trial-unique objects over repeated colors, CDA activity across increasing set sizes revealed a common plateau for trial-unique meaningful objects and repeated colors, indicating a WM storage limit that is independent of stimulus meaningfulness. Thus, past demonstrations of superior memory performance with meaningful stimuli can be explained by a task design that minimized PI for meaningful compared to simple stimuli. When PI is equated, WM storage limits for simple and meaningful stimuli are equivalent.

">Administration of barcoded AAV capsid library to the putamen of non-human primates identifies variants with efficient retrograde transport</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated viral vectors have become a leading choice for gene therapy in the central nervous system due to their safety profile, efficient neuronal transduction, and capacity for sustained transgene expression. We previously reported that AAV2-derived capsids developed using the BRAVE (Barcoded Rational AAV Vector Evolution) approach have enhanced retrograde transport properties in the rodent brain, compared to parental AAV2. Retrograde transport enables broader coverage of connected brain regions after a single focal intraparenchymal brain injection and is therefore a powerful tool for delivery of vectors to distant sites with potentially higher specificity, transduction efficacy and safety. Because transport properties can vary among species, we further characterized a barcoded library of 25 BRAVE-derived AAV2 capsid variants, along with the parental AAV2 serotype and benchmark AAV capsids, in brains of adult cynomolgus monkeys after intraputaminal dosing. Based on RNA and DNA amplicon sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and histological assessment, we report here capsid variants with enhanced retrograde transport and expression compared to the parental AAV2 capsid. These properties make them potentially useful for disease indications in which broader brain coverage is desirable beyond the injection site.

                Despite advances in delineating the molecular diversity and projection patterns of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons, their specific contributions to locomotion and motor learning remain poorly defined. Here, we applied intersectional ablation and chemogenetic approaches to dissect the distinct roles of calbindin-expressing (CALB1+) and non-expressing (CALB1-) DA neurons in locomotion. Using newly engineered intersectional constructs, we ablated CALB1+ or CALB1- DA neurons in the mouse midbrain. Loss of either subtype led to pronounced deficits in the initiation and vigor of voluntary movements, as demonstrated by a reduction in peak speed, acceleration and deceleration of locomotor bouts. Notably, only CALB1- ablation disrupted locomotor learning. Beyond these functional effects, we observed that selective ablation of CALB1 DA neurons induced local microglial activation and was followed by a non-cell-autonomous loss of CALB1- DA neurons, suggesting that CALB1- neurons are more vulnerable to inflammation triggered by CALB1 neuron loss. We then confirmed these findings by performing acute inhibition of either population using inhibitory DREADD hM4Di. CALB1- DA neurons inhibition impaired the initial acquisition of locomotor learning, whereas inhibition of CALB1+ DA neurons disrupted the retention of acquired motor skills from previous days. Moreover, inhibition of CALB1+ DA neurons further impaired the initiation and amplitude of voluntary movements, as well as the velocity and acceleration/deceleration of locomotor bouts. Together, these findings provide causal evidence for functional specialization among molecularly distinct midbrain DA subtypes and reveal new aspects of mesostriatal circuit organization underlying locomotion and motor memory.

">Precision Functional Mapping of the Individual Human Brain Near Birth</a></h4>

              
                Cortical areas are a fundamental organizational property of the brain, but their development in humans is not well understood. Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

">Place cell activity and behaviour during task acquisition and extinction learning predict renewal outcome</a></h4>

              
                Extinction learning (EL) and the subsequent renewal of learned behaviours are crucial for adaptive responding, yet the underlying neural mechanisms that differentiate successful renewal from its absence remain unclear. Here, we explored the behavioral and neurophysiological basis of spatial appetitive EL, as well as renewal failure and renewal success. We recorded place cell activity from hippocampal area CA1 in male rats that performed a context-dependent spatial appetitive learning task in a T-maze (rewarded context A), followed by EL (unrewarded context B), and subsequent renewal testing (unrewarded context A). Half of the animals exhibited significant renewal (renewers) and the other half failed to renew (non-renewers). Our findings reveal fundamental differences in learning strategies between groups revealed by differences in both spatial behavior and in place cell activity during both initial acquisition and subsequent EL. Specifically, renewers exhibited a context-based EL strategy, whereas non-renewers followed a goal-directed strategy. The spatial distribution of hippocampal place cell activity differed significantly between groups, indicating the hippocampus' role in the learning processes. Furthermore, renewers exhibited a greater extent of global remapping of place cells compared to non-renewers, consistent with predictions by our computational modeling. This suggests that global remapping serves as a key neural mechanism underlying effective renewal, allowing for the segregation of distinct memories and preventing the generalization of extinction. Our results highlight how hippocampal place cell dynamics during acquisition and EL predict later behavioral renewal outcomes, providing critical insights into the neural basis of memory updating and contextual control over learned behaviors.

">Temporal presence does not affect behavioral and neurophysiological indices of pain empathy</a></h4>

              
                The impact of digitally mediated social interaction on understanding others and sharing their emotions has not been thoroughly investigated. We examined how live, video-mediated interaction as opposed to watching a prerecorded video, affects behavioral, neural, and physiological aspects of empathy for pain. Thirty-five observers watched targets undergoing painful electric stimulation in an electroencephalogram study. We hypothesized that reduced temporal presence would result in diminished behavioral and electrophysiological empathic responses. However, observer's behavioral empathic responses were not diminished with reduced temporal presence. On a neural level, mid-frontal theta was sensitive to the other's pain intensity, and we observed significant physiological coupling between participants. Mu suppression, on the other hand, was not modulated by pain intensity. Importantly, neural and physiological indices of empathy were independent of temporal presence. However, exploratory analyses indicated a latency effect of temporal presence on pain-related theta activity with an earlier theta increase in interactions with high temporal presence. The results suggest that the temporal presence of individuals may not be necessary for empathy towards another's pain. Future studies may investigate more naturalistic social interactions and include motivational aspects of empathy. We discuss implications of these findings for debates on social presence and on second-person neuroscience.

">Effective connectivity reveals dual-route mechanism of visual prediction precision via insula and pulvinar</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to weight predictions by their precision is a central mechanism in predictive processing, enabling optimal integration of prior expectations with incoming sensory input. Despite its theoretical significance, the neural circuitry that implements precision-weighted prediction remains unclear. Using 7-Tesla fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), this study investigated how the brain encodes the precision of predictions during a visual cueing task with high- and low-precision conditions. We focused on the key regions implicated in predictive processing: the insular cortex, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and primary visual cortex (V1). Behaviourally, participants showed significantly greater accuracy in the high-precision condition (p < .001), confirming effective task manipulation. DCM analyses revealed that high-precision predictions elicited excitatory modulation of connectivity from the insula to V1 (Pp = .95), alongside inhibitory influences from the insula to the pulvinar (Pp = .99) and from the pulvinar to V1 (Pp = .89). Furthermore, leave-one-out cross validation revealed that individual differences in behavioural sensitivity to precision were positively predicted by pulvinar-to-insula connectivity (r = .36, p = .026) and negatively predicted by the connectivity between pulvinar and V1 (pulvinar to V1: r = .35, p = .033; V1 to pulvinar: r = .37, p = .026), highlighting the behavioural relevance of these pathways. Together, these findings suggest a dual-route mechanism whereby the insula directly enhances top-down predictions in V1 while indirectly dampening bottom-up sensory input via the pulvinar. This mechanism may facilitate Bayesian integration under uncertainty and offers new hypotheses into how precision weighting may be disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions.

">Robust maintenance of both stimulus location and amplitude in a working memory model based on dendritic bistability</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is a core feature of cognition that enables items to be maintained and manipulated over short durations of time. Stored information can be binary, such as the presence or absence of an object, or multivalued, such as the graded intensity or location of a feature. Remarkably, there are currently no computational models of working memory that can robustly maintain both the graded intensity and spatial location of a stored item. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome if neurons contain multiple bistable dendritic compartments. We first illustrate the core mechanism in a simple network architecture for both a spiking model with conductance-based dendrites and a rate-based model that permits analytic understanding. We then implement this mechanism within a ring model architecture for spatial working memory, in which neurons are arranged in a one-dimensional line or ring such that the spatial location of an item is encoded by the set of neurons that are active. In contrast to classic ring models, which encode the binary presence and continuous location of an item, we show that the multi-dendrite-neuron model can robustly (without fine tuning and with minimal drift in response to noise) encode both the amplitude and the location of an item in working memory. This work provides a solution to the problem of encoding graded information in spatial working memory and demonstrates how dendritic computation can increase the capacity and robustness of working memory.

">Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation during movement modulates motor neural circuitry without widespread cortical or autonomic activation</a></h4>

              
                Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a promising neuromodulatory approach for treating neurological disorders, with growing interest in its potential to support motor rehabilitation. Yet, its mechanisms of action, potentially influenced by behavioral context, remain elusive. This sham-controlled study investigated transient taVNS interactions with movement in healthy adults, focusing on autonomic, neuromodulatory, and motor circuits. During a finger-tapping paradigm, heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), pupil diameter, and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded to probe movement-dependent stimulation effects. This study first identified a novel physiological dissociation: all measures responded to movement, but taVNS did not significantly alter HR, GSR, or general EEG spectral slope; taVNS increased pupil diameter in both conditions, but enhanced sensorimotor EEG spectral slope solely during movement. This context-specific effect on motor systems was further supported by a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment demonstrating increased corticospinal excitability during taVNS. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how taVNS may selectively enhance motor system responsiveness during active states, supporting future exploration of behaviorally paired stimulation protocols for neurorehabilitation.

">A meta-analysis of periodic and aperiodic M/EEG components in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease is characterised by a range of motor and non-motor changes that can negatively impact quality of life. Many studies have identified potential clinical electrophysiological biomarkers of Parkinson's disease with an aim of developing new methods of identifying at-risk patients, and to form the basis of therapeutic interventions. However, these studies do not present consistent results, and a formal meta-analysis is warranted to identify reliable M/EEG characteristics across datasets. In this meta-(re-)analysis of open-access M/EEG datasets (n = 6; 4 EEG and 2 MEG), we compared periodic and aperiodic characteristics of resting-state recordings in 368 patients with Parkinson's disease and 570 age-matched healthy controls. Specifically, we compared the power and peak frequency of the aperiodic-adjusted alpha and beta oscillations, and the aperiodic exponent and offset across the two groups. Using spectral parametrisation, individuals with Parkinson's disease had higher alpha-band power and a slower alpha peak frequency compared to controls, however no group differences in beta-band power and peak frequency were identified in this resting state data. Parkinson's patients were furthermore found to have consistently higher aperiodic offset and exponent, possibly indicative of increased cortical inhibition. In conclusion, this large cohort meta-analysis points to a broadly consistent pattern of both periodic and aperiodic changes in Parkinson's patients in M/EEG signal that may be used to develop diagnostics and targeted interventions in the future.

">Canonical recurrent neural circuits: A unified sampling machine for static and dynamic inference</a></h4>

              
                The brain lives in an ever-changing world and needs to infer the dynamic evolution of latent states from noisy sensory inputs. Exploring how canonical recurrent neural circuits in the brain realize dynamic inference is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Nearly all existing studies on dynamic inference focus on deterministic algorithms, whereas cortical circuits are intrinsically stochastic, with accumulating evidence suggesting that they employ stochastic Bayesian sampling algorithms. Nevertheless, nearly all circuit sampling studies focused on static inference with fixed posterior over time instead of dynamic inference, leaving a gap between circuit sampling and dynamic inference. To bridge this gap, we study the sampling-based dynamic inference in a canonical recurrent circuit model with excitatory (E) neurons and two types of inhibitory interneurons: parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) neurons. We find that the canonical circuit unifies Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling to infer either static or dynamic latent states with various moving speeds. Remarkably, switching sampling algorithms and adjusting model's internal latent moving speed can be realized by modulating the gain of SOM neurons without changing synaptic weights. Moreover, when the circuit employs Hamiltonian sampling, its sampling trajectories oscillate around the true latent moving state, resembling the decoded spatial trajectories from hippocampal theta sequences. Our work provides overarching connections between the canonical circuit with diverse interneurons and sampling-based dynamic inference, deepening our understanding of the circuit implementation of Bayesian sampling.

">Avoidance engages dopaminergic punishment in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                It was classically suggested that behaviour can cause emotions (Darwin 1872). For example, smiling can make us feel happier, and in rodents the induced patterns of cardiac activity and breathing that are indicative of fear can in turn evoke it (Coles et al. 2022, Hsueh et al. 2023, Jhang et al. 2024). However, the adaptive significance of such feedback is unclear. We show that inducing backward movement, an element of avoidance behaviour in Drosophila, engages negative valence signals in these animals, and reveal the neuronal mechanisms and adaptive significance of this effect. We develop a paradigm with odours as conditioned stimuli paired with optogenetically induced backward movement instead of a punishing unconditioned stimulus, and combined these experiments with pharmacology, high-resolution video tracking, functional imaging, connectome analyses, and modelling. Our results show that backward movement engages dopaminergic punishment neurons and supports aversive memories. Such avoidance-to-punishment feedback counterbalances extinction learning and maintains learned avoidance, reducing the risk of further punishment. This can explain the long-standing 'avoidance paradox', the observation that avoidance adaptively persists even when it is successful and no punishment is received (Bolles 1972). Our results provide a neurobiologically grounded argument for an integrated view of behaviour organization and valence processing.

                Background: Previous resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) studies have identified a robust inverse relationship between nodal strength and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across cortical modules. This study examined whether this negative relationship also within modules, to evaluate the validity of functional parcellation (FP) as a preprocessing step for neural network construction, and explored age-related effects on these associations. Methods: Using MOSI (modularity analysis and similarity measurements), rsfMRI data from three public datasets spanning different age cohorts were analyzed. Correlations between nodal strength (or voxel concordance within modules) and ALFF were calculated. Geometric mean p-values assessed robustness at the individual level. Results: Confirming prior findings, a significant inverse correlation between nodal strength and ALFF was observed at the between-module level (geometric p-values 10-4 to 10-5). Within-module negative associations were nonsignificant in younger cohorts (mean ages 10 and 21) but became significant in the older cohort (mean age 33). The magnitude of this negative association increased with age, consistent with maturation of local inhibitory network mechanisms. Conclusions: The findings support FP as a valid preprocessing method, with within-module inhibitory effects strengthening in adulthood. The age-dependent modulation suggests network maturation impacts local neural activity regulation, with implications for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Numerosity estimation refers to the ability to perceive and estimate quantities without explicit counting, a skill crucial for both human and animal cognition. Traditionally, this process has been associated with higher-order cortical regions like the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), thought to support abstract number representations. However, noninvasive electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, along with psychophysical investigations, suggest that early visual areas such as V1 and V2 may play a role in processing visual numerosity, similar to the way low-level visual features are encoded. Recent research shows that the early visual cortex encodes information related to numerosity through the spatial frequency content of visual displays. Numerosity-tuned neurons, however, emerge later in the visual processing hierarchy, where more abstract and location-independent representations are formed in association areas such as the IPS and PFC. This is further supported by single-neuron data revealing spatiotopic integration and tuning curves for specific numerosities within these associative cortical regions. A comprehensive understanding of numerosity processing in the brain requires investigating numerosity presentations across time, space, and sensory modalities, all of which engage association cortices rather than sensory-specific regions.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Inhibitory control and perception-action integration are fundamental components of executive function, supported by distinct neural mechanisms. This study investigates the roles of theta and alpha oscillations in these processes during a Go/Nogo task, with a sample size of 73 healthy participants, using a novel application of non-negative tensor decomposition. The Non-negative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC algorithm was applied to multi-dimensional EEG data to preserve critical spatial, temporal, and spectral information. Results revealed that mid-frontal theta band activity is strongly associated with the reconfiguration of perception-action associations, particularly during overlapping Nogo trials, where cognitive demands are heightened. Alpha band activity, while less prominent, was also detected, indicating its involvement in top-down inhibitory control during conditions requiring less cognitive reconfiguration. These findings suggest complementary roles for theta and alpha oscillations, with theta playing a dominant role in managing perception-action associations. Tensor decomposition provides an effective means to capture complex neural signatures, offering deeper insights into the oscillatory dynamics that underlie cognitive control processes. This method may improve our understanding of EEG data and validate previous findings on neurophysiological functions in cognitive neuroscience.</span>

                <p>Sensorimotor integration processes are crucial for daily-life activities, such as grasping objects or driving a car. Theta band activity (TBA) in distributed brain networks is likely essential to perform sensorimotor integration successfully. Directed communication in these brain networks is shaped by brain maturation during adolescence. This study investigates how age-related effects attributable to brain maturation influence directed communication in a theta-associated sensorimotor integration network. We conducted an EEG study with a continuous pursuit-tracking task performed by an adult group (<I>n</I> = 41) and an adolescent group (<I>n</I> = 30), each including both sexes. Both groups show elevated theta band activity during higher sensorimotor demands. Yet, the adult group outperformed the adolescent group, particularly during higher demands. Further analyses revealed that this is likely due to enhanced directed connectivity between frontal areas and the ventral processing stream in adults, which likely enables effective integration of visual and motor information. Adolescents rely on frontal TBA signaling surprise and prediction error, with no input from ventral stream areas. This might cause lower performance during higher demands. Across age, TBA appears to serve distinct functions during sensorimotor integration. Age-related processes transform the neural processes underlying complex sensorimotor integration.</p>

                <p>The circadian rhythm shapes behavioral processes by providing temporal cues for molecular regulation and adaptation in the hypothalamus of the brain. Deeper yet in the striatum of the brain, circadian rhythm also exerts an impact, conditioning diurnal patterns in neurodegenerative-related motor dysfunction. While motor properties are clearly linked to striatal dopamine, the interplay between the circadian rhythm with the key circadian transcription factor Bmal1 and dopamine signal decoding remains unknown. Here, we utilized both sexes of global and local striatal Bmal1 knock-out mice to investigate changes in dopamine-mediated cAMP signaling and motor behavior. By conducting a 24&nbsp;h time-course study, we first established Bmal1-dependent molecular signatures in striatal dopamine signaling machinery that correlated with cAMP levels. Next, recording real-time signal transduction with a two-photon FRET biosensor in brain slices revealed diminished efficacy of dopamine signaling in the absence of Bmal1. As a final functional outcome, we then found that striatal Bmal1 was necessary for motor learning in mice. Altogether, our data support a strong connection between striatal Bmal1 and dopamine signaling with potential impact in brain-related motor function.</p>

                <p>The error negativity or error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in choice tasks, is related to posterror adjustments indicating that it signals the need for behavioral adjustments following errors. However, little is known about how the error monitoring system selects appropriate posterror adjustments for a given error to ensure that future errors are effectively prevented. This could be achieved by monitoring error precursors indicating potential error sources and then scaling the Ne/ERN according to the strength of the error precursor upon error occurrence. We isolated such an error precursor in alpha oscillations and tested whether it predicts the size of the Ne/ERN. A total of 28 participants (23 female, 5 male) had to classify a target in one hemifield but ignore a distractor in the opposite hemifield. Because responding to the distractor always led to an error, misallocating spatial attention to the distractor as reflected in posterior alpha was a viable error precursor in this paradigm. We found that an alpha asymmetry reversal indicated a shift of spatial attention to the distractor on error trials and predicted the Ne/ERN on a single-trial level. The Ne/ERN in turn predicted alpha asymmetry on the next trial indicating a shift of spatial attention away from the distractor. This is consistent with the idea that the error monitoring system scales the Ne/ERN according to the strength of error precursors to select appropriate posterror adjustments of behavior.</p>

                <p>Visual information consists of static and dynamic properties. How is their representation organized in the visual system? Static information has been associated with ventral temporal regions while dynamic information with lateral and dorsal regions. Investigating the representation of static and dynamic information is complicated by the correlation between static and dynamic information within continuous visual input. Here, we used two-stream deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to separate static and dynamic features in quasi-naturalistic videos and to investigate their neural representations. The first DCNN stream was trained to represent static features by recognizing action labels using individual video frames, and the second DCNN stream was trained to encode dynamic features by recognizing actions from optic flow information that describes changes across different frames. To investigate the representation of these different types of features in the visual system, we used representational similarity analysis to compare the neural network models to the neural responses in different visual pathways of 14 human participants (six females). First, we found that both static and dynamic features are encoded across all visual pathways. Second, we found that distinct visual pathways represent overlapping as well as unique static and dynamic visual information. Finally, multivariate analysis revealed that ventral and dorsal visual pathways share a similar posterior-to-anterior gradient in the representation of static and dynamic visual features.</p>

                <p>Opioid abuse poses a major healthcare challenge. To meet this challenge, the brain mechanisms underlying opioid abuse need to be more systematically characterized. It is commonly thought that the addictive potential of opioids stems from their ability to enhance the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Indeed, activation of mu opioid receptors (MORs) disinhibits VTA dopaminergic neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens, providing a substrate for the rewarding effects of opioids. However, the abuse potential of opioids has also been linked to their ability to suppress pain and aversive states. Although medial VTA dopaminergic neurons are commonly excited by aversive stimuli, the effects of MOR signaling on this circuitry have not been systematically explored. To fill this gap, a combination of anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches were used to study the afferent circuitry of paranigral VTA (pnVTA) dopaminergic neurons and its modulation by MOR signaling in male and female mice. These studies revealed that aversion-linked glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and lateral habenula innervated a subset of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons and that activation of presynaptic MORs suppressed their ability to drive pnVTA spiking. A distinct set of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons were innervated by lateral hypothalamus GABAergic neurons, which also were subject to MOR modulation. Thus, MORs robustly inhibit the ability of brain circuits coding aversive states to drive the activity of pnVTA dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that the addictive potential of opioids may stem in part from their ability to act as negative reinforcers.</p>

                <p>It remains an open question in visual neuroscience whether the recognition of written words and visual objects engages distinct neural mechanisms intrinsically, unaffected by confounding factors such as stimulus properties and task demands, and, if so, where these differences are localized. Previous studies comparing these two processes have faced challenges in simultaneously controlling stimulus properties, including low-level visual features and high-level phonological and semantic attributes, as well as task demands. Here, we addressed these issues using Chinese pictographs, visually identical stimuli that can be interpreted either as words (lexical symbols) or as objects (visual depictions) and that were rigorously matched in a visual form, phonology, and semantics. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 36 male and female human participants performed three language tasks (realness judgment, sound retrieval, and meaning judgment) on pictographs that were contextually recognized as words or objects, with each task applied to both recognition types under identical procedures. Results revealed robust word&ndash;object differences in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and their associated networks. Compared with object recognition, word recognition elicited stronger activation in the IPL and reduced deactivation in the ACC. Furthermore, both regions exhibited distinct multivoxel activation patterns between the word and object recognition and showed stronger functional connectivity with other brain regions specifically during word recognition. This study provides well-controlled evidence for intrinsic neural dissociations between word and object recognition, highlighting a parietal&ndash;cingulate network as a core substrate differentiating these processes.</p>

                <p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is primarily regulated by the brainstem pons. In particular, the sublaterodorsal tegmentum (SubLDT) in the dorsal pons contains neurons whose activity is selective to REM sleep. Elucidation of the precise identities of these neurons and their roles in REM sleep regulation is challenging, however, due to the functional and molecular heterogeneity of the SubLDT. A recent study revealed that corticotropin-releasing hormone&ndash;binding protein (<I>Crhbp</I>)-positive neurons in the SubLDT projecting to the medulla play a crucial role in REM sleep regulation and that loss of these <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons underlies sleep deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. The firing patterns of these neurons during sleep/wake, however, remained unknown. Here, we used an opto-tagging method and conducted cell-type-specific recordings from <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons using a glass pipette microelectrode in unanesthetized male mice. We recorded 58 <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons and found that many of these neurons are REM sleep-active neurons (41.4%) and that the remaining neurons are mostly either wake-active, wake/REM sleep-active, or non-REM sleep-active. In addition, projection-specific recordings revealed that the medulla-projecting <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons are mostly REM sleep-active neurons (75.0%). Based on clustering analysis and spike waveform analysis, REM sleep-active <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons can be further divided into different subtypes according to their electrophysiological properties, suggesting that <I>Crhbp</I>-positive neurons play diverse roles in REM sleep regulation.</p>

                <p>The removal of no-longer-relevant information from visual working memory (WM) is important for the functioning of WM, given its severe capacity limitation. Previously, with an "ABC-retrocuing" WM task, we have shown that removing information can be accomplished in different ways: by simply withdrawing attention from the newly irrelevant memory item (IMI; i.e., via "passive removal") or by "actively" removing the IMI from WM (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B33">Shan and Postle, 2022</cross-ref>). Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms behind active removal, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from human subjects (both sexes) performing the ABC-retrocuing task. Specifically, we tested the hijacked adaptation model, which posits that active removal is accomplished by a top-down-triggered down-modulation of the gain of perceptual circuits, such that sensory channels tuned to the to-be-removed information become less sensitive. Behaviorally, analyses revealed that, relative to passive removal, active removal produced a decline in the familiarity landscape centered on the IMI. Neurally, we focused on two epochs of the task, corresponding to the triggering, and to the consequence, of active removal. With regard to triggering, we observed a stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling wave for active versus passive removal. With regard to the consequence(s) of removal, the response to a task-irrelevant "ping" was reduced for active removal, as assessed with ERP, suggesting that active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the IMI.</p>

                <p>Recent fMRI studies reported transformed representations between perception and visual working memory (VWM) in the human early visual cortex (EVC). This is inconsistent with the still widely cited original proposal of the sensory account of VWM, which argues for a shared perception-VWM representation based on successful cross-decoding of the two representations. Although cross-decoding was usually lower than within-VWM decoding and consistent with transformed VWM representations, this has been attributed to experimental differences between perceptual and VWM tasks: once they are equated, the same representation is expected to exist in both. Including human participants of both sexes, this study compared target and distractor representations during the same VWM delay period for the same objects, thereby equating experimental differences. Even with strong VWM representations present throughout the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC, including EVC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), fMRI cross-decoding revealed significant representational differences between distractors (perception) and targets (VWM) in both regions. Similar differences existed between target encoding (perception) and delay (VWM), being greater in OTC than PPC, indicating more invariant target representations in PPC than OTC. As only part of the sensory input is usually task-relevant, sustaining sensory input in VWM without selection/refinement/consolidation is both taxing and unnecessary. Transformed representations, mediated by task goals and associative areas coding task-relevant information (e.g., PPC), can easily account for these and other recent findings. A task-driven transformed account of VWM thus better captures the nature of VWM representation in the human brain (including EVC) than the sensory representations originally proposed by the sensory account of VWM.</p>

                <p>Humans exhibit laterality preferences, with handedness being the most extensively studied. Accordingly, brain&ndash;handedness associations are well documented. However, laterality preferences extend beyond handedness to include other limbs, such as footedness and eyedness. Despite these distinctions, brain&ndash;footedness and brain&ndash;eyedness associations using resting-state functional connectomes remain largely unexplored. We utilize two large datasets, the Human Connectome Project-Development (HCP-D) and Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-A), to study the associations between sidedness (i.e., handedness, footedness, and eyedness) and whole-brain functional connectomes. While hand and foot preferences were correlated significantly, they explained &lt;40% of the variance, suggesting some distinctions between measures. For both cohorts, significant associations between handedness connectivity were observed [<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, network-based statistics (NBS) corrected]. Notable patterns include increased connectivity for left-handedness in the posterior temporal areas and right-handedness in cerebellar regions. In contrast, significant associations between footedness and handedness connectivity were observed only in the HCP-A (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05, NBS corrected) and not the HCP-D. No significant associations between eyedness and connectivity were observed for either group. Finally, we compared the effect size between brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations. A greater difference was found in the HCP-D. The two cohorts primarily differed in edge distribution in the prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum. Overall, in adults, brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations were similar. However, in children to adolescents, brain&ndash;handedness and brain&ndash;footedness associations diverge, suggesting a developmental shift. Characterizing sidedness associations with whole-brain connectomes may provide important insights into understanding the motor and visual systems, rehabilitation and occupational therapy, and benchmarking normative variations in the connectome.</p>

                Background Phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, glycosides and volatile oils are only a few bioactive phytochemicals found in most plants including Catha edulis Forsk which is consumed daily in most regions of Uganda. Objective This study aimed to analyze and quantify the bioactive constituents in lyophilized leaf extract of Catha edulis (‘Kasenge’ variety) from central Uganda. Methods Total alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic and saponins contents were determined using spectrophotometric techniques. The bioactive compounds in the Catha edulis leaves were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Result The total alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids and saponins contents were 0.0063 mg/g atropine equivalent, 0.099 mg/g gallic acid equivalent, 0.047 mg/g quercetin equivalent and saponins 0.69 mg/g diosgenin equivalent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting detected thirty-four characteristic phytochemical peaks while gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified twenty-one bioactive compounds including essential fatty acids and diterpenoids known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties with 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester (Z, Z, Z) constituting 35.01%, hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester and methyl ester accounting for over 21% of the composition, phytol (10.38%), butyl 9,12-octadecadienoate (7.58%) and 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol (3.22%). Conclusion Although the alkaloid content in the Kasenge khat variety was lower than that reported in khat from other regions, the phenolic and flavonoid concentrations were comparable, suggesting the potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits of this variety. Further research is recommended to explore its pharmacological properties and optimize cultivation practices to enhance the yield of bioactive compound.

                Background Infertility is a global health issue, with male factor infertility contributing to nearly 50% of cases. Dysregulation of Protein Kinase B (PKB/AKT1) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling impairs spermatogenesis. Bioactive compounds offer promising alternatives for targeting these pathways. Brassica oleracea var. viridis (collard greens) contains phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting potential reproductive benefits. Objective This study evaluates bioactive compounds from B. oleracea var. viridis as AKT1 and EGFR inhibitors through molecular docking and in vivo validation in a cimetidine (Cemet ®)-induced reproductive toxicity model. Methods Bioactive compounds were identified via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and analyzed for physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties. Molecular docking assessed binding affinity to AKT1 and EGFR, followed by in vivo validation in cimetidine-exposed Wistar rats. Effects of ethanol extracts and solvent fractions on sperm motility, viability, morphology, count, and agglutination were examined. Results Gamma-sitosterol showed the strongest binding affinity to AKT1 (-8.0 kcal/mol) and EGFR (-6.5 kcal/mol), comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Computational analysis indicated high Gastro-intestinal absorption and low toxicity for most compounds. In vivo, B. oleracea extracts significantly improved sperm motility, viability, and count, mitigating cimetidine-induced toxicity. Ethanol Leaf Extract of Brassica Oleracea (ELEBO), AFBO (Aqueous fractions of brassica Oleracea) and BFBO (n- Butanol fractions of brassica Oleracea) fractions had the most pronounced protective effects, reducing sperm abnormalities and agglutination. Conclusion B. oleracea var. viridis bioactive compounds show spermatoprotective effects, likely via AKT1 and EGFR inhibition. These findings support further research into B. oleracea derivatives for male reproductive health applications.

                Choosing a course of study in a Senior High School in Ghana is a major problem for both students and parents due to the limited number of Courses Offered. Irrespective of a student’s career aspiration, the current policies of the Ministry of Education, the Ghana Education Service, and the West Africa Examinations Council is restricted to seven main courses, namely: Agriculture, Business, Technical, Home Economics, Visual Arts, General Arts, and General Science. These courses do not reflect the numerous educational courses and career options of the world of work. Although there are schools that offers specialized programmes but the student numbers are few. Annually, hundreds of thousands of students graduate only to be confronted with another hurdle of choosing a course for further studies different from the course studied earlier, or pursue a career different from the course studied in the Senior High School. To address these challenges, this paper recommends Common Career Selective Programme, as a course of study to represent Core subjects, which consists of 18 selective courses dubbed CCSP-18. The CCSP-18 provides general course descriptions, options for specified courses, elective courses, career options, career requirements, and a list of associated careers. The CCSP-18 concept is designed to offer students variety of course options, that suite individual natural abilities and future career goals, in line with Education-for-All by the year 2030. The CCSP-18 policy brief provides policy outcomes and implications, plus actionable recommendations for education reform, and curriculum development. To improve learning outcomes for quality and efficiency, and make education relevant and accessible to all pre-tertiary students. In conclusion education reform using CCSP-18 provide options for Core Courses Offered, and career guidance to students, with basic educational knowledge to drive development agenda, and promote quality Education-for-All in Ghana, across the West Africa sub-region, Africa and other countries globally.

                <p>by Lin Wang, Ting Wang, Xiao-Wei Zhang, Xiao-Fen Lin, Jia Li, Jin-Bao Liao, Rui-Wu Wang</p>

Early ecological theory predicts that complex ecological networks are unstable and are unlikely to persist, despite many empirical studies of such complexity in nature. This inconsistency has fascinated ecologists for decades. To resolve the complexity-stability debate, coupling population dynamics and trait dynamics is considered to be an important way to understand the long-term stability of ecological community assemblages. However, we still do not know how eco-evolutionary feedbacks affect the relationship between complexity and stability in ecologically realistic networks with both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. Here, we explored an adaptive network model to evaluate how the evolution of foraging preference to determine the relationship between network complexity (i.e., connectance) and stability (i.e., community persistence at steady state) in mutualist-exploiter-predator communities (MEST). Our theoretical results showed: (i) adaptive foraging of the top predator contributes to the stability of mutualism and intermediate intensity of foraging adaptations can lead to chaotic dynamics in a four-species MEST community; (ii) the complexity-stability relationship may show positive monotonic, negative monotonic, peaked and double-peaked patterns in general MEST communities, while the double-peaked pattern is only obtained when both the adaptation intensity and interspecific competition are high. Furthermore, model predictions may be consistent with both the negative monotonic pattern revealed in freshwater communities and the peaked pattern revealed in marine communities. Finally, we infer that foraging adaptations of the top predator may alter positive or/and negative feedback loops (trait-mediated indirect effects) to affect the stability of general MEST communities. Our adaptive network framework may provide an effective way to address the complexity-stability debate in real ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-196/v2?src=rss">Fostering sustainable business values: The impact of universities on shaping sustainable entrepreneurial intentions in higher education students from developing economies [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the influence of universities, sustainable business values, and key antecedents of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students in Indian higher education institutions. Employing a cross-sectional design, data were gathered through a structured questionnaire administered to students enrolled in entrepreneurship education programs. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore path relationships and test the hypothesized model. The findings indicate that entrepreneurial attitudes, subjective norms, and sustainable business values significantly predict students’ sustainable entrepreneurial intentions. The study underscores the pivotal role of entrepreneurship education in shaping students’ experiential learning, entrepreneurial attitudes, and sustainable orientation. These insights emphasize the need for integrating comprehensive, sustainability-focused content into entrepreneurship curricula to equip future entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges. The practical implications of this research are twofold. First, it provides universities and policymakers with actionable insights to design and implement more effective and sustainability-centered entrepreneurship programs. Second, by fostering sustainable entrepreneurial mindsets, the study contributes to the promotion of responsible business practices and the stimulation of new venture creation, thereby supporting broader economic development goals in emerging economies. This research highlights that embedding sustainability in entrepreneurship education is not only timely but also essential for nurturing socially responsible and innovation-driven entrepreneurs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-678/v1?src=rss">The Theory of Observational Relativity Serial Report 1: A New Theory with Significant Discoveries [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Einstein’s theory of relativity has been around for over 100 years. However, we still cannot understand why the speed of light is invariant, why spacetime is curved, and why photons have no rest mass. Methods Based on the dialectical materialist view of nature, the author believes that photons, like other particles of matter, should have the rest mass of their own. Therefore, the author sets up an axiom system based on the first principle of time definition, attempting to deduce a new spacetime transformation, and further, derive the mass-speed relation that can endow photons with rest mass. Results Unexpectedly, the author’s logical deduction led to the formation and establishment of a new theory in physics: Observational Relativity (OR). The theory of OR has uncovered the root and essence of the relativistic effects of matter motion and matter interactions presented in spacetime: all relativistic effects are observational effects and apparent phenomena -- the speed of light is not really invariant; spacetime is not really curved; and the rest mass of photons is not really zero. Conclusions The theory of OR discovers that the Galilean transformation and Newtonian mechanics are the product of the idealized observation agent OA∞; the Lorentz transformation and Einstein relativity theory are the product of the optical observation agent OA(c). The theory of OR is a theory of the general observation agent OA(η) (0<η<∞; η→∞), which has generalized and unified Newtonian mechanics and Einstein relativity theory. This article will report the significant discoveries of OR, and at the same time, clarify that the theory of OR not only is the product of logic and theory, but also has empirical basis and empirical evidences, supported by observations and experiments. So, mankind needs to re-examine his physics and reshape his view of nature.
