              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00219">Real-Time Brain-Computer Interface Control of Walking Exoskeleton with Bilateral Sensory Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated the possibility of restoring brain-controlled walking in paraplegic spinal cord injury patients. However, current implementations of BCI-controlled walking still have significant drawbacks. In particular, prior systems are unidirectional and lack sensory feedback for insensate patients, have suboptimal reliance on brain signals from the bilateral arm areas of the motor cortex, and depend on external systems for signal processing. Motivated by these shortcomings, this study is the first time a bidirectional brain-computer interface (BDBCI) has demonstrated the restoration of both brain-controlled walking and leg sensory feedback while utilizing the bilateral leg motor and sensory cortices. Here, a subject undergoing subdural electrocorticogram electrode implantation for epilepsy surgery evaluation leveraged the leg representation areas of the bilateral interhemispheric primary motor and sensory cortices to operate a BDBCI with high performance. Although electrode implantation in the interhemispheric region is uncommon, electrodes can be safely implanted in this region to access rich leg motor information and deliver bilateral leg sensory feedback. Finally, we demonstrated that all BDBCI operations can be executed on a dedicated, portable embedded system. These results indicate that BDBCIs can potentially provide brain-controlled ambulation and artificial leg sensation to people with paraplegia after spinal cord injury in a manner that emulates full-implantability and is untethered from any external systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00196">Mapping minds not averages: a scalable subject-specific manifold learning framework for neuroimaging data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00572">A Bioinformatic Study of Genetics Involved in Determining Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Severity and Recovery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aim: This in silico study sought to identify specific biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) through the analysis of publicly available gene and miRNA databases, hypothesizing their influence on neuronal structure, axonal integrity, and regeneration. Methods: This study implemented a three-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and MalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved performing functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes using Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and predicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3) RNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven candidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B, GFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment analysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic plasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p, has-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664 differentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes at the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively correlated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific genes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes. Our research may guide future mTBI diagnostics, emphasizing the need to measure and track these specific genes and miRNAs in diverse cohorts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05837">Geometrical Structure of Bifurcations during Spatial Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2307.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals must constantly make decisions on the move, such as when choosing among multiple options, or "targets", in space. Recent evidence suggests that this results from a recursive feedback between the (vectorial) neural representation of the targets and the resulting motion defined by this consensus, which then changes the egocentric neural representation of the the options, and so on. Here we employ a simple model of this process to both explore how its dynamics account for the experimentally-observed abruptly-branching trajectories exhibited by animals during spatial decision-making, and to provide new insights into spatiotemporal computation. Essential neural dynamics, notably local excitation and long-range inhibition, are captured in our model via spin-system dynamics, with groups of Ising-spins representing neural "activity bumps" corresponding to target directions. Analysis, employing a novel "mean-field trajectory" approach, reveals the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking - bifurcations in the model that result in literal bifurcations in trajectory space and how it results in new geometric principles for spatiotemporal decision-making. We find that all bifurcation points, beyond the very first, fall on a small number of "bifurcation curves". It is the spatial organization of these curves that is shown to be key to determining the shape of the trajectories, such as self-similar or space filling, exhibited during decision-making, irrespective of the trajectory's starting point. Furthermore, we find that a non-Euclidean representation of space considerably reduces the number of bifurcation points in many geometrical configurations, preventing endless indecision and promoting effective spatial decision-making. This suggests that a non-Euclidean neural representation of space may be expected to have evolved across species in order to facilitate spatial decision-making.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00186">Neuroevolution of Self-Attention Over Proto-Objects</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00251">Multi-start Optimization Method via Scalarization based on Target Point-based Tchebycheff Distance for Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is crucial in scientific and industrial applications where solutions must balance trade-offs among conflicting objectives. State-of-the-art methods, such as NSGA-III and MOEA/D, can handle many objectives but struggle with coverage issues, particularly in cases involving inverted triangular Pareto fronts or strong nonlinearity. Moreover, NSGA-III often relies on simulated binary crossover, which deteriorates in problems with variable dependencies. In this study, we propose a novel multi-start optimization method that addresses these challenges. Our approach introduces a newly introduced scalarization technique, the Target Point-based Tchebycheff Distance (TPTD) method, which significantly improves coverage on problems with inverted triangular Pareto fronts. For efficient multi-start optimization, TPTD leverages a target point defined in the objective space, which plays a critical role in shaping the scalarized function. The position of the target point is adaptively determined according to the shape of the Pareto front, ensuring improvement in coverage. Furthermore, the flexibility of this scalarization allows seamless integration with powerful single-objective optimization methods, such as natural evolution strategies, to efficiently handle variable dependencies. Experimental results on benchmark problems, including those with inverted triangular Pareto fronts, demonstrate that our method outperforms NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D-DE in terms of the Hypervolume indicator. Notably, our approach achieves computational efficiency improvements of up to 474 times over these baselines.

                arXiv:2505.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chance constrained travelling thief problem (chance constrained TTP) has been introduced as a stochastic variation of the classical travelling thief problem (TTP) in an attempt to embody the effect of uncertainty in the problem definition. In this work, we characterise the chance constrained TTP using a limited number of weighted scenarios. Each scenario represents a similar TTP instance, differing slightly in the weight profile of the items and associated with a certain probability of occurrence. Collectively, the weighted scenarios represent a relaxed form of a stochastic TTP instance where the objective is to maximise the expected benefit while satisfying the knapsack constraint with a larger probability. We incorporate a set of evolutionary algorithms and heuristic procedures developed for the classical TTP, and formulate adaptations that apply to the weighted scenario-based representation of the problem. The analysis focuses on the performance of the algorithms on different settings and examines the impact of uncertainty on the quality of the solutions.

                arXiv:2504.21707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning with significant implications for resource constrained applications.

                arXiv:2505.00359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge of storing k-nearest neighbors.

                arXiv:2502.11141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has suggested that the brain is more shallow than previously thought, challenging the traditionally assumed hierarchical structure of the ventral visual pathway. Here, we demonstrate that optimizing convolutional network architectures for brain-alignment via evolutionary neural architecture search results in models with clear representational hierarchies. Despite having random weights, the identified models achieve brain-alignment scores surpassing even those of pretrained classification models - as measured by both regression and representational similarity analysis. Furthermore, through traditional supervised training, architectures optimized for alignment with late ventral regions become competitive classification models. These findings suggest that hierarchical structure is a fundamental mechanism of primate visual processing. Finally, this work demonstrates the potential of neural architecture search as a framework for computational cognitive neuroscience research that could reduce the field's reliance on manually designed convolutional networks.

                arXiv:2504.07453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the challenges of limited Battery Swap Stations datasets, high operational costs, and fluctuating user charging demand, this research proposes a probability estimation model based on charging pile data and constructs nine scenario-specific battery swap demand datasets. In addition, this study combines Least Recently Used strategy with Genetic Algorithm and incorporates a guided search mechanism, which effectively enhances the global optimization capability. Thus, a dual-factor decision-making based charging schedule optimization system is constructed. Experimental results show that the constructed datasets exhibit stable trend characteristics, adhering to 24-hour and 168-hour periodicity patterns, with outlier ratios consistently below 3.26%, confirming data validity. Compared to baseline, the improved algorithm achieves better fitness individuals in 80% of test regions under the same iterations. When benchmarked against immediate swap-and-charge strategy, our algorithm achieves a peak cost reduction of 13.96%. Moreover, peak user satisfaction reaches 98.57%, while the average iteration time remains below 0.6 seconds, demonstrating good computational efficiency. The complete datasets and optimization algorithm are open-sourced at https://github.com/qingshufan/GA-EVLRU.

                arXiv:2405.04620v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

                arXiv:2501.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

                arXiv:2504.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching $\beta$=1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

                arXiv:2504.19636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs. For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.

                arXiv:2504.21155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.

Endomembrane breaching is a crucial strategy employed by intracellular pathogens enclosed within vacuoles to access the nutrient-rich cytosol for intracellular replication. While bacteria use various mechanisms to compromise host membranes, the specific processes and factors involved are often unknown. <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, a major human pathogen, accesses the cytosol relying on the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) and secreted effectors. Using in-cell correlative light and electron microscopy, we tracked the sequential steps of <i>Shigella</i> host cell entry. Moreover, we captured the T3SS, which projects a needle from the bacterial surface, in the process of puncturing holes in the vacuolar membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1269/v2?src=rss">Prevalence and risk factors of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Thammasat University Hospital [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 94.26%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least five days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

                Background Xylene, a common solvent in painting, printing, and shoemaking, enters the body through inhalation of vapors. Methods This observational analytic study, conducted in 2019, aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. Participants were between 16 and 65 years old, provided informed consent, had no history of medically diagnosed liver disease, and submitted complete and accurate questionnaire responses. Confounding factors (physical activity, nutrition, smoking) were controlled through participant questionnaires and statistical adjustments. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-472/v1?src=rss">Assessing the effects of fluids and antibiotics in an acute murine model of sepsis: study protocol for the National Preclinical Sepsis Platform-01 (NPSP-01) Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

                Costa-Pereira et al. uncover a key role for regulatory T (Treg) cells in suppressing GM-CSF-producing T helper (TH) cells via IL-2 modulation, thereby preventing fatal immunopathology. Their study highlights how GM-CSF orchestrates phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction in the absence of Treg cells.

                Higaki et al. provided direct evidence that universal fibroblasts from the lung, the colon, and muscle differentiated into functional HSC niche cells, known as BM CAR cells. This is the first demonstration of the ability of universal fibroblasts to generate tissue-specific specialized fibroblasts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101629">GPRC6A as a novel kokumi receptor responsible for enhanced taste preferences by ornithine</a></h4>

              
                The concept of ‘kokumi’, which refers to an enhanced and more delicious flavor of food, has recently generated considerable interest in food science. However, kokumi has not been well studied in gustatory physiology, and the underlying neuroscientific mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Our previous research demonstrated that ornithine (L-ornithine), which is abundant in shijimi clams, enhanced taste preferences in mice. The present study aimed to build on these findings and investigate the mechanisms responsible for kokumi in rats. In two-bottle preference tests, the addition of ornithine, at a low concentration that did not increase the favorability of this substance alone, enhanced the animals’ preferences for umami, sweet, fatty, salty, and bitter solutions, with the intake of monosodium glutamate showing the most significant increase. Additionally, a mixture of umami and ornithine synergistically induced significant responses in the chorda tympani nerve, which transmits taste information to the brain from the anterior part of the tongue. The observed preference enhancement and increase in taste-nerve response were abolished by antagonists of the G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that GPRC6A was expressed in a subset of type II taste cells in rat fungiform papillae. These results provide new insights into flavor-enhancement mechanisms, confirming that ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a novel kokumi receptor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107067">ATP-release pannexin channels are gated by lysophospholipids</a></h4>

              
                In addition to its role as cellular energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) serves as an extracellular messenger that mediates diverse cell-to-cell communication. Compelling evidence supports that ATP is released from cells through pannexins, a family of membrane proteins that form heptameric large-pore channels. However, the activation mechanisms that trigger ATP release by pannexins remain poorly understood. Here, we discover lysophospholipids as endogenous pannexin activators, using activity-guided fractionation of mouse tissue extracts combined with untargeted metabolomics and electrophysiology. We show that lysophospholipids directly and reversibly activate pannexins in the absence of other proteins. Secretomics experiments reveal that lysophospholipid-activated pannexin 1 leads to the release of not only ATP but also other signaling metabolites, such as 5’-methylthioadenosine, which is important for immunomodulation. We also demonstrate that lysophospholipids activate endogenous pannexin 1 in human monocytes, leading to the release of IL-1β through inflammasome activation. Our results provide a connection between lipid metabolism and purinergic signaling, both of which play major roles in immune responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98001">Physiological magnetic field strengths help magnetotactic bacteria navigate in simulated sediments</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial motility is typically studied in bulk solution, while their natural habitats often are complex environments. Here, we produced microfluidic channels that contained sediment-mimicking obstacles to study swimming of magnetotactic bacteria in a near-realistic environment. Magnetotactic bacteria are microorganisms that form chains of nanomagnets and that orient in Earth’s magnetic field. The obstacles were produced based on micro-computer tomography reconstructions of bacteria-rich sediment samples. We characterized the swimming of the cells through these channels and found that swimming throughput was highest for physiological magnetic fields. This observation was confirmed by extensive computer simulations using an active Brownian particle model. The simulations indicate that swimming at strong fields is impeded by the trapping of bacteria in ‘corners’ that require transient swimming against the magnetic field for escape. At weak fields, the direction of swimming is almost random, making the process inefficient as well. We confirmed the trapping effect in our experiments and showed that lowering the field strength allows the bacteria to escape. We hypothesize that over the course of evolution, magnetotactic bacteria have thus evolved to produce magnetic properties that are adapted to the geomagnetic field in order to balance movement and orientation in such crowded environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97900">Perceptual and attentional impairments of conscious access involve distinct neural mechanisms despite equal task performance</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates failures in conscious access resulting from either weak sensory input (perceptual impairments) or unattended input (attentional impairments). Participants viewed a Kanizsa stimulus with or without an illusory triangle within a rapid serial visual presentation of distractor stimuli. We designed a novel Kanizsa stimulus that contained additional ancillary features of different complexity (local contrast and collinearity) that were independently manipulated. Perceptual performance on the Kanizsa stimulus (presence vs. absence of an illusion) was equated between the perceptual (masking) and attentional (attentional blink) manipulation to circumvent common confounds related to conditional differences in task performance. We trained and tested classifiers on electroencephalogram (EEG) data to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features, with increasing levels of complexity. We show that late stages of processing (~200–250 ms), reflecting the integration of complex stimulus features (collinearity, illusory triangle), were impaired by masking but spared by the attentional blink. In contrast, decoding of local contrast (the spatial arrangement of stimulus features) was observed early in time (~80 ms) and was left largely unaffected by either manipulation. These results replicate previous work showing that feedforward processing is largely preserved under both perceptual and attentional impairments. Crucially, however, under matched levels of performance, only attentional impairments left the processing of more complex visual features relatively intact, likely related to spared lateral and local feedback processes during inattention. These findings reveal distinct neural mechanisms associated with perceptual and attentional impairments and thus contribute to a comprehensive understanding of distinct neural stages leading to conscious access.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104121">Complex system modeling reveals oxalate homeostasis is driven by diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have made clear that host-associated microbiomes touch all facets of health. However, effective therapies that target the microbiome have been elusive given its inherent complexity. Here, we experimentally examined diet-microbe-host interactions through a complex systems framework, centered on dietary oxalate. Using multiple, independent molecular, rodent, and in vitro experimental models, we found that microbiome composition influenced multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces. Importantly, the administration of the oxalate-degrading specialist, <i>Oxalobacter formigenes,</i> was only effective against a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota background and gives critical new insights into why clinical intervention trials with this species exhibit variable outcomes. Data suggest that, while heterogeneity in the microbiome impacts multiple diet-host-microbe interfaces, metabolic redundancy among diverse microorganisms in specific diet-microbe axes is a critical variable that may impact the efficacy of bacteriotherapies, which can help guide patient and probiotic selection criteria in probiotic clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103247">The first complete 3D reconstruction and morphofunctional mapping of an insect eye</a></h4>

              
                The structure of compound eyes in arthropods has been the subject of many studies, revealing important biological principles. Until recently, these studies were constrained by the two-dimensional nature of available ultrastructural data. By taking advantage of the novel three-dimensional ultrastructural dataset obtained using volume electron microscopy, we present the first cellular-level reconstruction of the whole compound eye of an insect, the miniaturized parasitoid wasp <i>Megaphragma viggianii</i>. The compound eye of the female <i>M. viggianii</i> consists of 29 ommatidia and contains 478 cells. Despite the almost anucleate brain, all cells of the compound eye contain nuclei. As in larger insects, the dorsal rim area of the eye in <i>M. viggianii</i> contains ommatidia that are believed to be specialized in polarized light detection as reflected in their corneal and retinal morphology. We report the presence of three ‘ectopic’ photoreceptors. Our results offer new insights into the miniaturization of compound eyes and scaling of sensory organs in general.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100788">Seasonal and comparative evidence of adaptive gene expression in mammalian brain size plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Contrasting almost all other mammalian wintering strategies, Eurasian common shrews, <i>Sorex araneus</i>, endure winter by shrinking their brain, skull, and most organs, only to then regrow to breeding size the following spring. How such tiny mammals achieve this unique brain size plasticity while maintaining activity through the winter remains unknown. To discover potential adaptations underlying this trait, we analyzed seasonal differential gene expression in the shrew hypothalamus, a brain region that both regulates metabolic homeostasis and drastically changes size, and compared hypothalamus gene expression across species. We discovered seasonal variation in suites of genes involved in energy homeostasis and apoptosis, shrew-specific upregulation of genes involved in the development of the hypothalamic blood-brain barrier and calcium signaling, as well as overlapping seasonal and comparative gene expression divergence in genes implicated in the development and progression of human neurological and metabolic disorders, including <i>CCDC22</i>. With high metabolic rates and facing harsh winter conditions, <i>S. araneus</i> have evolved both adaptive and plastic mechanisms to sense and regulate their energy budget. Many of these changes mirrored those identified in human neurological and metabolic disease, highlighting the interactions between metabolic homeostasis, brain size plasticity, and longevity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100064">Neural geometry from mixed sensorimotor selectivity for predictive sensorimotor control</a></h4>

              
                Although recent studies suggest that activity in the motor cortex, in addition to generating motor outputs, receives substantial information regarding sensory inputs, it is still unclear how sensory context adjusts the motor commands. Here, we recorded population neural activity in the motor cortex via microelectrode arrays while monkeys performed flexible manual interceptions of moving targets. During this task, which requires predictive sensorimotor control, the activity of most neurons in the motor cortex encoding upcoming movements was influenced by ongoing target motion. Single-trial neural states at the movement onset formed staggered orbital geometries, suggesting that target motion modulates peri-movement activity in an orthogonal manner. This neural geometry was further evaluated with a representational model and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with task-specific input-output mapping. We propose that the sensorimotor dynamics can be derived from neuronal mixed sensorimotor selectivity and dynamic interaction between modulations.

">Daily light exposure habits of youth with migraine: A prospective pilot study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Eighty percent of youth with migraine report photophobia. It is unknown if photophobia leads to light avoidant behavior, and if such behaviors worsen light sensitivity and disrupt sleep. Recently developed wearable, continuous light loggers allow us to address these open questions. We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of measuring light exposure using wearable light loggers in youth with migraine. Methods: Youth 10 to 21 years old with a headache-specialist confirmed ICHD-3 diagnosis of migraine were recruited from CHOP headache clinics. Each participant recorded 7 consecutive days of light logging data from the ActLumus device worn as a pendant around the neck paired with a text-based daily migraine symptom diary during a typical school week between November and March 2024. Validated questionnaires were used to capture headache and migraine frequency, headache-related disability, visual sensitivity, fear-of-pain, and sleep disturbance and impairment. Percent time spent within recommended light exposure levels was calculated for the day, 3 hours prior to bedtime, and night. Power analysis was calculated to determine sample size needed for group comparison of baseline characteristics across light intensity and light timing metrics to aid in the design of larger studies. Results: Twenty youth with a median age 17 years [IQR 16, 19], 70% of whom were female completed 7 days of continuous light logger recording and daily headache diary. Data completion rates were high with 136/140 (97.1%) useable days of light logger data, and 100% compliance on the daily headache diary. Participant feedback on the study was positive; 85% would recommend the study to others. On average, participants received recommended light exposure during only 14.5% +/- SD 7.0 of daylight hours. By contrast, participants were more consistently below the recommended maximum light levels 3 hours prior to bed (77.5% +/- 21.6 of the time), and at night (99.1% +/- 2.9 of the time). Youth with chronic migraine (i.e., at least 15 headache days and 8 migraine days per month) had daily light exposure patterns that were phase shifted 60 minutes later as compared to participants with non-chronic migraine. Power analyses suggest that future tests for differences in light exposure between migraine-characteristic groups (e.g., differing by headache frequency, severity, or disability) will require sample sizes on the order of 50 to 150 to reach 80% power with an alpha of 0.05. Conclusion: Measuring daily light exposure is feasible in pediatric populations with photophobia and reveals intriguing trends in youth with migraine that warrant further study.

">Mechanical Artifacts During Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Mimic Biologically Evoked Responses</a></h4>

              
                Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) has emerged as a promising modality for non-invasive neuromodulation, offering deep brain penetration and high spatial precision. However, the electrophysiological effects of tFUS remain poorly understood, in part due to challenges distinguishing genuine neural responses from mechanical artifacts. In this study, we investigated the electrophysiological signatures captured during tFUS of the anesthetized rat hippocampus using silicon microelectrodes. We observed a strong, stereotyped local field potential (LFP) response that was time-locked to the onset and offset of sonication and resembled sensory-evoked potentials. Critically, the same waveform was observed in euthanized animals, confirming a non-biological, artifact-driven origin. The artifact scaled with acoustic intensity and was most pronounced under continuous-wave sonication. These findings suggest that electrode movement induced by ultrasound can generate artifactual LFP signals that closely mimic authentic neural responses. Our results underscore the need for caution when interpreting in situ electrophysiological recordings during tFUS and advocate for alternative, artifact-resistant readouts such as fiber photometry to unambiguously detect neuromodulatory effects.

">Plasma pTau-217 Correlates with Brain Atrophy, Cognition, and CSF Biomarkers in a Cognitively Healthy Community Cohort</a></h4>

              
                Plasma biomarkers are promising for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but their role in cognitively healthy individuals remains unclear. Plasma pTau-217 has high diagnostic accuracy for clinical and prodromal AD, yet its relevance in preclinical stages is underexplored. We examined if plasma biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation were associated with cognition, brain structure, and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) counterparts in dementia-free older adults. We studied community-based, dementia-free older adults from the Brain and Cognitive Health (BACH) cohort. Neuropsychological testing assessed global cognition (MMSE), memory (Logical Memory II), visual processing (Hooper Visual Organization Test), processing speed (Trail Making Test-A), and reasoning (Similarities). Paired plasma and CSF biomarkers (pTau-217, pTau-181, GFAP, NfL, A{beta}42/40) were measured using SIMOA. MRI-derived cortical thickness was used as a neurodegeneration marker. Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between log10-transformed plasma biomarker levels, cognition (adjusted for age, sex, education, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes), and cortical thickness (adjusted for age, sex, education, and intracranial volume). Pearson's correlations and Bland-Altman plots evaluated plasma-CSF agreement. There were 147 dementia-free participants (mean age{+/-}SD: 66.7{+/-}7.7 years; 56 % women). Higher plasma pTau-217 levels associated with lower global cognition scores ({beta} -0.80, 95% C.I. -1.56, -0.03, p=0.041) and abstract reasoning ({beta} -0.86, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] -1.62, -0.09, p=0.028). Greater plasma pTau-217 also associated with lower global cortical thickness ({beta}eta [{beta}] -0.21, 95% confidence interval [C.I]. -0.37, -0.06, per log unit change; p=0.006). No associations were found between the plasma biomarkers and processing speed or visual processing (p>0.05 for all). Among 47 participants with paired plasma-CSF biomarkers, plasma pTau-217 showed the strongest correlation with its CSF counterpart (R=0.76, p<0.0001), outperforming pTau-181 (R=0.61, p<0.0001), GFAP (R=0.66, p<0.0001), NfL (R=0.56, p<0.0001), and A{beta}42/40 (R=0.53, p=0.0001). In conclusion, plasma pTau-217 levels were associated with both cognition and cortical thickness in dementia-free older adults. All plasma biomarkers correlated significantly with their CSF counterpart. These findings reinforce the utility of plasma biomarkers, particularly pTau-217, as indicators of neurodegenerative processes, even in asymptomatic individuals.

                The China Brain Multi-omics Atlas Project (CBMAP) aims to generate a comprehensive molecular reference map of over 1,000 human brains (Phase I), spanning a broad age range and multiple regions in China, to address the underrepresentation of East Asian populations in brain research. By integrating genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome (including multiple post-translational modifications), and metabolome data, CBMAP is set to provide a rich and invaluable resource for investigating the molecular underpinnings of aging-related brain phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders. Leveraging high-throughput omics data and advanced technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-nucleus 3D chromatin structure analysis, this atlas will serve as a crucial resource for the brain science community, illuminating disease mechanisms and enhancing the utility of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). CBMAP is also poised to accelerate drug discovery and precision medicine for brain disorders.

">EEG Functional Connectivity as a Marker of Evolution from Infantile Epileptic Spasms Syndrome to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Timely diagnosis and effective treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) improve prognosis and lower healthcare costs, but the transition from infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) to LGS is highly variable and insidious. Objective biomarkers are needed to monitor this progression and guide clinical decision making. We retrospectively collected longitudinal EEG data at the Children's Hospital of Orange County from fifteen children who were diagnosed with IESS and later with LGS between 2012 and 2021. EEGs were from IESS and LGS diagnoses, between the two diagnoses, and following LGS diagnosis. Functional connectivity networks were calculated using a cross-correlation-based method and assessed relative to diagnostic timepoint, treatment response, presence of clinical markers of disease, age, and amplitude of interictal spikes. Connectivity strength was high at LGS diagnosis and decreased after favorable response to treatment, but it remained stable or increased when response was unfavorable. In all subjects, connectivity strength was higher at the time of LGS diagnosis than at the preceding timepoint. Presence of clinical markers of LGS were associated with high connectivity strength, but no single marker predicted connectivity strength. Computational EEG analysis can be used to map the evolution from IESS to LGS. Changes in connectivity may enable prediction of impending LGS and treatment response monitoring, thus facilitating earlier LGS treatment and guiding medical management.

">Behaviors resulting from the activation of single olfactory receptor neuron class depends on multiple second-order neuron types</a></h4>

              
                Animals rely on olfactory cues to guide critical behaviors such as foraging, mate selection, and predator avoidance. Animals discriminate between different odors because each odor binds to a distinct set of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). The relationship between the activated ORN class and resulting behavior is an intensely studied problem. Genetic tools in the Drosophila olfactory system make it particularly suitable for understanding this relationship. In this study, we investigate how activity in Or7a-expressing ORNs (Or7a-ORNs) which projects to the DL5 glomerulus, is transformed into aversive behavior. We find that optogenetically activating Or7a-ORNs causes an increase in locomotion speed which results in mild aversion. Surprisingly, silencing the synaptically connected second-order neuron called DL5PN increases the aversion. Silencing DL5PN has no effect on the increase in speed. The increased aversion results from the flies returning to the stimulated area less often. When DL5PN is left intact, flies return more frequently to the stimulated area. Patch-clamp recordings from PNs other than DL5PNs suggest they are activated when Or7a-ORNs are activated. These results suggest that the behavioral effect downstream of a given ORN class is mediated by multiple PN classes. This work advances our understanding of how aversion is encoded and transmitted through early sensory circuits to shape behavior.

">A simple, inexpensive battery-powered homeothermic warming pad for mice and rats</a></h4>

              
                Background Anesthesia decreases core body temperature, and this seriously compromises the physiological status of an experimental animal. Hypothermia alters many aspects of neural function. When recording nervous system activity in anesthetized animals, their core temperature must be stabilized. New method This report describes an inexpensive, battery-powered, temperature-controlled warming pad for mice and rats and documents its validity and utility. The device is portable, making it convenient for researchers who conduct procedures such as surgical preparations in one location and transport the anesthetized animal to another location for experimental recordings. Results The device keeps anesthetized mice normothermic +/- 0.7 C. for over 6 hours without supplemental warmth (e.g., heat lamp), despite >15 C. differential between ambient room temperature and core body temperature. We demonstrate how the warming pad can be used for in vivo imaging of neuronal activity for a prolonged period in mice. Comparison with existing methods Commercial heating pads for small animals are expensive, somewhat bulky, and require power cords and a 120/240V source. Transporting an anesthetized animal from one location (e.g. surgical suite) to another (e.g., imaging rig) involves moving power cords. Moreover, commercial devices are not always compatible with custom stereotaxic frames, microscope stages, or holding boxes. The device described here is small, inexpensive, battery-powered, and readily adaptable to experimental set ups. Conclusion The homeothermic heating pad provides a simple method for maintaining the core temperature of anesthetized small animals. It can be constructed in under 30 minutes, the components are readily available, and the cost is less than $100. It is exceptionally useful for experiments on mice or rats.

">Neural correlates of appetitive extinction learning: An fMRI study with actively participating pigeons</a></h4>

              
                Extinction learning is an important learning process that enables adaptive and flexible behavior. Human neuroimaging studies show that the neural basis of extinction learning consists of a neural network that includes the hippocampus, amygdala, and subcomponents of the prefrontal cortex, but also extends beyond them. The limitations of applying fMRI to actively participating animals have so far restricted the identification of the entire extinction network in non-human animals. Here, we present the first fMRI study of extinction in awake and actively participating pigeons, using a Go/NoGo operant paradigm with a water reward. Our study revealed an extensive and largely left hemispheric telencephalic network of sensory, limbic, executive, and motor areas that slowly ceased to be active during the process of extinction learning. We propose that the onset of extinction ignites a neuronal updating of the associated consequences of own actions within a large telencephalic neural network until a new association is established which inhibits the previously acquired operant response.

">Interaction between Model-based and Model-free Mechanisms in Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning can be driven by distinct mechanisms - habitual, model-free processes, and strategic, model-based processes-depending on the magnitude and context of movement errors. Although small and large errors are known to engage distinct motor learning mechanisms - model-free (implicit) or model-based (explicit), respectively - it remains unclear whether successfully deploying one mechanism might hamper the engagement of the other in subsequent learning tasks. Here, we investigated how prior engagement of a particular mechanism biases future adaptations, even when the new task context typically favours the alternative strategy. Across three experiments (N=82), participants performed reaching movements to targets that either remained fixed or jumped mid-movement by small (15{degrees}) or large (30{degrees}, 45{degrees}, or 60{degrees}) angles. When first exposed to small errors (15{degrees}), participants exhibited persistent aftereffects in subsequent catch trials and stable reaction times (RTs), hallmarks of a model-free, habitual process. Surprisingly, even when switching to larger error magnitudes later, these participants continued to show robust aftereffects and did not elevate RTs - indicating a carryover of model-free learning. Conversely, participants who initially experienced large errors showed minimal aftereffects and flexible RT modulation consistent with model-based strategies; this bias persisted in later sessions with smaller errors, leading to reduced habitual aftereffects. Notably, inserting a washout phase to reset baseline performance did not abolish these mechanistic biases, highlighting that the initial engagement of either model-free or model-based processes leaves a durable imprint on subsequent adaptations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that motor learning is shaped not only by ongoing task demands (e.g., error magnitude) but also by an individual's prior learning history. Understanding how initial learning experiences constrain future adaptations has broad implications for designing interventions and training protocols in motor rehabilitation and skill acquisition.

">Changing cognitive chimera states in human brain networks with age: Variations in cognitive integration and segregation</a></h4>

              
                The aging process profoundly impacts the human brain, leading to notable changes in cognitive abilities. Although the brains structural and functional alterations with age are individually well documented, how differences in cognitive abilities emerge from variations in the underlying spatio-temporal patterns of regional brain activity is largely unknown. Patterns of increased synchronization between brain regions are taken as enhanced cognitive integration, while decreased synchronization is indicative of cognitive segregation. The ability to dynamically switch between different levels of integration and segregation across different cognitive systems is believed to be crucial for overall cognitive performance. Building on a recently proposed cognitively informed, synchronization-based framework, we study here age-related variations in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization or chimera states. Leveraging personalized brain network models based on large-scale, multisite datasets of cross-sectional healthy cohorts, we systematically show how regional brain stimulation produces distinct patterns of synchronization. We find that chimera states play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cognitive integration and segregation as the brain ages, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. Whereas the emergent synchronization behavior of brain regions belonging to the same cognitive system often show the same aging trends, different cognitive systems can demonstrate distinct trends. This supports the idea that aging affects cognitive systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging. At the same time, dynamical flexibility increases in the oldest age groups across most cognitive systems. This may reflect compensatory mechanisms to counteract age-related cognitive declines and points towards a phenomenon of dedifferentiation. Yet, the multiplicity of behaviors highlights that whereas dedifferentiation emerges in certain cognitive systems, differentiation can also occur in others. This illustrates that these processes, though seemingly oppositional, can coexist and unfold in parallel across different cognitive systems.

">Repeated blood-brain barrier opening using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound mitigates amyloid pathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: The delivery of large molecules to the pathological brain is one of the main obstacles in the development of disease-modifying drugs. This is partly due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which blocks the free passage of lipophobic molecules and those larger than 400 Da. One strategy to bypass this natural barrier is to use low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) to oscillate circulating micro-sized microbubbles which then exert mechanical stress on the vessel walls. This procedure allows for temporary disruption of the BBB and enhanced local delivery of therapeutics from the blood to the brain parenchyma. In this study, the effect of repeated BBB opening on neuroinflammation in a healthy mouse model was first explored followed by the effect of repeated opening on amyloid pathology in a model for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: A cohort of wildtype mice was used to determine the effect of a single BBB opening mediated by ultrasound/microbubbles (US/MB) on the inflammatory profile, using RT-Q-PCR on brain extracts at 2-, 4-, 8- and 15-days post opening. A second cohort of ARTE10 mice, a mouse model for amyloid pathology, was treated with a different sequence of repeated US/MB mediated BBB opening to explore the effect on the pathology. Tissues were also analyzed for immune cell infiltration, microglia and astrocyte activation, and inflammatory response. Results: Our results demonstrate that the opening of the BBB leads to a mild inflammatory response in wild-type animals. However, repeated opening of the BBB in the ARTE10 model resulted in a decrease in amyloid pathology, along with a mild increase of growth factor. Conclusions: Altogether, this study suggests that sonication is not only a safe method to deliver therapeutics to the brain but could also have synergistic effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

">Is the whole the sum of its parts? Neural computation of consumer bundle valuation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Humans are often tasked with making decisions about bundles of multiple items and very little is known about how the human brain aggregates, computes and represents value in such cases. We investigated how the human brain evaluates consumer items, both individually and in bundles, and how this activity relates to choice behavior. Participants underwent a deep-fMRI scanning protocol while we elicited behavioral valuations for single and bundled items. Behaviorally, we find that bundle values are sub-additively discounted compared to the sum of individual item values. Neurally, we find that the same distributed network in pre-frontal cortex computes the value of a bundle and its constituent individual items, but the value representation undergoes a normalization that actively re-scales across bundle and single item contexts. These findings suggest that generalized value regions contextually adapt within a valuation hierarchy, as opposed to utilizing an absolute value code.

">Attention to a point in time causes a suppressive wake for subsequent time points</a></h4>

              
                The Selective Tuning model proposed that attention to a visual stimulus suppresses interfering portions of the processing hierarchy. This has been shown in spatial and featural domains and the proposal extends to the temporal dimension. We investigated whether attending to a point in time leads to processing suppression of nearby time points. We presented a sequence of letters with an embedded target, and observers indicated the target's orientation. In the neutral condition, the target appeared randomly in one of the frames. In the informative condition, the target appeared in the same frame on most of the trials ('expected' trials), and the expected frame varied between blocks (Experiments 1-3) or groups (Experiment 4). On the remaining trials, it appeared before or after the most-probable frame ('unexpected' trials). Four different experiments were conducted to adjust the method and in the final one we found higher accuracy in expected trials than in neutral trials, indicating the allocation of temporal attention to the expected frame. When the target appeared after the expected frame, accuracy was lower than in the same neutral condition frame, suggesting an attentional suppressive wake in time (because the effect of attention cannot be observed until after stimulus onset).

">Computational modeling-directed combination treatment with etanercept and mifepristone mitigates neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Gulf War Illness.</a></h4>

              
                Gulf War Illness is a chronic multi-symptom disorder experienced by over 30% of veterans from the 1990-1991 Gulf War and is increasingly recognized to be driven by underlying persistent neuroinflammation resulting from chemical and physiological exposures experienced during deployment. Despite significant advances in identifying Gulf War-relevant exposures and underlying pathobiology, effective treatment strategies for Gulf War Illness are still largely lacking. Many studies that have evaluated potential therapies for Gulf War Illness have primarily focused on a single treatment. However, through a mechanistically informed computational evaluation of blood biomarkers and gene expression in veterans with Gulf War Illness, we identified that a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-glucocorticoid treatment may prove effective in treating Gulf War Illness. Here, we have evaluated combined treatment with the anti-TNF drug, etanercept, and anti-glucocorticoid, mifepristone, in an established long-term mouse model of Gulf War Illness of combined physiological stress and nerve agent exposure. Supporting results from the computational modeling of this treatment, we found that this drug combination significantly alleviates the underlying neuroinflammation associated with Gulf War Illness. The fusion of computational and in vivo preclinical treatment evaluation may provide a highly useful and translationally relevant means by which to identify successful treatment paradigms for Gulf War Illness.

">Neurophysiological Markers of Cancer-Related Fatigue Derived from High-Density EEG</a></h4>

              
                Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) significantly diminishes the quality of life of cancer survivors; however, objective diagnostic markers and the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to identify noninvasive EEG-based biomarkers of CRF by examining cortical activity and functional connectivity. We recorded resting-state and task-related [repetitive submaximal elbow flexion (EFs) until self-perceived exhaustion] high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from 10 cancer survivors with CRF and 14 healthy controls (HC). In our analysis, task-induced fatigue was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe, corresponding to the level of fatigue perceived at the beginning, middle, and end of the task period. Our study revealed the following significant findings: (1) Linear mixed-effects modeling of event-related desynchronization (ERD) EEG analysis during the EF task demonstrated significant effects of group and fatigue levels in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). (2) EF task-specific functional connectivity was estimated using the debiased weighted phase-lag index (dwPLI), which demonstrated reduced inter-regional connectivity in the M1 and prefrontal regions in the CRF group compared with the HC group. (3) The dwPLI analysis identified significantly reduced alpha-band connectivity strength in the CRF group, particularly between the right supramarginal gyrus and other brain regions during mild fatigue. (4) Additionally, resting-state EEG exhibited globally elevated delta band (1-4 Hz) activity in CRF survivors than HC, potentially reflecting chronic fatigue. These observations emphasize the clinical relevance of resting-state EEG, motor activity-related ERD and functional brain connectivity as potential CRF biomarkers. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and provide insights into more objective CRF diagnosis and the development of personalized interventions for alleviating CRF.

">Gut transit and gut microbiome changes occur prior to the onset of motor impairment in a mouse model of Machado-Joseph disease</a></h4>

              
                We previously identified microbial shifts prior to the onset of motor and neurological symptoms within a mouse model of the fatal neurodegenerative disease Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Here, we aimed to explore possible mechanisms contributing to these changes within the microbiome-gut-brain axis, and whether it preceded or followed central neurodegeneration. Here, we report that pre-symptomatic male MJD mice present with significantly different microbiome communities as early as 5-weeks-old. Furthermore, we show that male MJD mice have faster total gut transit times by 9-weeks-old, prior to signs of impaired motor function by 11- weeks-old. To elucidate whether these microbial and colonic functional changes are due to the presence of pathological and morphological changes in the gut, we quantified the formation of ataxin-3 protein aggregates within the gut and examined morphological changes within the gut of pre- and early symptomatic MJD mice relative to proteinopathy in the brain. Interestingly, we observed ataxin-3 aggregates within the brains of pre-symptomatic MJD mice, with significantly more aggregates present in MJD than WT mice from 7-weeks-of-age, an earlier timepoint than previously reported, coinciding with changes within the microbiome. However, we observed no ataxin-3 protein aggregates and no changes in enteric neuron populations or morphology within the gut. Analysis of endocrine factors involved in gut motility and inflammatory markers within the small intestine of 13-week-old males revealed increased expression of genes encoding cholecystokinin (Cck), ghrelin (Ghrl), heme oxygenase (Ho1), interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), and decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). Together, we demonstrate for the first time that colonic dysfunction occurs after gut microbiome changes, but prior to the onset of motor impairments in male MJD mice. Our work suggests that whilst proteinopathy or morphological changes within the gut may not be involved in these changes, inflammation and related endocrine changes could have a role in the interplay between the gut and brain during MJD development, warranting further investigation.

">Neurogliaform cells mediate interhemispheric modulation of sensory-evoked activity in cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Integration of bilateral sensory inputs requires effective communication between brain hemispheres. This interhemispheric communication is essential for sensory perception and involves reciprocal connections between homotopic sensory areas. A key role in this process is attributed to interhemispheric inhibition which, owing to its long-lasting form, is posited to operate largely through neurogliaform cells (NGCs). However, direct evidence on the role of NGCs in interhemispheric inhibition is missing. Here we show that NGCs in the mouse barrel cortex (BC) are engaged by interhemispheric callosal projections to modulate pyramidal neuron (PN) activity and sensory perception. Using optogenetics, ex vivo whole-cell recordings, and in vivo calcium imaging, we found that layer 1 and layer 2/3 (L1-3) NGCs are strongly activated by the callosal and suppressed by the thalamocortical pathway, suggesting that NGCs encode ipsilateral rather than contralateral whisker stimuli. We also found that direct stimulation of L1-3 NGCs modulates whisker-evoked activity in L2/3 and L5b PNs, and increases the perceptual threshold in a whisker-deflection detection task. Furthermore, these effects were recapitulated by direct stimulation of callosal projections and deflection of the ipsilateral whiskers respectively, suggesting that the effect of the callosal pathway on sensory perception is mediated by NGCs. Our results not only prove that NGCs mediate interhemispheric inhibition, but also demonstrate their role in sensory perception via modulation of the main units involved in cortical input and output.

">Sleep is associated with reduction of excitatory signaling in medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although many sleep medications enhance inhibitory signaling, it remains unclear whether inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters contribute to the natural transition from wakefulness to sleep in humans. Here, we show that changes in excitatory, rather than inhibitory, neurotransmitter levels are associated with this transition. Young, healthy participants underwent two nap sessions with polysomnography, during which glutamate and GABA concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex were measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Glutamate gradually decreased during deeper sleep stages compared to wakefulness in the second session, with better sleep quality. No such change occurred in the first session with poorer sleep, likely due to the first-night effect. Furthermore, reduced glutamate significantly mediated sleep-onset latency in both sessions. Conversely, GABA concentration did not change from wakefulness to sleep in either session. These findings provide the first evidence that reduced excitatory signaling is a key feature of natural good sleep onset in the human brain.

">Perceptual prediction error supports implicit process in motor learning.</a></h4>

              
                Error-based learning underlies motor learning, but what specific motor error drives implicit learning, the procedural component of motor skill, is unclear. A typical action consists of a movement and a performance outcome, e.g., grabbing a coffee cup involves a reaching movement and its actual landing of the hand relative to the target cup. While performance error is fundamental for the cognitive component of motor learning, what error, either performance or movement prediction error, underlies implicit motor learning has not been resolved. These two errors are hard to disentangle as the performance outcome is an integral part of the movement. Here we used the classical visuomotor adaptation paradigm, in which people learn to counter visual perturbations by deliberately aiming off the target, to dissociate the performance error from the prediction error. Using a series of behavioral experiments and model comparisons, we revealed that movement prediction error, but not performance error, can parsimoniously explain diverse learning effects. Importantly, despite the perturbation is visual, the movement prediction error is not specified in visual terms, but determined by a perceptual estimate of the hand kinematics. In other words, contrary to the widely-held concept of sensory prediction error, a perceptual prediction error drives implicit motor learning.

">In-phase and anti-phase dual-site beta tACS differentially influence functional connectivity and motor inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory control relies on coordinated beta-band activity within a fronto-basal ganglia network, which implements inhibition via downstream effects on (pre)motor areas. In this study, we employed dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and primary motor cortex (M1) to directly manipulate phase relationships in the beta band and assess their effects on both functional connectivity and motor inhibition. Fifty-two healthy participants received in-phase, anti-phase and sham stimulation while performing a stop-signal task. The results revealed that connectivity between rIFG and lM1 increased following in-phase but decreased after anti-phase stimulation. Although no direct modulation of task performance was observed, the greater connectivity increase between the targets during in-phase stimulation was predictive of faster inhibitory performance. In contrast, greater connectivity decreases during anti-phase stimulation were related to faster go responses, suggesting a shift towards less inhibition on the motor system. These findings provide evidence that dual-site beta-tACS can both enhance and impair inhibitory control depending on phase alignment, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive intervention for disorders marked by impaired inhibition.

">HPDL is critical in human cortical development via regulation of mitochondrial functional properties</a></h4>

              
                Human brain development is highly regulated by several spatiotemporal processes, which disruption can result in severe neurological disorders. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of mitochondrial function as one of these fundamental pathways involved in neurodevelopment. Our study investigates the role of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like (HPDL) protein in cortical neurogenesis and mitochondrial activity, since mutations in the HPDL gene are associated with SPG83, a childhood-onset form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by corticospinal tract degeneration and cortical abnormalities. Starting from mutant neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrated that HPDL is essential to mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and cellular redox balance. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulated pathways related to neurogenesis, implicating HPDL role in early cortical development. To further elucidate the role of HPDL, we generated cortical neurons and organoids from SPG83 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant cells exhibited premature neurogenesis at early differentiation stages, likely leading to depletion of cortical progenitors, as evidenced by decreased proliferation, slight increase of apoptosis, and unbalanced cortical type composition at later stages. Furthermore, cortical organoids derived from SPG83 patients showed impaired growth, reminding microcephaly observed in severe cases. In addition, mitochondrial morpho-functional characterization in mutant neurons confirmed disruption of OxPhos chain functionality and increased ROS generation rate. Treatment of cortical cells with two antioxidant compounds, could partially revert premature neurogenesis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a critical role for HPDL in coordinating cortical progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These insights shed light on a mechanistical understanding of SPG83 pathology and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting oxidative stress in this and related neurological disorders.

">Astrocyte-derived PTPRZ1 regulates astrocyte morphology and excitatory synaptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1) is one of the most abundantly expressed and enriched proteins in astrocytes during development, yet its function in astrocytes is unknown. Using an astrocyte-neuron co-culture system, we found that knockdown of Ptprz1 in astrocytes significantly impaired astrocyte branching morphogenesis. To investigate the function of PTPRZ1 in astrocytes during brain development, we generated a Ptprz1 conditional knockout mouse and deleted Ptprz1 from astrocytes postnatally, after the bulk of astrogenesis is complete. At postnatal day 21, we found defects in astrocyte morphology and a reduction in excitatory synapse number across multiple layers of the visual cortex, suggesting important functions for astrocytic PTPRZ1 in both astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis. PTPRZ1 is expressed in several neural cell types, including radial glial stem cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and regulates critical aspects of neurodevelopment, including neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation, myelination, and extracellular matrix (ECM) development. Moreover, altered PTPRZ1 expression is associated with schizophrenia and glioblastoma. Therefore, this mouse model is a valuable resource for investigating cell-type-specific PTPRZ1 function in numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropathological mechanisms.

                Despite their importance for brain function, cortico-subcortical white matter tracts are under-represented in diffusion MRI tractography studies. Their non-invasive mapping is more challenging and less explored compared to other major cortico-cortical bundles. We introduce a set of standardised tractography protocols for delineating tracts between the cortex and various deep subcortical structures, including the caudate, putamen, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus.<br />To enable comparative studies, our protocols are designed for both human and macaque brains. We demonstrate how tractography reconstructions follow topographical principles obtained from tracers in the macaque and how these translate to humans. We show that the proposed protocols are robust against data quality and preserve aspects of individual variability stemming from family structure in humans. Lastly, we demonstrate the value of these species-matched protocols in mapping homologous grey matter regions in humans and macaques, both in cortex and subcortex.

">Presynaptic vesicles supply membrane for axonal bouton enlargement during LTP</a></h4>

              
                Long-term potentiation (LTP) induces presynaptic bouton enlargement and a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles. To understand the relationship between these events, we performed 3D analysis of serial section electron micrographs in rat hippocampal area CA1, 2 hours after LTP induction. We observed a high vesicle packing density in control boutons, contrasting with a lower density in most LTP boutons. Notably, the summed membrane area of the vesicles lost in low-density LTP boutons is comparable to the surface membrane required for the observed bouton enlargement when compared to high-density control boutons. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic vesicle density provides a new structural indicator of LTP that supports a local mechanism of bouton enlargement.

">3D multimodal histological atlas and coordinate framework for the mouse brain and head</a></h4>

              
                Brain reference atlases are essential for neuroscience experiments and data integration. However, histological atlases of the mouse brain, crucial in biomedical research, have not kept pace. Autofluorescence-based volumetric brain atlases are increasingly used but lack microscopic histological contrast, cytoarchitectonic information, corresponding MRI datasets, and often have truncated brainstems. Here, we present a multimodal, multiscale atlas of the laboratory mouse brain and head. The new reference brains include the whole head with consecutive Nissl and myelin serial section histology in three planes of section with 0.46 m in-plane resolution, including intact brainstem, cranial nerves, and associated sensors and musculature. We provide reassembled histological volumes with 20 m isotropic resolution in stereotactic coordinates, determined using co-registered in vivo MRI and CT. In addition to conventional MRI contrasts, we provide diffusion MRI-based in vivo and ex vivo microstructural information, adding a valuable co-registered contrast modality that bridges MRI with cell-resolution histological data. We shift emphasis from compartmental annotations to stereotactic coordinates in the reference brains, offering a basis for evolving annotations over time and resolving conflicting neuroanatomical judgments by different experts. This new reference atlas facilitates integration of molecular cell type data and regional connectivity, serves as a model for similar atlases in other species, and sets a precedent for preserving extra-cranial nervous system structures.

                <p>Layer 5 (L5) of the cortex provides strong driving input to higher-order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar in the visual system, forming the basis of cortico-thalamo-cortical (transthalamic) circuits. These circuits provide a communication route between cortical areas in parallel to direct corticocortical connections, but their specific role in perception and behavior remains unclear. Using targeted optogenetic inhibition in mice of both sexes performing a visual discrimination task, we selectively suppressed the corticothalamic input from L5 cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) at their terminals in the pulvinar. This suppresses transthalamic circuits from V1; furthermore, any effect on direct corticocortical projections and local V1 circuitry would thus result from transthalamic inputs (e.g., V1 to pulvinar back to V1; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Miller-Hansen and Sherman, 2022</cross-ref>). Such suppression of transthalamic processing during visual stimulus presentation of drifting gratings significantly impaired discrimination performance across different orientations. The impact on behavior was specific to the portion of visual space that retinotopically coincided with the V1 L5 corticothalamic inhibition. These results highlight the importance of incorporating L5-initiated transthalamic circuits into cortical processing frameworks, particularly those addressing how the hierarchical propagation of sensory signals supports perceptual decision-making.</p>

                <p>The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is the large white matter association tract connecting the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Past studies in nonhuman primates have parcellated the SLF into three subdivisions and have outlined the specific corticocortical organization and terminations for each subdivision. However, it is difficult to characterize these structural connections in humans to the specificity of tract-tracing studies in animals. This has led to disagreement on how the SLF subdivisions are organized in the human brain, including if the dorsomedial SLF (SLF-I) is part of the cingulum subsystem. Here, we present a novel large-scale, probabilistic map of the SLF subdivisions, using high-resolution diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We used image data from 302 adult males and 405 adult females to model the three SLF subdivisions in each hemisphere and attempted to characterize the frontal and parietal termination points for each subdivision. SLF subdivisions were successfully modeled in each subject, showing the dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral organization similar to that in nonhuman primate histological studies. We also found minimal differences between SLF-I models with and without the cingulate gyrus excluded, suggesting that the SLF-I may be a separable tract from the cingulum. Lastly, the SLF subdivisions showed differentiable associations with major cognitive domains such as memory and executive functions. While histological confirmation is needed beyond tractography, these probabilistic masks offer a first step in guiding future exploration of frontoparietal organization by providing detailed characterization of the SLF subdivisions and their potential cortical terminations.</p>

                <p>Auditory learning is supported by long-term changes in the neural processing of sound. We examined these task-depend changes in the auditory cortex by mapping neural sensitivity to timbre, pitch, and location cues in cues in trained (<I>n</I> = 5) and untrained control female ferrets (<I>n</I> = 5). Trained animals either identified vowels in a two-alternative forced choice task (<I>n</I> = 3) or discriminated when a repeating vowel changed in identity or pitch (<I>n</I> = 2). Neural responses were recorded under anesthesia in two primary auditory cortical fields and two tonotopically organized nonprimary fields. In trained animals, the overall sensitivity to sound timbre was reduced across three cortical fields compared with control animals, but maintained in a nonprimary field (the posterior pseudosylvian field). While training did not increase sensitivity to timbre across the auditory cortex, it did change the way in which neurons integrated spectral information, with neural responses in trained animals increasing their sensitivity to first and second formant frequencies, whereas in control animals cortical sensitivity to spectral timbre depended mostly on the second formant. Animals trained on timbre identification were required to generalize across pitch when discriminating timbre, and their neurons became less modulated by fundamental frequency relative to control animals. Finally, both trained groups showed increased spatial sensitivity and an enhanced response to sound source locations close to the midline, where the loudspeaker was located in the training chamber. These results demonstrate that training elicited widespread alterations in the cortical representation of complex sounds.</p>

                <p>Calcium imaging is a key method to record the spiking activity of identified and genetically targeted neurons. However, the observed calcium signals are only an indirect readout of the underlying electrophysiological events (single spikes or bursts of spikes) and require dedicated algorithms to recover the spike rate. These algorithms for spike inference can be optimized using ground truth data from combined electrical and optical recordings, but it is not clear how such optimized algorithms perform on cell types and brain regions for which ground truth does not exist. Here, we use a state-of-the-art algorithm based on supervised deep learning (CASCADE) and a nonsupervised algorithm based on non-negative deconvolution (OASIS) to test spike rate inference in spinal cord neurons. To enable these tests, we recorded specific ground truth from glutamatergic and GABAergic somatosensory neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord in mice of both sexes. We find that CASCADE and OASIS algorithms designed for cortical excitatory neurons generalize well to both spinal cord cell types. However, CASCADE models retrained on our ground truth further improved the performance, resulting in a more accurate inference of spiking activity from spinal cord neurons. We openly provide retrained models that can be applied to spinal cord data with variable noise levels and frame rates. Together, our ground truth recordings and analyses provide a solid foundation for the interpretation of calcium imaging data from spinal cord dorsal horn and showcase how spike rate inference can generalize between different regions of the nervous system.</p>

                <p>Despite the importance of odor detection to the survival of most animals, mechanisms governing olfactory sensitivity remain unclear, especially beyond the olfactory sensory neurons. Here, we leverage opto- and chemo-genetics to selectively modulate activities of CCKergic tufted cells (TCs) in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) of either sex, which form the intrabulbar associational system (IAS) to link isofunctional glomeruli, to determine the functional impact on OB output via mitral cells (MCs) and odor detection in behaving animals. NMDA receptors in CCKergic TCs remarkably amplify the OSN-evoked monosynaptic responses in these excitatory neurons, which provide a long-lasting feedforward excitation to MCs via both chemical transmission and electrical synapses between their apical dendrites. NMDA receptors in MCs mediate late components of the dendrodendritic TC-&gt;MC transmission to significantly boost MC output. Congruently, optogenetic inhibition of the CCKerigic TCs dramatically reduces the OSN-evoked MC responses. Unexpectedly, optogenetic activation of the axons projecting from CCKergic TCs on the opposite side of the same bulb produces mainly AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory responses in MCs, leading us to speculate that CCKergic TCs functionally synchronize MC output from mirror glomeruli. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of CCKergic TCs reduces animal&rsquo;s sensitivity to odors by elevating the detection threshold, consistent with the key role of these TCs in functionally controlling MC output. Collectively, our results delineate the cellular and circuit mechanisms allowing the CCKergic TCs to regulate MC output from glomeruli on both the medial and lateral sides of each OB and the system&rsquo;s sensitivity to odors possibly via the IAS.</p>

                <p>The amygdala is a cluster of subcortical nuclei that receives diverse sensory inputs and projects to the cortex, midbrain, and other subcortical structures. Numerous accounts of amygdalar contributions to social and emotional behavior have been offered, yet an overarching description of amygdala function remains elusive. Here, we adopt a computationally explicit framework that aims to develop a model of amygdala function based on the types of sensory inputs it receives, rather than individual constructs such as threat, arousal, or valence. Characterizing human fMRI signal acquired as male and female participants viewed a full-length film, we develop encoding models that predict both patterns of amygdala activity and self-reported valence evoked by naturalistic images. We use deep image synthesis to generate artificial stimuli that distinctly engage encoding models of amygdala subregions that systematically differ from one another in terms of their low-level visual properties. These findings characterize how the amygdala compresses high-dimensional sensory inputs into low-dimensional representations relevant to behavior.</p>

                <p>Our consummatory decisions depend on the taste of food and the reward experienced while eating, which are processed through neural computations in interconnected brain areas. Although many gustatory regions of rodents have been explored, the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) remains understudied. The MD, a multimodal brain area connected with gustatory centers, is often studied for its role in processing associative and cognitive information and has been shown to represent intraorally delivered chemosensory stimuli after strong retronasal odor&ndash;taste associations. Key questions remain about whether MD neurons can process taste quality independently of odor&ndash;taste associations and how they represent extraoral signals predicting rewarding and aversive gustatory outcomes. Here, using C57 male and female mice, we present electrophysiological evidence demonstrating how MD neurons represent and encode (1) the identity and concentrations of basic taste qualities during active licking and (2) auditory signals anticipating rewarding and aversive taste outcomes. Our data reveal that MD neurons can reliably and dynamically encode taste identity in a broadly tuned manner and taste concentrations with spiking activity positively and negatively correlated with stimulus intensity. Our data also show that MD can represent information related to predictive cues and their associated outcomes, regardless of whether the cue predicts a rewarding or aversive outcome. In summary, our findings suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus is integral to the taste pathway, as it can encode sensory-discriminative dimensions of tastants and participate in processing associative information essential for ingestive behaviors.</p>

                <p>What is the secret of human intelligence? A key discovery in psychology is that performance correlations across diverse cognitive tasks are explained by a few broad abilities and one overarching general factor, which is also predictive of real-life achievements. Whether these factors correspond to biological processes is a century-old debate. While previous research focused on localizing their correlates in brain structure, connectivity, and activation levels, the mechanisms of neural information processing related to intelligence are still unexplored. I outline a new approach integrating psychometrics with neuroscientific advances in identifying the computations underlying single tasks from their representational geometry to provide a novel perspective on this topic. In particular, I propose a neural process account of the general factor that builds on the central role of structure mapping&mdash;the process of abstracting and reasoning based on relational knowledge&mdash;in human cognition. Neural coding properties in the hippocampal and prefrontal&ndash;parietal systems that enable inferential leaps through structural abstraction might contribute to the general factor. In general, integrating neuro-representational and psychometric research has the potential to uncover core principles of natural intelligence.</p>

                <p>Every movement requires the nervous system to solve a complex biomechanical control problem, but this process is mostly veiled from one&rsquo;s conscious awareness. Simultaneously, we also have conscious experience of controlling our movements&mdash;our sense of agency (SoA). Whether SoA corresponds to those neural representations that implement actual neuromuscular control is an open question with ethical, medical, and legal implications. If SoA is the conscious experience of control, this predicts that SoA can be decoded from the same brain structures that implement the so-called "inverse dynamics" computations for planning movement. We correlated human (male and female) fMRI measurements during hand movements with the internal representations of a deep neural network performing the same hand control task in a biomechanical simulation&mdash;revealing detailed cortical encodings of sensorimotor states, idiosyncratic to each subject. We then manipulated SoA by usurping control of participants&rsquo; muscles via electrical stimulation and found that the same voxels which were best explained by modeled inverse dynamics representations&mdash;which, strikingly, were located in canonically visual areas&mdash;also predicted SoA. Importantly, model-brain correspondences and robust SoA decoding could both be achieved within single subjects, enabling relationships between motor representations and awareness to be studied at the level of the individual.</p>

                <p>Some decisions, such as selecting a food item in a novel menu, are not based on rational norms, or on trained habits, but on subjective preferences. How the human brain makes these preference-based decisions is still debated in cognitive neuroscience. Classical models focus on the comparison mechanism that achieves the selection of the option with best expected value. Recent models suggest that estimates of option values are refined until reaching sufficient confidence in the considered choice. Neuroimaging studies in humans and electrophysiology studies in animals have gathered evidence that value and confidence estimates are both represented in the medial and lateral regions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Here, we took advantage of electrodes implanted within the OFC of human patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (14 women, 12 men) to investigate whether value and confidence estimates can be dissociated in electrophysiology activity recorded during preference-based binary decisions. The overall value (likeability ratings summed over options) and choice confidence (selection probability of the chosen option) were identified in low-frequency (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) OFC activity. These value and confidence signals were time-locked to the decision, showed opposite signs of correlation, and were recorded in separate sites. This pattern of results is not consistent with the simulations of an attractor neural network model implementing a comparison of option values. However, it is compatible with the notion of a neural network generating sparse representations of option values and choice confidence estimates, based on which decisions can be made.</p>

                <p>Peripheral and brain-produced sex hormones exert sex-specific regulation of hippocampal cognitive function. Estrogens produced by neuronal aromatase regulate inhibitory neurons (INs) and hippocampal-dependent memory in adult female mice, but not in males. How and when this sex effect is established and how peripheral and brain sources of estrogens interact in the control of hippocampal INs is currently unknown. Using ex vivo electrophysiology, fiber photometry, molecular analysis, estrous cycle monitoring, and neonatal hormonal manipulations, we unveil estrous cycle-dependent and estrous cycle-independent features of CA1 parvalbumin (PV) INs and hippocampal inhibition in adult female mice. Before puberty, aromatase is expressed in PV INs and regulates synaptic inhibition in female but not in male mice. Neonatal testosterone administration altered prepubertal female mouse hippocampus-dependent memory, PV IN function and estrogenic regulation of adult female synaptic inhibition and PV IN perineuronal nets. Our results suggest that sex differences in brain-derived estrogen regulation of CA1 inhibition are established by organizational effects of neonatal gonadal hormones and highlight the role of INs as mediators of the sexual differentiation of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>Sensory systems must perform the dual and opposing tasks of being sensitive to weak stimuli while also maintaining information content in dense and variable sensory landscapes. This occurs in the olfactory system, where olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are highly sensitive to low concentrations of odors and maintain discriminability in complex odor environments. How OSNs maintain both sensitivity and sparsity is poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether the calcium-activated chloride channel, TMEM16B, may support these dual roles in OSNs in both male and female mice. We used multiphoton microscopy to image the stimulus&ndash;response density of OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. In TMEM16B knock-out mice, we found that sensory representations were denser, and the magnitude of OSN responses was increased. Behaviorally, these changes in sensory representations were associated with an increased aversion to the odorant trimethylamine, which switches perceptual valence as its concentration increases, and a decreased efficiency of olfactory-guided navigation. Our results indicate that the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16B sparsens sensory representations in the peripheral olfactory system and contributes to efficient integrative olfactory-guided behaviors.</p>

                <p>Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest generated cortical neurons that form functional cortical synapses and aid in cortical circuit development. A fraction of SpNs survive and form Layer (L)6b in the adult cortex. While SpNs exhibit a large variety of molecular identities, it is unclear if molecular identity correlates with their functional circuits and if different SpNs have similar developmental trajectories. To resolve these questions, we here characterize the functional intracortical circuits to molecularly identified subpopulations of SpNs with SpN-specific Cre-lines [connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)-dgCre and dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1)-Cre] in in vitro brain slices of the primary auditory cortex using whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings and laser-scanning photostimulation. We targeted three age groups: before [Postnatal Day (P)7&ndash;P9] and after (P14&ndash;P20) the ear canal opening and when circuits are mature (P60&ndash;P80). While the excitatory intracortical circuits impinging on both subtypes were similar, inhibitory circuits differed, particularly those from subplate/L6b. At P7&ndash;P9, Drd1 neurons received stronger inhibition from the subplate compared with CTGF neurons. The functional circuits on SpNs prune with age. By P60&ndash;P80, the inhibitory connections from L6b on CTGF neurons increased and became significantly abundant than those on Drd1 neurons. However, the inhibition strength between the two subtypes remained unchanged. Thus, SpNs exhibit diverse neuronal morphologies and intracortical input patterns, independent of molecular expression. Thus, although the subplate comprises distinct molecular neural classes, molecular expression is not clearly correlated with neural morphologies and functional circuits throughout development.</p>

By quantifying participants&rsquo; learning rates through an Actor&ndash;Critic model, we discovered that periods of accelerated learning were characterized by significant manifold contractions across multiple brain regions, including areas of limbic and hippocampal cortex, as well as the cerebellum. This contraction reflected enhanced network integration, with notably stronger connectivity between several of these regions and the sensorimotor cerebellum correlating with higher learning rates. These findings challenge the traditional view of the cerebellum as solely involved in error-based learning, supporting the emerging view that it coordinates with other brain regions during reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>Early life stress (ELS) has been shown to disrupt cognitive and limbic functions, yet its impact on sensory systems, particularly the auditory system, remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigated the enduring effects of ELS induced by neonatal maternal separation (MS) on behavioral and cortical processing of sound azimuth in adult male rats. We found that MS significantly impairs sound-azimuth discrimination, paralleled by broader azimuth tuning and reduced dendritic branching and spine density in neurons within the primary auditory cortex. Notably, exposure to an enriched acoustic environment during the stress period effectively protects against these MS-induced alterations, restoring behavioral performance, cortical tuning, and dendritic spine density of neurons to levels comparable with controls. Further analyses reveal that epigenetic regulation of cortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor by histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation may underlie the observed changes in cortical structure and function. These results underscore the profound and lasting impact of MS-induced ELS on auditory processing, particularly within cortical circuits involved in spatial processing. They suggest that sensory enrichment is a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the adverse effects of ELS on sensory processing, with broader implications for understanding and treating sensory deficits in stress-related disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/18/e2347242025?rss=1">Neural Dynamics of Reselecting Visual and Motor Contents in Working Memory after External Interference</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday tasks, we must often shift our focus away from internal representations held in working memory to engage with perceptual events in the external world. Here, we investigated how our internal focus is reestablished following an interrupting task by tracking the reselection of visual representations and their associated action plans in working memory. Specifically, we asked whether reselection occurs for both visual and motor memory attributes and when this reselection occurs. We developed a visual-motor working-memory task in which participants were retrospectively cued to select one of two memory items before being interrupted by a perceptual discrimination task. To determine what information was reselected, the memory items had distinct visual and motor attributes. To determine when internal representations were reselected, the interrupting task was presented at one of three distinct time points following the retro-cue. We employed electroencephalography time&ndash;frequency analyses to track the initial selection and later reselection of visual and motor representations, as operationalized through modulations of posterior alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) activity relative to the memorized item location (visual) and of central beta (13&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) activity relative to the required response hand (motor). Our results show that internal visual and motor contents were concurrently reselected immediately after completing the interrupting task, rather than only when internal information was required for memory-guided behavior. Thus, following interruption, we swiftly resume our internal focus in working memory through the simultaneous reselection of memorized visual representations and their associated action plans, thereby restoring internal contents to a ready-to-use state.</p>

                <p>by James Webb, Paul Steffan, Benjamin Y. Hayden, Daeyeol Lee, Caleb Kemere, Matthew McGinley</p>

Foraging theory predicts animal behavior in many contexts. In patch-based foraging behaviors, the marginal value theorem (MVT) gives the optimal strategy for deterministic environments whose parameters are fully known to the forager. In natural settings, environmental parameters exhibit variability and are only partially known to the animal based on its experience, creating uncertainty. Models of uncertainty in foraging are well established. However, natural environments also exhibit unpredicted changes in their statistics. As a result, animals must ascertain whether the currently observed quality of the environment is consistent with their internal models, or whether something has changed, creating meta-uncertainty. Behavioral strategies for optimizing foraging behavior under meta-uncertainty, and their neural underpinnings, are largely unknown. Here, we developed a novel behavioral task and computational framework for studying patch-leaving decisions in head-fixed and freely moving mice in conditions of meta-uncertainty. We stochastically varied between-patch travel time, as well as within-patch reward depletion rate. We find that, when uncertainty is minimal, mice adopt patch residence times in a manner consistent with the MVT and not explainable by simple ethologically motivated heuristic strategies. However, behavior in highly variable environments was best explained by modeling both first- and second-order uncertainty in environmental parameters, wherein local variability and global statistics are captured by a Bayesian estimator and dynamic prior, respectively. Thus, mice forage under meta-uncertainty by employing a hierarchical Bayesian strategy, which is essential for efficiently foraging in volatile environments. The results provide a foundation for understanding the neural basis of decision-making that exhibits naturalistic meta-uncertainty.

                <p>by Tessa M. Vergroesen, Vincent Vermeulen, Roeland M. H. Merks</p>

During angiogenesis, endothelial cells expand the vasculature by migrating from existing blood vessels, proliferating and collectively organizing into new capillaries. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimentation is instrumental for identifying the molecular players and cell behaviour that regulate angiogenesis. Alongside experimental work, computational and mathematical models of endothelial cell network formation have helped to analyse if the current molecular and cellular understanding of endothelial cell behaviour is sufficient to explain the formation of endothelial cell networks. As input, the models take (a subset of) the current knowledge or hypotheses of single cell behaviour and capture it into a dynamical, mathematical description. As output, they predict the multicellular behaviour following from the actions of many individual cells, <i>i.e.</i>, formation of a vascular-like network. Paradoxically, computational modelling based on different assumptions, <i>i.e.</i>, completely different, sometimes non-intersecting sets of observed single cell behaviour, can reproduce the same angiogenesis-like multicellular behaviour, making it practically impossible to decide which, if any, of these models is correct. Here we present dynamical analyses of time-lapses of <i>in vitro</i> endothelial cell network formation experiments and compare these with dynamic analyses of three mathematical models: (1) the cell elongation model; (2) the contact-inhibited chemotaxis model; and (3) the mechanical cell-cell communication model. We extract a variety of dynamical characteristics of endothelial cell network formation using a custom time-lapse video analysis pipeline in ImageJ. We compare the dynamical network characteristics of the <i>in vitro</i> experiments to those of the cellular networks produced by the computational models. We test the response of the <i>in silico</i> dynamical cell network characteristics to changes in cell density and make related changes in the <i>in vitro</i> experiments. Of the three computational models that we have considered, the cell elongation model best captures the remodelling phase of <i>in vitro</i> endothelial cell network formation. Furthermore, in the <i>in vitro</i> model, the final size and number of lacunae in the network are independent of the initial cell density. This observation is also reproduced in the cell elongation model, but not in the other two models that we have considered. Altogether, we present an approach to model validation based on comparisons of time-resolved data and variations of model conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012290">Heuristic energy-based cyclic peptide design</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qiyao Zhu, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, Dennis Shasha</p>

Rational computational design is crucial to the pursuit of novel drugs and therapeutic agents. Meso-scale cyclic peptides, which consist of 7-40 amino acid residues, are of particular interest due to their conformational rigidity, binding specificity, degradation resistance, and potential cell permeability. Because there are few natural cyclic peptides, <i>de novo</i> design involving non-canonical amino acids is a potentially useful goal. Here, we develop an efficient pipeline (CyclicChamp) for cyclic peptide design. After converting the cyclic constraint into an error function, we employ a variant of simulated annealing to search for low-energy peptide backbones while maintaining peptide closure. Compared to the previous random sampling approach, which was capable of sampling conformations of cyclic peptides of up to 14 residues, our method both greatly accelerates the computation speed for sampling conformations of small macrocycles (<i>ca</i>. 7 residues), and addresses the high-dimensionality challenge that large macrocycle designs often encounter. As a result, CyclicChamp makes conformational sampling tractable for 15- to 24-residue cyclic peptides, thus permitting the design of macrocycles in this size range. Microsecond-length molecular dynamics simulations on the resulting 15, 20, and 24 amino acid cyclic designs identify designs with kinetic stability. To test their thermodynamic stability, we perform additional replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and generate free energy surfaces. Three 15-residue designs, one 20-residue and one 24-residue design emerge as promising candidates.

A critical step before data-sharing of human neuroimaging is removing facial features to protect individuals’ privacy. However, not only does this process redact identifiable information about individuals, but it also removes non-identifiable information. This introduces undesired variability into downstream analysis and interpretation. This registered report investigated the degree to which the so-called <i>defacing</i> altered the quality assessment of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images of the human brain from the openly available “IXI dataset”. The effect of defacing on manual quality assessment was investigated on a single-site subset of the dataset (<i>N</i> = 185). By comparing two linear mixed-effects models, we determined that four trained human raters’ perception of quality was significantly influenced by defacing by modeling their ratings on the same set of images in two conditions: “nondefaced” (i.e., preserving facial features) and “defaced”. In addition, we investigated these biases on automated quality assessments by applying repeated-measures, multivariate ANOVA (rm-MANOVA) on the image quality metrics extracted with <i>MRIQC</i> on the full IXI dataset (<i>N</i> = 581; three acquisition sites). This study found that defacing altered the quality assessments by humans and showed that <i>MRIQC</i>’s quality metrics were mostly insensitive to defacing.

                Neuronal synapses function within a multifaceted neuropil ecosystem, incorporating astroglia, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Hodebourg et al. review how perisynaptic ecosystems shape synaptic signaling and plasticity, emphasizing the need to consider all cell types to understand adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.

                Lish et al. reveal that AD-protective CLU alleles enhance CLU upregulation in response to accumulated neuropathology, thereby dampening inflammatory signaling between microglia and astrocytes. Using several complementary approaches, they show that CLU upregulation in astrocytes protects neurons from microglia-mediated induction of phospho-tau and synapse loss.

                Sharma et al. show that the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1ɑ is activated in infected lungs, where myeloid IRE1ɑ exacerbates inflammation, cell death, and lung injury. Ablation of myeloid IRE1ɑ or global IRE1ɑ inhibition augments type II interferon response and protects mice against MRSA primary and secondary to influenza pneumonia.
