	<p>Intracranial hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors, accounting for 1% of all central nervous system malignancies. This tumor is considered at high risk of local and also distant metastases. Surgical excision is the gold standard for treatment, but it is seldom curative by itself. Adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended. We report an overview and update of the available literature on one such rare but aggressive mesenchymal tumor, using the case of a 46-year-old woman affected by hemangiopericytoma of the cavernous sinus surgically removed and treated with adjuvant radiotherapy at our institution. After seven years, the patient underwent a local recurrence and was treated with exeresis and Gamma Knife radiotherapy. Sixteen years after the initial diagnosis, she is still well with stable disease.</p>

	<p>Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex functionally debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, with associated social cognitive impairment. Corpus Callosum (CC) white matter tracts deficits are reported for people with schizophrenia; however, few studies focus on interhemispheric processing relative to social cognition tasks. This study aimed to determine if a relationship between the CC and social cognition exists. Method: In this cross-section study, a sample of n = 178 typical controls and n = 58 people with schizophrenia completed measures of mentalising (Reading the Mind in the Eyes), emotion recognition outcome and reaction time (Emotion Recognition Test), and clinical symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale), alongside diffusion-based tract imaging. The CC and its subregions, i.e., the genu, body, and splenium were the regions of interest (ROI). Results: Reduced white matter tract integrity was observed in the CC for patients when compared to controls. Patients performed slower, and less accurately on emotion recognition tasks, which significantly and negatively correlated to the structural integrity of the CC genu. Tract integrity further significantly and negatively related to clinical symptomatology. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia have altered white matter integrity in the genu of the CC, compared to controls, which relates to cognitive deficits associated with recognising emotional stimuli accurately and quickly, and severity of clinical symptoms.</p>

<p>Using extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging genetically targeted to different layer 5 cell classes, we characterize the spatial frequency (SF), temporal frequency (TF), and speed tuning of deep (layer 5/6) cortical neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual cortical areas anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM). We find that deep-layer neurons, like superficial layer neurons, are functionally specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies in different visual areas. However, we also found a larger range of preferred SFs and TFs than previously reported in superficial cortical layers. We also find that direction tuning is much more prominent for layer 5 extratelencephalically than layer 5 intratelencephalically projecting neurons in multiple visual areas.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mouse visual system consists of several visual cortical areas thought to be specialized for different visual features and/or tasks. Previous studies have revealed differences between primary visual cortex (V1) and other higher visual areas, namely, anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM), and their tuning preferences for spatial and temporal frequency. However, these differences have primarily been characterized using methods that are biased toward superficial layers of cortex, such as two-photon calcium imaging. Fewer studies have investigated cell types in deeper layers of these areas and their tuning preferences. Because superficial versus deep-layer neurons and different types of deep-layer neurons are known to have different feedforward and feedback inputs and outputs, comparing the tuning preferences of these groups is important for understanding cortical visual information processing. In this study, we used extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging targeted toward two different layer 5 cell classes to characterize their tuning properties in V1, AL, and PM. We find that deep-layer neurons, similar to superficial layer neurons, are also specialized for different spatial and temporal frequencies, with the strongest differences between AL and V1, and AL and PM, but not V1 and PM. However, we note that the deep-layer neuron populations preferred a larger range of SFs and TFs compared to previous studies. We also find that extratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons are more direction selective than intratelencephalically projecting layer 5 neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perceived risk of infection and death from COVID-19 among community members of low- and middle-income countries: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Risk perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered important as they impact community health behaviors. The aim of this study was to determine the perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 and to assess the factors associated with such risk perceptions among community members in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Asia, and South America. Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 LMICs in Africa, Asia, and South America from February to May 2021. A questionnaire was utilized to assess the perceived risk of infection and death from COVID-19 and its plausible determinants. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with such risk perceptions. Results: A total of 1,646 responses were included in the analysis of the perceived risk of becoming infected and dying from COVID-19. Our data suggested that 36.4% of participants had a high perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, while only 22.4% had a perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Being a woman, working in healthcare-related sectors, contracting pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, as well as seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV were all associated with a higher perceived risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. In addition, being a woman, elderly, having heart disease and pulmonary disease, knowing people in the immediate social environment who are or have been infected with COVID-19, and seeing or reading about individuals infected with COVID-19 on social media or TV had a higher perceived risk of dying from COVID-19. Conclusions: The perceived risk of infection and death due to COVID-19 are relatively low among respondents; this suggests the need to conduct health campaigns to disseminate knowledge and information on the ongoing pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Soluble FMS-Like Tyrosine Kinase-1: Role in placenta accreta spectrum disorder [version 4; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Placenta accreta is a pregnancy condition where the placenta's blood vessels attach too deeply to the uterine wall. Incidence of placenta accreta  is increasingly seen today as the rate of cesarean section increases, however, the exact pathophysiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1  (sflt-1) as a protein produced by the placenta was found to be decreased in placenta accreta, Therefore we aim  to see if  sfltsFlt-1 has a role in the development of placenta accreta. Methods: This study involved 40 samples from patients that had been diagnosed with placenta accreta spectrum disorder (case group), and 40 samples from patients with normal pregnancies (control group)  at Rumah Skit Umum Pusat H.Adam Malik (RSUP) Haji Adam Malik Medan, in Indonesia.  Diagnosis of placenta accreta syndrome was based on Placenta Accreta Spectrum  Score (PAS), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  (FIGO) classification of placenta accreta spectrum disorder.Analyses  were performed by independent t-test, man Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis test, with a P-value <0.05  considered as statistically significant (95%CI). Results: Based on this study, we found that the sFlt-1 level in the case group was lower than the control group. Data analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a difference in sFlt-1 levels in this study group (p = 0.02), which was further evaluated  with post hoc analysis using Mann. -Whitney U test. The results indicated that there were significant differences between the control and PAS 0, PAS1, and PAS 2 (p = 0.043; p = 0.002; p = 0.03). Conclusion: sFlt-1 levels decreased in placental invasive pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies, however, this still needs to be investigated further in a multi-center study, considering that sFlt-1 levels are also influenced by ethnicity and other conditions that cannot be excluded in this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Leptin is an adipokine hormone that regulates insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, which may contribute to complications like gestational diabetes.The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) and lipid profile by automated chemistry analyzer. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Depression among pet owners and non-pet owners: a comparative cross-sectional study in Dhaka, Bangladesh [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression is a major contributor to overall global disease burden, often beginning in the teenage years and continuing into later life. Previous studies have reported high global rates of depression during these formative years, including in Bangladesh. At the same time, the positive impact that pet ownership can have on depression is steeply  being recognized. However, studies examining these effects in Bangladesh are scarce. This study examined the association between household pet ownership and depression among people older than 13 years in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using online and offline approaches. We employed a snowball sampling technique to identify pet owners aged greater than 13 years residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Both web-based survey questionnaires using social media and hard copies were used to collect data from urban-dwelling pet owners. Logistic regression model was used to identify the independent role of pet ownership in depression, adjusting for confounders, including age, sex, marital status, known chronic disabilities, and other variables. Results: A total of 140 pet owners and an equal number of non-pet owners participated in the study. Pet owners were found to be 41% less depressed than non-pet owners (AOR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.31–1.14). In addition, males (AOR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.50–7.62) who were either unmarried (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.05–4.16), smoked tobacco (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50–18.53), or had a physical disability (AOR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.50–18.53) were significantly more likely to be depressed. Conclusion: Regression analysis revealed that in Dhaka, pet owners were associated with lower levels of depression compared to non-pet owners.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Extensive digital gangrene as a primary manifestation of late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Digital gangrene is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It occurs usually in middle-aged patients with longer disease duration. Case: Herein we report the case of a 56-year-old man (with no history suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon, diabetes mellitus, smoking, trauma, infection, or chemical exposure), who presented with SLE and digital gangrene was among the first signs. He presented with a one-month history of joint pain, hair loss, photosensitivity, mouth ulcers, malar rash, dyspnea, and digital pain. Physical examination revealed painful and diffuse erythematous skin lesions in the extremities and back, as well as cyanosis in the fingers. We noted lymphocytopenia (600 cells/mm3), and an elevated C-reactive protein (15.1 mg/l) on laboratory tests. Immunological tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with Title 1:400. Pulmonary computed tomography revealed pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary function tests revealed the restrictive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of SLE with lung involvement was retained. The immunological assessment in search of elements in favor of a vascular origin of the patient's skin lesions was negative. Treatment was initiated with 200 mg/day hydroxychloroquine. For dermal and pulmonary involvement, intravenous (IV) pulse therapy was used with methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/d for three consecutive days monthly) and cyclophosphamide (1 g/month). Calcium blocking agents were also prescribed. However, the lesions did not improve. The patient was given two infusions of rituximab (1 g) at a 14-day interval with a marked improvement of the majority of vasculitis lesions, and a partial improvement of dyspnea. Conclusions: Digital gangrene is a rare complication of late-onset SLE, especially as a primary manifestation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Feature-Based Attention Multiplicatively Scales the fMRI-BOLD Contrast-Response Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>fMRI plays a key role in the study of attention. However, there remains a puzzling discrepancy between attention effects measured with fMRI and with electrophysiological methods. While electrophysiological studies find that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses by multiplicatively scaling the contrast-response function (CRF), fMRI appears to be insensitive to these multiplicative effects. Instead, fMRI studies typically find that attention produces an additive baseline shift in the BOLD signal. These findings suggest that attentional effects measured with fMRI reflect top-down inputs to visual cortex, rather than the modulation of sensory gain. If true, this drastically limits what fMRI can tell us about how attention improves sensory coding. Here, we examined whether fMRI is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention using a feature-based attention paradigm designed to preclude any possible additive effects. We measured BOLD activity evoked by a probe stimulus in one visual hemifield while participants (6 male, 6 female) attended to the probe orientation (attended condition), or to an orthogonal orientation (unattended condition), in the other hemifield. To measure CRFs in visual areas V1-V3, we parametrically varied the contrast of the probe stimulus. In all three areas, feature-based attention increased contrast gain, improving sensitivity by shifting CRFs toward lower contrasts. In V2 and V3, we also found an increase in response gain, an increase in the responsivity of the CRF, that was greatest at inner eccentricities. These results provide clear evidence that the fMRI-BOLD signal is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> fMRI plays a central role in the study of attention because it allows researchers to precisely and noninvasively characterize the effects of attention throughout the brain. Electrophysiological studies have shown that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses. However, a growing body of work suggests that the BOLD signal that is measured with fMRI is not sensitive to these multiplicative effects of attention, calling into question what we can learn from fMRI about how attention improves sensory codes. Here, using a feature-based attention paradigm, we provide evidence that the BOLD signal can pick up multiplicative effects of attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Efferent Reflexes in the Efficient Encoding of Speech by the Auditory Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <p>To avoid information loss, the auditory system must adapt the broad dynamic range of natural sounds to the restricted dynamic range of auditory nerve fibers. How it solves this dynamic range problem is not fully understood. Recent electrophysiological studies showed that dynamic-range adaptation occurs at the auditory nerve level, but the amount of adaptation found was insufficient to prevent information loss. We used the physiological MATLAB Auditory Periphery model to study the contribution of efferent reflexes to dynamic range adaptation. Simulating the healthy human auditory periphery provided adaptation predictions that suggest that the acoustic reflex shifts rate-level functions toward a given context level and the medial olivocochlear reflex sharpens the response of nerve fibers around that context level. A simulator of hearing was created to decode model-predicted firing of the auditory nerve back into an acoustic signal, for use in psychophysical tasks. Speech reception thresholds in noise obtained with a normal-hearing implementation of the simulator were just 1 dB above those measured with unprocessed stimuli. This result validates the simulator for speech stimuli. Disabling efferent reflexes elevated thresholds by 4 dB, reaching thresholds found in mild-to-moderately hearing-impaired individuals. Overall, our studies suggest that efferent reflexes may contribute to overcoming the dynamic range problem. Because specific sensorineural pathologies can be inserted in the model, the simulator can be used to obtain the psychophysical signatures of each pathology, thereby laying a path to differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The saturation of auditory nerve fibers at moderate sound levels seen in rate-level functions challenges our understanding of how sounds of wide dynamic range are encoded. Our physiologically inspired simulations suggest that efferent reflexes may play a major role in dynamic range adaptation, with the acoustic reflex moving auditory nerve rate-level function toward a given context level and the medial olivocochlear reflex increasing fiber sensitivity around that context level. A psychophysical task using advanced simulations showed how the existence of the efferent system could prevent unrecoverable information loss and severe impairment of speech-in-noise intelligibility. These findings illustrate how important the precise modeling of peripheral compression is to both simulations and the understanding of normal and impaired hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Loss of Muscarinic M5 Receptor Function Manifests Disparate Impairments in Exploratory Behavior in Male and Female Mice despite Common Dopamine Regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are five cloned muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1&ndash;M5). Of these, the muscarinic type 5 receptor (M5) is the only one localized to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. Unlike M1&ndash;M4, the M5 receptor has relatively restricted expression in the brain, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we performed an in-depth characterization of M5-dependent potentiation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens and accompanying exploratory behaviors in male and female mice. We show that M5 receptors potentiate dopamine transmission by acting directly on the terminals within the nucleus accumbens. Using the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, we revealed a unique concentration&ndash;response curve and a sensitivity to repeated forced swim stress or restraint stress exposure. We found that constitutive deletion of M5 receptors reduced exploration of the center of an open field while at the same time impairing normal habituation only in male mice. In addition, M5 deletion reduced exploration of salient stimuli, especially under conditions of high novelty, yet had no effect on hedonia assayed using the sucrose preference test or on stress-coping strategy assayed using the forced swim test. We conclude that M5 receptors are critical for both engaging with the environment and updating behavioral output in response to environment cues, specifically in male mice. A cardinal feature of mood and anxiety disorders is withdrawal from the environment. These data indicate that boosting M5 receptor activity may be a useful therapeutic target for ameliorating these symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basic physiological and behavioral functions of the muscarinic M5 receptor remain understudied. Furthermore, its presence on dopamine neurons, relatively restricted expression in the brain, and recent crystallization make it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Yet, most preclinical studies of M5 receptor function have primarily focused on substance use disorders in male rodents. Here, we characterized the role of M5 receptors in potentiating dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, finding impaired functioning after stress exposure. Furthermore, we show that M5 receptors can modulate exploratory behavior in a sex-specific manner, without affecting hedonic behavior. These findings further illustrate the therapeutic potential of the M5 receptor, warranting further research in the context of treating mood disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learning from Ingroup Experiences Changes Intergroup Impressions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans form impressions toward individuals of their own social groups (ingroup members) and of different social groups (outgroup members). Outgroup-focused theories predict that intergroup impressions are mainly shaped by experiences with outgroup individuals, while ingroup-focused theories predict that ingroup experiences play a dominant role. Here we test predictions from these two psychological theories by estimating how intergroup impressions are dynamically shaped when people learn from both ingroup and outgroup experiences. While undergoing fMRI, male participants had identical experiences with different ingroup or outgroup members and rated their social closeness and impressions toward the ingroup and the outgroup. Behavioral results showed an initial ingroup bias in impression ratings which was significantly reduced over the course of learning, with larger effects in individuals with stronger ingroup identification. Computational learning models revealed that these changes in intergroup impressions were predicted by the weight given to ingroup prediction errors. Neurally, the individual weight for ingroup prediction errors was related to the coupling between the left inferior parietal lobule and the left anterior insula, which, in turn, predicted learning-related changes in intergroup impressions. Our findings provide computational and neural evidence for ingroup-focused theories, highlighting the importance of ingroup experiences in shaping social impressions in intergroup settings.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Living in multicultural societies, humans interact with individuals of their own social groups (ingroup members) and of different social groups (outgroup members). However, little is known about how people learn from the mixture of ingroup and outgroup interactions, the most natural experiences in current societies. Here, participants had identical, intermixed experiences with different ingroup and outgroup individuals and rated their closeness and impressions toward the ingroup and the outgroup. Combining computational models and fMRI, we find that the weight given to ingroup experiences (ingroup prediction errors) is the main source of intergroup impression change, captured by changes in connectivity between the parietal lobe and insula. These findings highlight the importance of ingroup experiences in shaping intergroup impressions in complex social environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Complementary Roles of Primate Dorsal Premotor and Pre-Supplementary Motor Areas to the Control of Motor Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are able to temporally organize multiple movements in a purposeful manner in everyday life. Both the dorsal premotor (PMd) area and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are known to be involved in the performance of motor sequences. However, it is unclear how each area differentially contributes to controlling multiple motor sequences. To address this issue, we recorded single-unit activity in both areas while monkeys (one male, one female) performed sixteen motor sequences. Each sequence comprised either a series of two identical movements (repetition) or two different movements (nonrepetition). The sequence was initially instructed with visual signals but had to be remembered thereafter. Here, we showed that the activity of single neurons in both areas transitioned from reactive- to predictive encoding while motor sequences were memorized. In the memory-guided trials, in particular, the activity of PMd cells preferentially represented the second movement (2M) in the sequence leading to a reward generally regardless of the first movement (1M). Such activity frequently began even before the 1M in a prospective manner, and was enhanced in nonrepetition sequences. Behaviorally, a lack of the activity enhancement often resulted in premature execution of the 2M. In contrast, cells in pre-SMA instantiated particular sequences of actions by coordinating switching or nonswitching movements in sequence. Our findings suggest that PMd and pre-SMA play complementary roles within behavioral contexts: PMd preferentially controls the movement that leads to a reward rather than the sequence per se, whereas pre-SMA coordinates all elements in a sequence by integrating temporal orders of multiple movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although both dorsal premotor (PMd) area and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are involved in the control of motor sequences, it is not clear how these two areas contribute to coordination of sequential movements differently. To address this issue, we directly compared neuronal activity in the two areas recorded while monkeys memorized and performed multiple motor sequences. Our findings suggest that PMd preferentially controls the final action that ultimately leads to a reward in a prospective manner, whereas the pre-SMA coordinates switching among multiple actions within the context of the sequence. Our findings are of significance to understand the distinct roles for motor-related areas in the planning and executing motor sequences and the pathophysiology of apraxia and/or Parkinson's diseases that disables skilled motor actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiple Sources of Fast Traveling Waves during Human Seizures: Resolving a Controversy</a></h4>

              
                <p>During human seizures, organized waves of voltage activity rapidly sweep across the cortex. Two contradictory theories describe the source of these fast traveling waves: either a slowly advancing narrow region of multiunit activity (an ictal wavefront) or a fixed cortical location. Limited observations and different analyses prevent resolution of these incompatible theories. Here we address this disagreement by combining the methods and microelectrode array recordings (<I>N</I> = 11 patients, 2 females, <I>N</I> = 31 seizures) from previous human studies to analyze the traveling wave source. We find, inconsistent with both existing theories, a transient relationship between the ictal wavefront and traveling waves, and multiple stable directions of traveling waves in many seizures. Using a computational model that combines elements of both existing theories, we show that interactions between an ictal wavefront and fixed source reproduce the traveling wave dynamics observed <I>in vivo</I>. We conclude that combining both existing theories can generate the diversity of ictal traveling waves.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The source of voltage discharges that propagate across cortex during human seizures remains unknown. Two candidate theories exist, each proposing a different discharge source. Support for each theory consists of observations from a small number of human subject recordings, analyzed with separately developed methods. How the different, limited data and different analysis methods impact the evidence for each theory is unclear. To resolve these differences, we combine the unique, human microelectrode array recordings collected separately for each theory and analyze these combined data with a unified approach. We show that neither existing theory adequately describes the data. We then propose a new theory that unifies existing proposals and successfully reproduces the voltage discharge dynamics observed <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retinoschisin Deficiency Induces Persistent Aberrant Waves of Activity Affecting Neuroglial Signaling in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genetic disorders that present during development make treatment strategies particularly challenging because there is a need to disentangle primary pathophysiology from downstream dysfunction caused at key developmental stages. To provide a deeper insight into this question, we studied a mouse model of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, an early-onset inherited condition caused by mutations in the <I>Rs1</I> gene encoding retinoschisin (RS1) and characterized by cystic retinal lesions and early visual deficits. Using an unbiased approach in expressing the fast intracellular calcium indicator GCaMP6f in neuronal, glial, and vascular cells of the retina of RS1-deficient male mice, we found that initial cyst formation is paralleled by the appearance of aberrant spontaneous neuroglial signals as early as postnatal day 15, when eyes normally open. These presented as glutamate-driven wavelets of neuronal activity and sporadic radial bursts of activity by Mu&#x0308;ller glia, spanning all retinal layers and disrupting light-induced signaling. This study confers a role to RS1 beyond its function as an adhesion molecule, identifies an early onset for dysfunction in the course of disease, establishing a potential window for disease diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developmental disorders make it difficult to distinguish pathophysiology due to ongoing disease from pathophysiology due to disrupted development. Here, we investigated a mouse model for X-linked retinoschisis, a well defined monogenic degenerative disease caused by mutations in the <I>Rs1</I> gene, which codes for the protein retinoschisin. We evaluated the spontaneous activity of explanted retinas lacking retinoschisin at key stages of development using the unbiased approach of ubiquitously expressing GCaMP6f in all retinal neurons, vasculature, and glia. In mice lacking RS1, we found that an array of novel phenotypes, which present around eye opening, are linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission and affect visual processing. These data identify a novel pathophysiology linked to RS1, and define a window where treatments might be best targeted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Transplantation of Astrocytic Mitochondria Modulates Neuronal Antioxidant Defense and Neuroplasticity and Promotes Functional Recovery after Intracerebral Hemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes release functional mitochondria (Mt) that play regulatory and prosurvival functions on entering adjacent cells. We recently demonstrated that these released Mts could enter microglia to promote their reparative/prophagocytic phenotype that assists in hematoma cleanup and neurological recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the relevance of astrocytic Mt transfer into neurons in protecting brain after ICH is unclear. Here, we found that ICH causes a robust increase in superoxide generation and elevated oxidative damage that coincides with loss of the mitochondrial enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). The damaging effect of ICH was reversed by intravenous transplantation of astrocytic Mt, which on entering the brain (and neurons), restored Mn-SOD levels and reduced neurological deficits in male mice subjected to ICH. Using an <I>in vitro</I> ICH-like injury model in cultured neurons, we established that astrocytic Mt on entering neurons prevented reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress and neuronal death by restoring neuronal Mn-SOD levels while at the same time promoted neurite extension and upregulation of synaptogenesis-related gene expression. Furthermore, we found that Mt genome-encoded small peptide humanin, which is normally abundant in Mt, could simulate Mt-transfer effect on neuronal Mn-SOD expression, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity under ICH-like injury. This study demonstrates that adoptive astrocytic Mt transfer enhances neuronal Mn-SOD-mediated antioxidative defense and neuroplasticity in the brain, which potentiate functional recovery following ICH.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mitochondrial dysfunction and antioxidant defense play essential roles in brain damage after ICH. Astrocytes release functional Mt that enters adjacent cells to help brain homeostatic function. Here, we show that systemic transplantation of astrocytic Mt restores ICH-impaired neuronal antioxidative defense, enhances neurite outgrowth, and improves stroke recovery after ICH. Our study suggests that systemic transplantation of astrocytic Mt could be considered as a novel and potentially promising strategy for ICH treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Alterations in Astrocytic Regulation of Excitation and Inhibition by Stress Exposure and in Severe Psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory signaling is commonly observed in major psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, and is often targeted by psychological and pharmacological treatment methods. The balance of excitation and inhibition is highly sensitive to severe psychological stress, one of the strongest risk factors for psychiatric disorders. The role of astrocytes in regulating excitatory and inhibitory signaling is now widely recognized; however, the specific involvement of astrocytes in the context of psychiatric disorders with a history of significant stress exposure remains unclear. In this review, we summarize how astrocytes regulate the balance of excitation and inhibition in the context of stress exposure and severe psychopathology, with a focus on the PFC, a brain area highly implicated in psychopathology. We first focus on preclinical models to demonstrate that the duration of stress (particularly acute vs chronic stress) is key to shaping astrocyte function and downstream behavior. We then provide a hypothesis for how astrocytes are involved in stress-associated cortical signaling imbalance, discuss how this directly contributes to phenotypes of psychopathologies, and provide suggestions for future research. We highlight that astrocytes are a key target to understand and treat the dysregulation of cortical signaling associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">c-Kit Receptor Maintains Sensory Axon Innervation of the Skin through Src Family Kinases</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral somatosensory neurons innervate the skin and sense the environment. Whereas many studies focus on initial axon outgrowth and pathfinding, how signaling pathways contribute to maintenance of the established axon arbors and terminals within the skin is largely unknown. This question is particularly relevant to the many types of neuropathies that affect mature neuronal arbors. We show that a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), c-Kit, contributes to maintenance, but not initial development, of cutaneous axons in the larval zebrafish before sex determination. Downregulation of Kit signaling rapidly induced retraction of established axon terminals in the skin and a reduction in axonal density. Conversely, misexpression of c-Kit ligand in the skin in larval zebrafish induced increases in local sensory axon density, suggesting an important role for Kit signaling in cutaneous axon maintenance. We found Src family kinases (SFKs) act directly downstream to mediate Kit's role in regulating cutaneous axon density. Our data demonstrate a requirement for skin-to-axon signaling to maintain axonal networks and elucidate novel roles for Kit and SFK signaling in this context. This Kit-SFK signaling axis offers a potential pathway to therapeutically target in sensory neuropathies and to further explore in other neurobiological processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The skin is full of small nerve endings that sense different environmental stimuli. How these nerve endings grow and reach a specific area of the skin during development has been the focus of many studies. In contrast, the cellular and molecular mechanisms required to maintain the function and health of these structures is relatively unknown. We discovered that a specific receptor in sensory neurons, c-Kit, is required to maintain the density of nerve endings in the skin. Furthermore, we found that a molecular target of c-Kit, Src family kinases (SFKs), is necessary for this role. Thus, c-Kit/SFK signaling regulates density and maintenance of sensory nerve endings in the skin and may have important roles in neural disease and regeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Glia Clocks in the Regulation of Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                <p>In <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, the pacemaker located in the brain plays the main role in maintaining circadian rhythms; however, peripheral oscillators including glial cells, are also crucial components of the circadian network. In the present study, we investigated an impact of oscillators located in astrocyte-like glia, the chiasm giant glia of the optic lobe, epithelial and subperineurial glia on sleep of <I>Drosophila</I> males. We described that oscillators located in astrocyte-like glia and chiasm giant glia are necessary to maintain daily changes in clock neurons arborizations, while those located in epithelial glia regulate amplitude of these changes. Finally, we showed that communication between glia and neurons through tripartite synapses formed by epithelial glia and, in effect, neurotransmission regulation plays important role in wake-promoting during the day.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian clock or pacemaker regulates many aspects of animals' physiology and behavior. The pacemaker is located in the brain and is composed of neurons. However, there are also additional oscillators, called peripheral clocks, which synchronize the main clock. Despite the critical role of glia in the clock machinery, little is known which type of glia houses peripheral oscillators and how they affect neuronal clocks. This study using <I>Drosophila</I> shows that oscillators in specific glia types maintain awakeness during the day by regulating the daily plasticity of clock neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rewiring Cortico-Muscular Control in the Healthy and Poststroke Human Brain with Proprioceptive {beta}-Band Neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                <p>In severely affected stroke survivors, cortico-muscular control is disturbed and volitional upper limb movements often absent. Mental rehearsal of the impaired movement in conjunction with sensory feedback provision are suggested as promising rehabilitation exercises. Knowledge about the underlying neural processes, however, remains vague. In male and female chronic stroke patients with hand paralysis, a brain-computer interface controlled a robotic orthosis and turned sensorimotor &beta;-band desynchronization during motor imagery (MI) of finger extension into contingent hand opening. Healthy control subjects performed the same task and received the same proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis or visual feedback only. Only when proprioceptive feedback was provided, cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) increased with a predominant information flow from the sensorimotor cortex to the finger extensors. This effect (1) was specific to the &beta; frequency band, (2) transferred to a motor task (MT), (3) was proportional to subsequent corticospinal excitability (CSE) and correlated with behavioral changes in the (4) healthy and (5) poststroke condition; notably, MI-related enhancement of &beta;-band CMC in the ipsilesional premotor cortex correlated with motor improvements after the intervention. In the healthy and injured human nervous system, synchronized activation of motor-related cortical and spinal neural pools facilitates, in accordance with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, cortico-spinal communication and may, thereby, be therapeutically relevant for functional restoration after stroke, when voluntary movements are no longer possible.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides insights into the neural processes that transfer effects of brain-computer interface neurofeedback to subsequent motor behavior. Specifically, volitional control of cortical oscillations and proprioceptive feedback enhances both cortical activity and behaviorally relevant connectivity to the periphery in a topographically circumscribed and frequency-specific way. This enhanced cortico-muscular control can be induced in the healthy and poststroke brain. Thereby, activating the motor cortex with mental rehearsal of the impaired movement and closing the loop by robot-assisted feedback synchronizes ipsilesional premotor cortex and spinal neural pools in the &beta; frequency band. This facilitates, in accordance with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis, cortico-spinal communication and may, thereby, be therapeutically relevant for functional restoration after stroke, when voluntary movements are no longer possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extraglomerular Excitation of Rat Olfactory Bulb Mitral Cells by Depolarizing GABAergic Synaptic Input</a></h4>

              
                <p>Principal cells in the olfactory bulb (OB), mitral and tufted cells, receive direct sensory input and generate output signals that are transmitted to downstream cortical targets. Excitatory input from glutamatergic receptor neurons are the primary known sources of rapid excitation to OB principal cells. Principal cells also receive inhibitory input from local GABAergic interneurons in both the glomerular and plexiform layers. Previous work suggests that the functional effect of these inhibitory inputs, including numerous dendrodendritic synapses with GABAergic granule cells, is to reduce firing probability. In this study, we use <I>in vitro</I> patch-clamp recordings to demonstrate that rat (of both sexes) OB mitral cells also can be excited by GABAergic synapses formed outside the glomerular layer. Depolarizing GABAergic responses to focal extracellular stimulation were revealed when fast ionotropic glutamate receptors were blocked, and occurred with short, monosynaptic latencies. These novel synaptic responses were abolished by gabazine, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, three structurally dissimilar GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonists. The likely location of depolarizing GABAergic input to mitral cells was the proximal axon based on the actions of focally applied gabazine and GABA near this region. Excitatory GABAergic synaptic responses, commonly studied in cortical brain regions, have not been reported previously in OB principal cells. Excitatory GABAergic responses promote action potential firing and provide a mechanism for mitral cells to be excited independently of olfactory sensory input.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Odor stimuli generate distinctive activity patterns in olfactory bulb neurons through a combination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions. Most of the excitatory drive to each principal cell is assumed to arise from a highly restricted subset of sensory neurons. This study describes a novel second source of synaptic excitation to principal cells to arise from GABAergic inputs to the proximal axon, a common site of action potential initiation. This new pathway provides a synaptic mechanism to excite OB principal cells that is independent of the canonical excitatory sensory input contained in the glomerular layer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex and Basolateral Amygdala Regulate Sensitivity to Delayed Punishment during Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In real-world decision-making scenarios, negative consequences do not always occur immediately after a choice. This delay between action and outcome drives the underestimation, or "delay discounting," of punishment. While the neural substrates underlying sensitivity to immediate punishment have been well-studied, there has been minimal investigation of delayed consequences. Here, we assessed the role of lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), two regions implicated in cost/benefit decision-making, in sensitivity to delayed versus immediate punishment. The delayed punishment decision-making task (DPDT) was used to measure delay discounting of punishment in rodents. During DPDT, rats choose between a small, single-pellet reward and a large, three-pellet reward accompanied by a mild foot shock. As the task progresses, the shock is preceded by a delay that systematically increases or decreases throughout the session. We observed that rats avoid choices associated with immediate punishment, then shift preference toward these options when punishment is delayed. LOFC inactivation did not influence choice of rewards with immediate punishment, but decreased choice of delayed punishment. We also observed that BLA inactivation reduced choice of delayed punishment for ascending but not descending delays. Inactivation of either brain region produced comparable effects on decision-making in males and females, but there were sex differences observed in omissions and latency to make a choice. In summary, both LOFC and BLA contribute to the delay discounting of punishment and may serve as promising therapeutic targets to improve sensitivity to delayed punishment during decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Recurring Cholinergic Inputs Induce Local Hippocampal Plasticity through Feedforward Disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The CA1 pyramidal neurons are embedded in an intricate local circuitry that contains a variety of interneurons. The roles these interneurons play in the regulation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity remains largely understudied. Recent experiments showed that recurring cholinergic activation of &alpha;7 nACh receptors expressed in oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM&alpha;2) interneurons can directly induce LTP in Schaffer collateral (SC)&ndash;CA1 synapses. Here, we pair <I>in vitro</I> studies with biophysically based modeling to uncover the underlying mechanisms. According to our model, &alpha;7 nAChR activation increases OLM GABAergic activity. This results in the inhibition of the fast-spiking interneurons that provide feedforward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. This disinhibition, paired with tightly timed SC stimulation, can induce potentiation at the excitatory synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our work details the role of cholinergic modulation in disinhibition-induced hippocampal plasticity. It relates the timing of cholinergic pairing found experimentally in previous studies with the timing between disinhibition and hippocampal stimulation necessary to induce potentiation and suggests the dynamics of the involved interneurons plays a crucial role in determining this timing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A methylbenzimidazole derivative regulates mammalian circadian rhythms by targeting Cryptochrome proteins [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impairment of the circadian clock has been associated with numerous diseases, including sleep disorders and metabolic disease. Although small-molecules that modulate clock function may form the basis of drug discovery of clock-related diseases, only a few compounds that selectively target core clock proteins have been identified. Three scaffolds were previously discovered as small-molecule activators of the clock protein Cryptochrome (CRY), and they have been providing powerful tools to understand and control the circadian clock system. Identifying new scaffolds will expand the possibilities of drug discovery. Methods: A methylbenzimidazole derivative TH401 identified from cell-based circadian screens was characterized. Effects of TH401 on circadian rhythms were evaluated in cellular assays. Functional assays and X-ray crystallography were used to elucidate the effects of the compound on CRY1 and CRY2 isoforms. Results: TH401 lengthened the period of circadian rhythms and stabilized both CRY1 and CRY2. The compound repressed Per2 reporter activity, which was reduced by Cry1 or Cry2 knockout and abolished by Cry1/Cry2 double knockout, indicating the dependence on CRY isoforms. Thermal shift assays showed slightly higher interaction of TH401 with CRY2 over CRY1. The crystal structure of CRY1 in complex with TH401 revealed a conformational change of the gatekeeper W399, which is involved in isoform-selectivity determination. Conclusions: The present study identified a new small-molecule TH401 that targets both CRY isoforms. This compound has expanded the chemical diversity of CRY activators, and will ultimately aid in the development of therapeutics against circadian clock-related disorders.

                Background: Vemurafenib (VEM) was a licensed drug for the treatment of skin melanoma and is available only in the market as oral tablets prescribed in huge doses (1920 mg/day). One reason for the high dose is vemurafenib's low oral bioavailability. Methods: VEM-lipid complex (DLC) was predicted based on Conquest and Mercury programs and prepared using the solvent evaporation method using the lipid (phosphatidylethanolamine). DLC was subjected to characterization (FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, DSC, TGA, P-XRD, and FESEM) to confirm complexation.  DLC was used to prepare solid in oil nanodispersion (DLC-SON) and subjected to in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evaluation in comparison to our recently prepared conventional SON (VEM-SON) and DLC-control. Results: Conquest and Mercury predict the availability of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between VEM and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). All characterization tests of DLC ensure the complexation of the drug with PE. Ex vivo studies showed that the drug in DLC-SON has significantly (P<0.05) higher skin permeation than DLC-control but lower drug permeation than conventional SON but it has a higher % skin deposition (P<0.05) than others. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the prepared DLC-SON is significantly high (P<0.05) in comparison to the conventional SON and pure VEM. In vivo permeation using confocal laser scanning microscopy (on the rat) results indicated that both conventional SON and DLC-SON can cross the SC and infiltrate the dermis and epidermis but DLC-SON has a higher luminance/gray value after 24 h in the dermis in comparison to the conventional SON. Conclusion: The novel lipid complex for VEM prepared using PE as a lipid and enclosed in SON showed higher anticancer activity and topical permeation as well as sustained delivery and good retention time in the dermis that localize the drug in a sufficient concentration to eliminate early diagnosed skin melanoma.

In the present study, we report changes in cerebral glucose metabolism in a unique meditation practice augmented by clitoral stimulation called, Orgasmic Meditation, in which a spiritual state is described to be attained by both male and female participants engaged in the practice as a pair. Methods: Male (N=20) and female (N=20) subjects had an intravenous catheter connected to a bag of normal saline inserted prior to the practice. During the practice, men stimulated their partner’s clitoris for exactly 15 minutes (he received no sexual stimulation). Midway through the practice, researchers injected 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose so the scan would reflect cerebral metabolism during the practice. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed approximately 30 minutes later. Results: In the female participants, the meditation state showed significant decreases in the left inferior frontal, inferior parietal, insula, middle temporal, and orbitofrontal regions as well as in the right angular gyrus, anterior cingulate and parahippocampus compared to a neutral state (p<0.01). Male subjects had significant decreases in the left middle frontal, paracentral, precentral, and postcentral regions as well as the right middle frontal and paracentral regions during meditation (p<0.01). Men also had significantly increased metabolism in the cerebellum and right postcentral and superior temporal regions (p<0.01). Conclusions: These findings represent a distinct pattern of brain activity, for both men and women, that is a hybrid between that of other meditation practices and sexual stimulation. Such findings have potential psychotherapeutic implications and may deepen our understanding of the relationship between spiritual and sexual experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of neutral honey as a tissue fixative in histopathology [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In routine histopathology, 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) is the choice fixative. However, formalin is a human carcinogen, so there is a necessity for a safer alternative. To the best of our knowledge, neutral honey, not natural or artificial honey, has not been tested to fix histological samples. This study determined the effectiveness of neutral buffered honey and other types of fixatives to fix histological tissues. Methods: The study was conducted between July 2019 and August 2020 at Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. Sections from three rat livers, kidneys, and stomach tissues were fixed with 10% NBF, neutral buffered Sumer honey, neutral buffered date honey, formalin, Sumer honey, date honey, alcoholic formalin, alcoholic Sumer honey, and alcoholic date honey for 24 hours. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), special stains, and vimentin methods. Three expert biomedical scientists then evaluated the fixed and stained samples for the quality of all sections. The fixation ability of the different honey solutions was then compared to 10% NBF and the utility was determined using nuclear and cytoplasmic criteria, specificity, and intensity. Results: H&E showed adequate staining in all groups compared to 10% NBF. The specificity and intensity of all groups for the Periodic acid–Schiff method were identical to 10% NBF except for Sumer honey and alcoholic date honey. Vimentin showed comparable findings with 10% NBF as there were no significant differences. Conclusions: The findings of this study encourage the use of honey, including neutral, as a possible safe substitute fixative for formalin, however, further experiments on larger specimens should be conducted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cortical auditory potentials and cognitive potentials in individuals with and without vestibular dysfunction [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Among individuals with vestibular dysfunction, the loss of vestibular sensory information is found to alter cognitive abilities that coordinate spatial and non-spatial information. P300 is an event-related potential commonly used to assess cognitive processing. The aim of the present study was to compare the latency and amplitude of cortical auditory evoked potential and P300 between individuals with vestibular dysfunction and individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. Methods: Forty adults with a mean age of 40.5 ± 13.07 participated in the study. Group I included 20 adults diagnosed with vestibular dysfunction and group II included 20 age-matched adults with no vestibular dysfunction. The P300 was recorded from the electrode site Cz and Pz. It was elicited using pure-tones in odd-ball paradigm. The latency and amplitude of peaks P1, N1, P2, and N2 of the cortical auditory evoked potential and the P300 were measured. Results: Significant amplitude difference was observed in cortical potentials at Cz and Pz. The P300 was present only in 70% of individuals with vestibular dysfunction compared to 100% among individuals with no vestibular dysfunction. The mean amplitude of the P300 was slightly larger in group 1 compared to group 2 and the mean latency of the P300 was similar in both groups. However, the difference in amplitude of the P300 between groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Knowing the cognitive function of individuals with vestibular dysfunction enables planning vestibular rehabilitation therapy, which enhances the quality of life in these individuals by improving their vestibular and cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of the protective effects of cyanocobalamin on methotrexate induced nephrotoxicity in rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic drug, used mainly in many cancerous stages, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, but its use has been limited by its nephrotoxicity. Cyanocobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin possessing nephro-protective properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cyanocobalamin on the nephrotoxicity of methotrexate. Methods: In the study 42 albino adult female rats were used, divided into six groups each containing seven rats (n=7). 1st group: Control group (Negative control), 7 rats were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5ml/kg/day NS. Second group: 7 rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of methotrexate (20 mg/kg) for 4 days. Third Group: 7 rats were given intraperitoneally cyanocobalamin at a dose (1.5 mg/kg/day) for two weeks, fourth, fifth, sixth group: 7 rats from each group were injected intraperitoneally with different concentrations of cyanocobalamin (0.5, 1, 1.5 mg/kg /day), respectively, for two weeks and MTX (20 mg/kg), which was injected only on day 11. On day 15, rats from all groups were euthanized, and blood samples were taken for biochemical tests, including evaluating serum urea and creatinine. The kidneys were extracted for histological investigation and evaluation of antioxidant (GSH) and oxidative stress (MDA) by using kidney tissue homogenates. Results: This study revealed that kidney damage, produced by the MTX (group II), is manifested by significantly elevated (P<0.05) urea and creatinine. On the contrary, the cyanocobalamin groups (IV, V, VI) significantly (P<0.05) reduced urea and creatinine. Renal antioxidant defense systems, such as reduced glutathione depleted by MTX therapy, were restored to normal levels by cyanocobalamin. Furthermore, cyanocobalamin reduced oxidative stress (MDA) and histologically reduced renal tissue injury induced by MTX. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study revealed that cyanocobalamin has a nephroprotective action upon MTX-induced renal damage in rats; cyanocobalamin may offer a protective effect, such as antioxidant action.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild-type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blockers for the treatment of prostate cancer [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The potential utility of an augmented data collection approach in understanding the journey to care of pregnant women for maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across all 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

                Background: This is a cross-sectional study to further understand the effects of axial length elongation on the corneal endothelial cell’s morphology in myopic children. Abnormal changes in the morphology of corneal endothelium are indicators of corneal stress or instability which could be linked to myopia. Methods: 111 school children comprising of 37 emmetropes, 37 mild myopes and 37 moderate myopes aged 8-9 years old were recruited. Visual acuity was measured using the LogMar chart, cycloplegic refraction was determined using an open-field autorefractor (Grand Seiko WAM-5100, Hiroshima, Japan) and refined using subjective refraction. Morphology of corneal endothelial cells [endothelial cell density, coefficient of variation, hexagonality and central corneal thickness] was evaluated using a non-contact specular microscope (Topcon SP-2000P). Axial length was measured with A-scan ultrasound biometry (PacScan Plus, Sonomed Escalon, NY). The correlation between morphology of corneal endothelial cells and axial length were assessed using Pearson Correlation and Linear regression analysis. Results: There was no significant difference in corneal endothelial cells and axial length between gender (p>0.05). Significant reduction in endothelial cells density and hexagonality and increased coefficient of variation was found in eyes of higher myopic power which had longer axial when compared to emmetropes (p<0.001). Except for central corneal thickness, all corneal endothelial cells parameters correlated significantly with axial length (p<0.05). For every 1mm increase in axial length, endothelial cells density decreased by 73.27cells/mm2, hexagonality decreased by 2.32% and coefficient of variation increased by 1.75%. Conclusions: There were significant changes in morphology of cornea endothelial cells in young moderate myopic children of Chinese ethnicity at 8-9 years of age. This result provides normative data for Malaysian children of Chinese ethnicity that can be used for comparison and reference for clinical procedures, thereby facilitating decision-making with respect to interventions for myopia control, especially in prescribing contact lens for children.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus spatial view neurons in primates respond to the spatial location being looked at. The representation is allocentric, in that the responses are to locations “out there” in the world, and are relatively invariant with respect to retinal position, eye position, head direction, and the place where the individual is located. The underlying connectivity in humans is from ventromedial visual cortical regions to the parahippocampal scene area, leading to the theory that spatial view cells are formed by combinations of overlapping feature inputs self-organized based on their closeness in space. Thus, although spatial view cells represent “where” for episodic memory and navigation, they are formed by ventral visual stream feature inputs in the parahippocampal gyrus in what is the parahippocampal scene area. A second “where” driver of spatial view cells are parietal inputs, which it is proposed provide the idiothetic update for spatial view cells, used for memory recall and navigation when the spatial view details are obscured. Inferior temporal object “what” inputs and orbitofrontal cortex reward inputs connect to the human hippocampal system, and in macaques can be associated in the hippocampus with spatial view cell “where” representations to implement episodic memory. Hippocampal spatial view cells also provide a basis for navigation to a series of viewed landmarks, with the orbitofrontal cortex reward inputs to the hippocampus providing the goals for navigation, which can then be implemented by hippocampal connectivity in humans to parietal cortex regions involved in visuomotor actions in space. The presence of foveate vision and the highly developed temporal lobe for object and scene processing in primates including humans provide a basis for hippocampal spatial view cells to be key to understanding episodic memory in the primate and human hippocampus, and the roles of this system in primate including human navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HLA class I and discoveries of the HLA-K (pseudogene) related to disease severity and progression in patients with spondyloarthritis in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, a tertiary health care center in Surabaya, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting pe</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by enthesitis, sacroiliitis, and axial joint involvement. Although the association of HLA with SpA has been widely reported, there have been no studies of HLA type in the Indonesian population within the last 20 years. This study aims to identify the HLA type in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Indonesia. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional analytical design with samples that met the criteria for SpA according to the 2009 ASAS. The clinical scores used in this study were mSASSS, BASFI, ASDAS, and Schober. Genetic identification using PCR was performed followed by sanger sequencing to determine the HLA type in the patient. DNA sequences were aligned with BLAST, and a phylogenetic tree was created using MEGA 11. Descriptive and comparative analyzes were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Results: This study founded four types of HLA in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, that is HLA-B with six alleles; -B*2704 (12.86%), -B*2705 (1.43%), -B*2706 (1.43%), -B*1802 (4.28%), -B*57v (1.43%), -B*35 (2.86%), HLA - C (21.43%), and HLA - K (52.83%). Clinical scoring of HLA-C and HLA-K indicated severe and progressive disease activity. The HLA-K had the highest mSASSS (26, 95% CI: 22–28), while HLA-C had the highest BASFI score (60, 95% CI: 55–68), the lowest Schober score (12, 95% CI: 10–14), and the shortest duration of illness (22, 95% CI: 12–36). There is no significant difference in the ASDAS score among types. Conclusions: The most common HLA types found in SpA patients at Dr. Soetomo were HLA-C and HLA-K, with the most progressive disease activity indicated by poor mSASSS, BASFI, ASDAS, and Schober scores with a short duration of illness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Us versus them mentality in football fans: Significant social defeat engages the mentalization network and disengages cognitive control areas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social affiliation is one of the building blocks that shapes cultures and communities. This motivation contributes to the development of social bonding among individuals within a group, enjoying rights, assuming obligations, and strengthening its identity. Evidence has shown that social affiliation has inspired different social phenomena, such as wars, political movements, social struggles, among others, based on two human motivations: the ingroup love and the outgroup hate. One contemporary group to study as a proxy of social affiliation, and ingroup and outgroup motivations is the sports competition. However, this affiliation model has been poorly considered in social neuroscience research. This research aimed to shed light on the neurobiological networks that are related to social affiliation in football fans of two of the most popular Chilean football teams. Methods: To this end, 43 male fans of two football rival teams watched videos of winning and losing goals of their favorite team while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: The results showed that while the activation of the reward system was observed in fans when their team scores goals against the rival, both the activation of the mentalization network and the inhibition of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex were associated with the emotional correlates of defeat in football fans. Conclusions: Taking these findings together could contribute to a deeper understanding of social affiliation, and more importantly, of extreme affiliation phenomena, and fanaticism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identifying enhancer properties associated with genetic risk for complex traits using regulome-wide association studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex M. Casella, Carlo Colantuoni, Seth A. Ament</p>

Genetic risk for complex traits is strongly enriched in non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation, especially enhancers. However, we lack adequate tools to connect the characteristics of these disruptions to genetic risk. Here, we propose RWAS (Regulome Wide Association Study), a new application of the MAGMA software package to identify the characteristics of enhancers that contribute to genetic risk for disease. RWAS involves three steps: (i) assign genotyped SNPs to cell type- or tissue-specific regulatory features (e.g., enhancers); (ii) test associations of each regulatory feature with a trait of interest for which genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics are available; (iii) perform enhancer-set enrichment analyses to identify quantitative or categorical features of regulatory elements that are associated with the trait. These steps are implemented as a novel application of MAGMA, a tool originally developed for gene-based GWAS analyses. Applying RWAS to interrogate genetic risk for schizophrenia, we discovered a class of risk-associated AT-rich enhancers that are active in the developing brain and harbor binding sites for multiple transcription factors with neurodevelopmental functions. RWAS utilizes open-source software, and we provide a comprehensive collection of annotations for tissue-specific enhancer locations and features, including their evolutionary conservation, AT content, and co-localization with binding sites for hundreds of TFs. RWAS will enable researchers to characterize properties of regulatory elements associated with any trait of interest for which GWAS summary statistics are available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A multi-label learning model for predicting drug-induced pathology in multi-organ based on toxicogenomics data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ran Su, Haitang Yang, Leyi Wei, Siqi Chen, Quan Zou</p>

Drug-induced toxicity damages the health and is one of the key factors causing drug withdrawal from the market. It is of great significance to identify drug-induced target-organ toxicity, especially the detailed pathological findings, which are crucial for toxicity assessment, in the early stage of drug development process. A large variety of studies have devoted to identify drug toxicity. However, most of them are limited to single organ or only binary toxicity. Here we proposed a novel multi-label learning model named Att-RethinkNet, for predicting drug-induced pathological findings targeted on liver and kidney based on toxicogenomics data. The Att-RethinkNet is equipped with a memory structure and can effectively use the label association information. Besides, attention mechanism is embedded to focus on the important features and obtain better feature presentation. Our Att-RethinkNet is applicable in multiple organs and takes account the compound type, dose, and administration time, so it is more comprehensive and generalized. And more importantly, it predicts multiple pathological findings at the same time, instead of predicting each pathology separately as the previous model did. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared the proposed method with a series of state-of-the-arts methods. Our model shows competitive performance and can predict potential hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a more accurate and reliable way. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/RanSuLab/Drug-Toxicity-Prediction-MultiLabel.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Copper binding leads to increased dynamics in the regulatory N-terminal domain of full-length human copper transporter ATP7B</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fredrik Orädd, Jonas Hyld Steffen, Pontus Gourdon, Magnus Andersson</p>

ATP7B is a human copper-transporting P<sub>1B</sub>-type ATPase that is involved in copper homeostasis and resistance to platinum drugs in cancer cells. ATP7B consists of a copper-transporting core and a regulatory N-terminal tail that contains six metal-binding domains (MBD1-6) connected by linker regions. The MBDs can bind copper, which changes the dynamics of the regulatory domain and activates the protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To identify possible copper-specific structural dynamics involved in transport regulation, we constructed a model of ATP7B spanning the N-terminal tail and core catalytic domains and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with (holo) and without (apo) copper ions bound to the MBDs. In the holo protein, MBD2, MBD3 and MBD5 showed enhanced mobilities, which resulted in a more extended N-terminal regulatory region. The observed separation of MBD2 and MBD3 from the core protein supports a mechanism where copper binding activates the ATP7B protein by reducing interactions among MBD1-3 and between MBD1-3 and the core protein. We also observed an increased interaction between MBD5 and the core protein that brought the copper-binding site of MBD5 closer to the high-affinity internal copper-binding site in the core protein. The simulation results assign specific, mechanistic roles to the metal-binding domains involved in ATP7B regulation that are testable in experimental settings.

Identifying the neural correlates of visual serial dependence has lagged behind the behavioral understanding. A new study in PLOS Biology provides a model of interpreting the complex relationship between physiology and behavior in studies of serial dependence.

Our senses are barraged with discontinuous and uncertain visual input, but the brain smooths experience by making perception serially dependent. Neural correlates of this have been elusive but this Primer explores a new PLOS Biology study that provides a model for interpreting the complex relationship between physiology and behavior in studies of serial dependence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The evolutionary conserved proteins CEP90, FOPNL, and OFD1 recruit centriolar distal appendage proteins to initiate their assembly</a></h4>

In metazoa, cilia assembly is a cellular process that starts with centriole to basal body maturation, migration to the cell surface, and docking to the plasma membrane. Basal body docking involves the interaction of both the distal end of the basal body and the transition fibers/distal appendages, with the plasma membrane. Mutations in numerous genes involved in basal body docking and transition zone assembly are associated with the most severe ciliopathies, highlighting the importance of these events in cilium biogenesis. In this context, the ciliate <i>Paramecium</i> has been widely used as a model system to study basal body and cilia assembly. However, despite the evolutionary conservation of cilia assembly events across phyla, whether the same molecular players are functionally conserved, is not fully known. Here, we demonstrated that CEP90, FOPNL, and OFD1 are evolutionary conserved proteins crucial for ciliogenesis. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we unveiled that these proteins localize at the distal end of both centrioles/basal bodies in <i>Paramecium</i> and mammalian cells. Moreover, we found that these proteins are recruited early during centriole duplication on the external surface of the procentriole. Functional analysis performed both in <i>Paramecium</i> and mammalian cells demonstrate the requirement of these proteins for distal appendage assembly and basal body docking. Finally, we show that mammalian centrioles require another component, Moonraker (MNR), to recruit OFD1, FOPNL, and CEP90, which will then recruit the distal appendage proteins CEP83, CEP89, and CEP164. Altogether, we propose that this OFD1, FOPNL, and CEP90 functional module is required to determine in mammalian cells the future position of distal appendage proteins.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is solid evidence for the prominent involvement of the central autonomic and default mode systems in shaping personality. However, whether functional connectivity of these systems can represent neural correlates and predictors of individual variation in personality traits is largely unknown. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 215 healthy young adults were used to construct the sympathetic (SN), parasympathetic (PN), and default mode (DMN) networks, with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity measured. Personality factors were assessed using the five-factor model. We examined the associations between personality factors and functional network connectivity, followed by performance of personality prediction based on functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a recently developed machine learning approach. All personality factors (neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) other than openness were significantly correlated with intra- and internetwork functional connectivity of the SN, PN, and DMN. Moreover, the CPM models successfully predicted conscientiousness and agreeableness at the individual level using functional network connectivity. Our findings may expand existing knowledge regarding the neural substrates underlying personality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in nursing homes – the experience of care workers in Poland [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nursing homes in Poland are the most common formal care institutions for dependent people. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nursing homes had particularly high infection rates. In this context, it is important to ask about the experiences of the care workers working in these institutions. Methods: This research was conducted using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) technique in five provinces in Poland. The field research was carried out in April 2021. The research sample included, among others, nurses, care workers, therapists, social workers and the management staff of institutions whose representatives worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked to assess the care provided to residents. Results: It turned out that the vast majority of respondents positively assessed the fulfillment of the basic living needs of residents and the availability of care. The assessment of the organization of residents’ leisure time, the fulfillment of their religious and cultural needs, and the issue of maintaining contacts with the social environment was less satisfactory. The article also describes the results of care institution employees’ self-assessment of their mental health. For the majority, the most stressful factor was the need to work in a health-threatening environment and the sense of responsibility for the residents. Regarding the availability of the forms of support offered to workers experiencing deteriorating mental health due to working in the pandemic situation, more than a third said that their institution did not offer any form of assistance. Conclusions: The article lists a number of recommendations. In the light of the data obtained, it is necessary to increase the intensity of services provided to residents of nursing homes in terms of organizing their free time, meeting their religious and cultural needs and maintaining contact with the social environment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Workflow Times and Outcomes in Patients Triaged for a Suspected Severe Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Current recommendations for regional stroke destination suggest that patients with severe acute stroke in non-urban areas should be triaged based on the estimated transport time to a referral thrombectomy-capable center.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the association of pre-hospital workflow times with neurological outcomes in patients included in the RACECAT trial. Workflow times evaluated were known or could be estimated before transport allocation. Primary outcome was the shift analysis on the modified Rankin score at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 1,369 patients included, the median time from onset to emergency medical service (EMS) evaluation, the estimated transport time to a thrombectomy-capable center and local stroke center, and the estimated transfer time between centers were 65 minutes (interquartile ratio [IQR] = 43–138), 61 minutes (IQR = 36–80), 17 minutes (IQR = 9–27), and 62 minutes (IQR = 36–73), respectively. Longer time intervals from stroke onset to EMS evaluation were associated with higher odds of disability at 90 days in the local stroke center group (adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for each 30-minute increment = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.06), with no association in the thrombectomy-capable center group (acOR for each 30-minute increment = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.98–1.01, <i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.021). No significant interaction was found for other pre-hospital workflow times. In patients evaluated by EMS later than 120 minutes after stroke onset, direct transport to a thrombectomy-capable center was associated with better disability outcomes (acOR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.03–2.17).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We found a significant heterogeneity in the association between initial transport destination and neurological outcomes according to the elapse of time between the stroke onset and the EMS evaluation (<a target="_blank"

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Dystrophinopathy Phenotypes and Modifying Factors in DMD Exon 45–55 Deletion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon 45–55 deletion (del45–55) has been postulated as a model that could treat up to 60% of DMD patients, but the associated clinical variability and complications require clarification. We aimed to understand the phenotypes and potential modifying factors of this dystrophinopathy subset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study applied clinical and functional evaluation. Next generation sequencing was employed to identify intronic breakpoints and their impact on the <i>Dp140</i> promotor, intronic long noncoding RNA, and regulatory splicing sequences. DMD modifiers (<i>SPP1, LTBP4, ACTN3</i>) and concomitant mutations were also assessed. Haplotypes were built using <i>DMD</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms. Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of &gt;67% and traces of alternative del45–57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the <i>LTBP4</i> haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We confirmed that del45–55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the <i>LTBP4</i> modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

                The respiratory tract is a compartmentalised and heterogenous environment. The nasopharynx and sinuses of the upper airways have distinct properties from the lungs and these differences may shape bacterial adaptation and evolution. Upper airway niches act as early colonisation sites for respiratory bacterial pathogens, including those, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that can go on to establish chronic infection of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the importance of upper airway environments in facilitating early adaptation to host environments, currently available in vitro models for study of respiratory infection in CF focus exclusively on the lungs. Furthermore, animal models, widely used to bridge the gap between in vitro systems and the clinical scenario, do not allow the upper and lower airways to be studied in isolation. We have developed a suite of culture media reproducing key features of the upper and lower airways, for the study of bacterial adaptation and evolution in different respiratory environments. For both upper and lower airway-mimicking media, we have developed formulations that reflect airway conditions in health and those that reflect the altered environment of the CF respiratory tract. Here, we describe the development and validation of these media and their use for study of genetic and phenotypic adaptations in P. aeruginosa during growth under upper or lower airway conditions in health and in CF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetically manipulating endogenous Kras levels and oncogenic mutations in vivo influences tissue patterning of murine tumorigenesis</a></h4>

              
                Despite multiple possible oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene <i>KRAS</i>, unique subsets of these mutations are detected in different cancer types. As <i>KRAS</i> mutations occur early, if not being the initiating event, these mutational biases are ostensibly a product of how normal cells respond to the encoded oncoprotein. Oncogenic mutations can impact not only the level of active oncoprotein, but also engagement with proteins. To attempt to separate these two effects, we generated four novel Cre-inducible (LSL) <i>Kras</i> alleles in mice with the biochemically distinct G12D or Q61R mutations and encoded by native (nat) rare or common (com) codons to produce low or high protein levels. While there were similarities, each allele also induced a distinct transcriptional response shortly after activation in vivo. At one end of the spectrum, activating the <i>Kras</i><sup><i>LSL-</i>natG12D</sup> allele induced transcriptional hallmarks suggestive of an expansion of multipotent cells, while at the other end, activating the <i>Kras</i><sup><i>LSL-</i>comQ61R</sup> allele led to hallmarks of hyperproliferation and oncogenic stress. Evidence suggests that these changes may be a product of signaling differences due to increased protein expression as well as the specific mutation. To determine the impact of these distinct responses on RAS mutational patterning in vivo, all four alleles were globally activated, revealing that hematolymphopoietic lesions were permissive to the level of active oncoprotein, squamous tumors were permissive to the G12D mutant, while carcinomas were permissive to both these features. We suggest that different KRAS mutations impart unique signaling properties that are preferentially capable of inducing tumor initiation in a distinct cell-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impact of blindness onset on the representation of sound categories in occipital and temporal cortices</a></h4>

              
                The ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) reliably encodes auditory categories in people born blind using a representational structure partially similar to the one found in vision (Mattioni et al.,2020). Here, using a combination of uni- and multivoxel analyses applied to fMRI data, we extend our previous findings, comprehensively investigating how early and late acquired blindness impact on the cortical regions coding for the deprived and the remaining senses. First, we show enhanced univariate response to sounds in part of the occipital cortex of both blind groups that is concomitant to reduced auditory responses in temporal regions. We then reveal that the representation of the sound categories in the occipital and temporal regions is more similar in blind subjects compared to sighted subjects. What could drive this enhanced similarity? The multivoxel encoding of the ‘human voice’ category that we observed in the temporal cortex of all sighted and blind groups is enhanced in occipital regions in blind groups , suggesting that the representation of vocal information is more similar between the occipital and temporal regions in blind compared to sighted individuals. We additionally show that blindness does not affect the encoding of the acoustic properties of our sounds (e.g. pitch, harmonicity) in occipital and in temporal regions but instead selectively alter the categorical coding of the voice category itself. These results suggest a functionally congruent interplay between the reorganization of occipital and temporal regions following visual deprivation, across the lifespan.

                Dietary lipids (DLs), particularly sterols and fatty acids, are precursors for endogenous lipids that, unusually for macronutrients, shape cellular and organismal function long after ingestion. These functions – cell membrane structure, intracellular signalling, and hormonal activity – vary with the identity of DLs, and scale up to influence health, survival, and reproductive fitness, thereby affecting evolutionary change. Our Ecological Lipidology approach integrates biochemical mechanisms and molecular cell biology into evolution and nutritional ecology. It exposes our need to understand environmental impacts on lipidomes, the lipid specificity of cell functions, and predicts the evolution of lipid-based diet choices. Broad interdisciplinary implications of Ecological Lipidology include food web alterations, species responses to environmental change, as well as sex differences and lifestyle impacts on human nutrition, and opportunities for DL-based therapies.

                The scaffold protein PSD-95 links postsynaptic receptors to sites of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Flexible linkers between folded domains in PSD-95 enable a dynamic supertertiary structure. Interdomain interactions within the PSG supramodule, formed by PDZ3, SH3 and Guanylate Kinase domains, regulate PSD-95 activity. Here we combined Discrete Molecular Dynamics and single molecule FRET to characterize the PSG supramodule, with time resolution spanning picoseconds to seconds. We used a FRET network to measure distances in full-length PSD-95 and model the conformational ensemble. We found that PDZ3 samples two conformational basins, which we confirmed with disulfide mapping. To understand effects on activity, we measured binding of the synaptic adhesion protein neuroligin. We found that PSD-95 bound neuroligin well at physiological pH while truncated PDZ3 bound poorly. Our hybrid structural models reveal how the supertertiary context of PDZ3 enables recognition of this critical synaptic ligand.

                Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) provides a major source of genetic variation. Many viruses, including poxviruses, encode genes with crucial functions directly gained by gene transfer from hosts. The mechanism of transfer to poxvirus genomes is unknown. Using genome analysis and experimental screens of infected cells, we discovered a central role for Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposition in HGT to virus genomes. The process recapitulates processed pseudogene generation, but with host messenger RNA directed into virus genomes. Intriguingly, hallmark features of retrotransposition appear to favor virus adaption through rapid duplication of captured host genes on arrival. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized conduit of genetic traffic with fundamental implications for the evolution of many virus classes and their hosts.

                Brassinosteroids (BR) are key hormonal regulators of plant development. However, whereas the individual components of BR perception and signaling are well characterized experimentally, the question of how they can act and whether they are sufficient to carry out the critical function of cellular elongation remains open. Here, we combined computational modeling with quantitative cell physiology to understand the dynamics of the plasma membrane (PM)-localized BR response pathway during the initiation of cellular responses in the epidermis of the Arabidopsis root tip that are be linked to cell elongation. The model, consisting of ordinary differential equations, comprises the BR induced hyperpolarization of the PM, the acidification of the apoplast and subsequent cell wall swelling. We demonstrate that the competence of the root epidermal cells for the BR response predominantly depends on the amount and activity of H+-ATPases in the PM. The model further predicts that an influx of cations is required to compensate for the shift of positive charges caused by the apoplastic acidification. A potassium channel was subsequently identified and experimentally characterized, fulfilling this function. Thus, we established the landscape of components and parameters for physiological processes potentially linked to cell elongation, a central process in plant development.

From a micronutrient analysis, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is especially critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. As a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate facilitates TET2/3-mediated DNA modification and demethylation of multiple elements at the <i>Prdm1</i> locus. DNA demethylation augments STAT3 association at the <i>Prdm1</i> promoter and a downstream enhancer, thus ensuring efficient gene expression and plasma cell differentiation. The results suggest that an adequate level of ascorbate is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients may regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LINE-1 retrotransposons facilitate horizontal gene transfer into poxviruses</a></h4>

              
                There is ample phylogenetic evidence that many critical virus functions, like immune evasion, evolved by the acquisition of genes from their hosts through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, the lack of an experimental system has prevented a mechanistic understanding of this process. We developed a model to elucidate the mechanisms of HGT into vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus. All identified gene capture events showed signatures of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1)-mediated retrotransposition, including spliced-out introns, polyadenylated tails, and target site duplications. In one case, the acquired gene integrated together with a polyadenylated host U2 small nuclear RNA. Integrations occurred across the genome, in some cases knocking out essential viral genes. These essential gene knockouts were rescued through a process of complementation by the parent virus followed by non-homologous recombination during serial passaging to generate a single, replication-competent virus. This work links multiple evolutionary mechanisms into one adaptive cascade and identifies host retrotransposons as major drivers for virus evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Altered regulation of Ia afferent input during voluntary contraction in humans with spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input converging on the spinal cord contributes to the control of movement. Although sensory pathways reorganize following spinal cord injury (SCI), the extent to which sensory input from Ia afferents is regulated during voluntary contraction after the injury remains largely unknown. To address this question, the soleus H-reflex and conditioning of the H-reflex by stimulating homonymous [depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by common peroneal nerve (CPN) stimulation, D1 inhibition] and heteronymous (d), [monosynaptic Ia facilitation of the soleus H-reflex evoked by femoral nerve stimulation (FN facilitation)] nerves were tested at rest, and during tonic voluntary contraction in humans with and without chronic incomplete SCI. The soleus H-reflex size increased in both groups during voluntary contraction compared with rest, but to a lesser extent in SCI participants. Compared with rest, the D1 inhibition decreased during voluntary contraction in controls but it was still present in SCI participants. Further, the FN facilitation increased in controls but remained unchanged in SCI participants during voluntary contraction compared with rest. Changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation were correlated with changes in the H-reflex during voluntary contraction, suggesting an association between outcomes. These findings provide the first demonstration that the regulation of Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves is altered during voluntary contraction in humans with SCI, resulting in lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Highly efficient generation of isogenic pluripotent stem cell models using prime editing</a></h4>

              
                The recent development of prime editing (PE) genome engineering technologies has the potential to significantly simplify the generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based disease models. PE is a multi-component editing system that uses a Cas9-nickase fused to a reverse transcriptase (nCas9-RT) and an extended PE guide RNA (pegRNA). Once reverse transcribed, the pegRNA extension functions as a repair template to introduce precise designer mutations at the target site. Here, we systematically compared the editing efficiencies of PE to conventional gene editing methods in hPSCs. This analysis revealed that PE is overall more efficient and precise than homology-directed repair (HDR) of site-specific nuclease-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Specifically, PE is more effective in generating heterozygous editing events to create autosomal dominant disease-associated mutations. By stably integrating the nCas9-RT into hPSCs we achieved editing efficiencies equal to those reported for cancer cells, suggesting that the expression of the PE components, rather than cell-intrinsic features, limit PE in hPSCs. To improve the efficiency of PE in hPSCs, we optimized the delivery modalities for the PE components. Delivery of the nCas9-RT as mRNA combined with synthetically generated, chemically-modified pegRNAs and nicking guide RNAs (ngRNAs) improved editing efficiencies up to 13-fold compared to transfecting the prime editing components as plasmids or ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). Finally, we demonstrated that this mRNA-based delivery approach can be used repeatedly to yield editing efficiencies exceeding 60% and to correct or introduce familial mutations causing Parkinson's disease in hPSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust induction of functional astrocytes using NGN2 expression in human pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play essential roles in normal brain function, with dysfunction implicated in diverse developmental and degenerative disease processes. Emerging evidence of profound species divergent features of astrocytes coupled with the relative inaccessibility of human brain tissue underscore the utility of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies for the generation and study of human astrocytes. However, existing approaches for hPSC-astrocyte generation are typically lengthy, incompletely characterized, or require intermediate purification steps, limiting their utility for multi-cell line, adequately powered functional studies. Here, we establish a rapid and highly scalable method for generating functional human induced astrocytes (hiAs) based upon transient Neurogenin 2 (NGN2) induction of neural progenitor-like cells followed by maturation in astrocyte media, which demonstrate remarkable homogeneity within the population and across 11 independent cell lines in the absence of additional purification steps. These hiAs express canonical astrocyte markers, respond to pro-inflammatory stimuli, exhibit ATP-induced calcium transients and support neuronal maturation in vitro. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal the generation of highly reproducible cell populations across individual donors, most closely resembling human fetal astrocytes, and highly similar to hPSC-derived astrocytes generated using more complex approaches. Finally, the hiAs capture key molecular hallmarks in a trisomy 21 disease model. Thus, hiAs provide a valuable and practical resource well-suited for study of basic human astrocyte function and dysfunction in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-block RNN Autoencoders Enable Broadband ECoG Signal Reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Neural dynamical models reconstruct neural data using dynamical systems. These models enable direct reconstruction and estimation of neural time-series data as well as estimation of neural latent states. Nonlinear neural dynamical models using recurrent neural networks in an encoder-decoder architecture have recently enabled accurate single-trial reconstructions of neural activity for neuronal spiking data. While these models have been applied to neural field potential data, they have only so far been applied to signal feature reconstruction (e.g. frequency band power), and have not yet produced direct reconstructions of broadband time-series data preserving signal phase and temporal resolution. Approach: Here we present two encoder-decoder model architectures - the RNN autoencoder (RAE) and multi-block RAE (MRAE) for direct time-series reconstruction of broadband neural data. We trained and tested models on multi-channel micro-Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from non-human primate motor corticies during unconstrained behavior. Main Results: We show that RAE reconstructs micro-electrocorticography recordings, but has reconstruction accuracy that is band-limited to model scale. The MRAE architecture overcomes these time-bandwidth restrictions, yielding broadband (0-100 Hz), accurate reconstructions of ECoG data. Significance: RAE and MRAE reconstruct broadband ECoG data through multiblock dynamical modeling. The MRAE overcomes time-bandwitdh restrictions to provide improved accuracy for long time duration signals. The reconstruction capabilities provided by these models for broadband neural signals like ECoG may enable the development of improved tools and analysis for basic scientific research and applications like brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered visual cortex excitability in premenstrual dysphoric disorder: evidence from magnetoencephalographic gamma oscillations and perceptual suppression</a></h4>

              
                Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by extreme mood shifts, anxiety, and irritability during the premenstrual period. Abnormal sensitivity to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that normally potentiates inhibition, and an increased ratio of neural excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) have been linked to the pathophysiology of PMDD. We hypothesized that in subjects with PMDD these factors will lead to an altered frequency of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) visual gamma oscillations, altered modulation of their power by the strength of excitatory drive and to an altered perceptual spatial suppression. We examined women with PMDD and age-matched control women twice: during the asymptomatic follicular and symptomatic luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (MC). MEG gamma oscillations were recorded while modulating excitatory drive to the visual cortex by increasing drift rate of high-contrast visual gratings. Perceptual suppression was assessed as a degree of impairment of the discrimination of visual motion direction with increasing stimulus size. In women with PMDD, the gamma response (GR) peak frequency and its modulation by the drift rate were normal, whereas modulation of the GR power was significantly altered. A moderate increase in drift rate had an unusually strong facilitating effect on the GR power in PMDD, regardless of the MC phase. In contrast, the effect of increasing drift rate, which normally suppresses GR power, was attenuated in PMDD in the luteal phase and predicted symptom severity estimated on the same day. Perceptual spatial suppression did not differ between the groups, but decreased from the follicular to the luteal phase only in PMDD subjects. The atypical GR power modulation suggests that neuronal excitability in the visual cortex is constitutively elevated in women with PMDD, and that their E/I ratio is additionally shifted toward excitation during the luteal phase, possibly due to an abnormal sensitivity to neurosteroids. However, the unchanged frequency of GR and normal spatial suppression in women with PMDD speak against the dysfunction of their inhibitory neurons, at least those involved in generation of visual gamma oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible communication between cell assemblies and 'reader' neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cell assemblies are considered fundamental units of brain activity, underlying diverse functions ranging from perception to memory and decision-making. Cell assemblies have historically been conceived of as internal representations of specific stimuli or actions. Alternatively, cell assemblies can be endogenously defined by their ability to effectively elicit specific responses in downstream ('reader') neurons. Yet, whether cell assemblies are selectively detected by downstream neurons remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence for such assembly-reader communication. Reader activation was genuinely collective, functionally selective, yet flexible, implementing both pattern separation and completion. These processes occurred at the time scale of membrane integration, synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations. Finally, assembly-reader couplings were selectively modified upon learning, indicating that they were plastic and reflected behaviorally relevant variables. These results support cell assemblies as an endogenous mechanism for brain function.

                Pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) are fundamental elements for motor control. However, it is largely unknown if PTNs are segregated into different subtypes with distinct roles in movement performance. Using anatomical, electrophysiological and optogenetics tools, we analyzed in both sexes' mice motor cortex, PTNs projecting to red and pontine midbrain nuclei, which are important hubs connecting cerebral cortex and cerebellum playing a critical role in the regulation of movement. We reveal that vast majority of M1 neurons projecting to the red and pontine nuclei constitutes different populations. Corticopontine neurons have higher conduction velocities and morphologically, a most homogeneous dendritic and spine distributions along cortical layers. Optogenetically inhibiting either kind projection, differentially affects forelimb movement onset and execution in a lever press task, but only the activity of corticopontine neurons is significantly correlated with trial-by-trial variations in reaction time. The results indicate that cortical neurons projecting to the red and pontine nuclei constitute distinct functional and anatomical pathways and they contribute differently to sensorimotor integration, suggesting that layer 5 output neurons are functionally compartmentalized generating, in parallel, different downstream coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal representation of a working memory-based decision strategy in the motor and prefrontal cortico-basal ganglia loops</a></h4>

              
                While animal and human decision strategies are typically explained by model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, their choice sequences often follow simple procedures based on working memory of past actions and rewards. Here we address how working memory-based choice strategies, such as win-stay-lose-switch (WSLS), are represented in the prefrontal and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops by simultaneous recording of neuronal activities in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the primary motor cortex (M1). In order to compare neuronal representations when rats employ working memory-based strategies, we developed a new task paradigm, a continuous/intermittent choice task, consisting of choice and no-choice trials. While the continuous condition (CC) consisted of only choice trials, in the intermittent condition (IC), a no-choice trial was inserted after each choice trial to disrupt working memory of the previous choice and reward. Behaviors in CC showed high proportions of win-stay and lose-switch choices, which could be regarded as "a noisy WSLS strategy." Poisson regression of neural spikes revealed encoding specifically in CC of the previous action and reward before action choice and prospective coding of WSLS action during action execution. A striking finding was that the DLS and M1 in the motor cortico-basal ganglia loop carry substantial WM information about previous choices, rewards, and their interactions, in addition to current action coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of the fear-responsive anterior hypothalamic area promotes avoidance and triggers compulsive grooming behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) is a key brain region for orchestrating defensive behaviors. Here, we first examined AHA activity patterns during fear conditioning using in vivo functional imaging. We observed that neuronal activity in the AHA increases during both foot shock delivery and foot-shock associated auditory cues. Moreover, we used a combination of optogenetics and behavioral assays to determine the functional connectivity between the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the AHA. We found that photoactivation of the VMH[-&gt;]AHA pathway is aversive and triggers compulsive grooming behavior. Furthermore, we observed spatial and temporal changes of grooming behavior during the periods following VMH[-&gt;]AHA photoactivation. Interestingly, whole brain metabolic mapping using positron emission tomography (PET) combined with optogenetic activation of the VMH[-&gt;]AHA pathway in anesthetized mice revealed the amygdala as a downstream area activated by the stimulation of this pathway. Together, our findings show that the AHA responds to threat and that such increases in activity are sufficient to trigger compulsive grooming behavior. Thus, our results may help to understand some neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by repetitive and compulsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Many but not all deep neural network audio models capture brain responses and exhibit hierarchical region correspondence</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural networks are commonly used as models of the visual system, but are less explored in audition. Prior work provided examples of audio-trained neural networks that produced good predictions of auditory cortical fMRI responses and exhibited correspondence between model stages and brain regions, but left it unclear whether these results generalize to other neural network models. We evaluated brain-model correspondence for publicly available audio neural network models along with in-house models trained on four different tasks. Most tested models out-predicted previous filter-bank models of auditory cortex, and exhibited systematic model-brain correspondence: middle stages best predicted primary auditory cortex while deep stages best predicted non-primary cortex. However, some state-of-the-art models produced substantially worse brain predictions. The training task influenced the prediction quality for specific cortical tuning properties, with best overall predictions resulting from models trained on multiple tasks. The results suggest the importance of task optimization in constraining brain representations.

	<p>Previous studies have shown that some negative emotions hinder estimation strategy execution. However, these studies rarely investigate the influence of negative emotions on the estimation strategy execution in individuals with trait anxiety. The present study examines the relationship between negative emotions and trait anxiety in individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; estimation strategy execution. Moreover, it looks into the influence of different emotion regulation strategies on their estimation strategy execution. In October 2010, 803 college students were evaluated using the Trait Anxiety Scale. From these participants, individuals with high and low trait anxiety were selected to complete the double-digit multiplication estimation task. The results showed that the estimation strategy&amp;amp;rsquo;s execution speed in individuals with high trait anxiety was slower than those with low trait anxiety under negative emotions (t (113) = &amp;amp;minus;2.269, p = 0.025, d = 0.427). Both expression inhibition and cognitive reappraisal could significantly improve the execution speed of the estimation strategy in low trait anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). For individuals with high trait anxiety, cognitive reappraisal regulating negative emotions can promote the estimation strategy&amp;amp;rsquo;s execution speed (p = 0.031). However, the use of expression inhibition has no significant effect on estimation strategy execution (p = 0.101). In summary, the present study revealed that different emotion regulation strategies moderated the arithmetic strategy execution of individuals with trait anxiety, and cognitive reappraisal had a better effect in individuals with high trait anxiety.</p>

	<p>Falls are common in patients with neurological diseases and can be very problematic. Recently, there has been an increase in fall prevention research in people with neurological diseases; however, these studies are usually condition-specific (e.g., only MS, PD or stroke). Here, our aim was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of an advanced and innovative dual-task, motor-cognitive rehabilitation program in individuals with different neurological diseases who are at risk of falling. We recruited 95 consecutive adults with neurological diseases who are at risk of falling and divided them into four groups: 31 with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 20 with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), 23 with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 21 with other neurological diseases (OND). Each patient completed a dual-task, motor-cognitive training program and underwent two test evaluations to assess balance, gait, fear of falling and walking performance at the pre-and post-intervention. We found that our experimental motor-cognitive, dual-task rehabilitation program was an effective method for improving walking balance, gait, walking endurance and speed, and fear of falling, and that it reduced the risk of falls in patients with different neurological diseases. This study presents an alternative approach for people with chronic neurological diseases and provides innovative data for managing this population.</p>

	<p>Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a common complication of chronic dopamine replacement therapy in the treatment of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and a noble cause of disability in advanced PD patients. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a novel type of non-coding RNA with a covalently closed-loop structure, which can regulate gene expression and participate in many biological processes. However, the biological roles of circRNAs in LID are not completely known. In the present study, we established typical LID rat models by unilateral lesions of the medial forebrain bundle and repeated levodopa therapy. High-throughput next-generation sequencing was used to screen circRNAs differentially expressed in the brain of LID and non-LID (NLID) rats, and key circRNAs were selected according to bioinformatics analyses. Regarding fold change &amp;amp;ge;2 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 as the cutoff value, there were a total of 99 differential circRNAs, including 39 up-regulated and 60 down-regulated circRNAs between the NLID and LID groups. The expression of rno-Rsf1_0012 was significantly increased in the striatum of LID rats and competitively bound rno-mir-298-5p. The high expression of target genes PCP and TBP in LID rats also supports the conclusion that rno-Rsf1_0012 may be related to the occurrence of LID.</p>

	<p>We investigated the effects of word length and frequency on eye movement control during Tibetan reading through two experiments. A preliminary experiment examined the predictive effect of word length and frequency on fixation duration and landing position using multiple linear regression analysis. In the formal experiment, we manipulated the length and frequency of target words simultaneously to investigate the effects of word length and frequency on fixation duration and landing position in Tibetan reading. In this study, we found that: (1) there were significant word-length and word-frequency effects affecting all lexical processing in Tibetan reading; (2) there are preferred viewing locations in Tibetan reading; specifically, for short words, it is the end, whereas for long words, it spans from the center to the beginning of the word; (3) word frequency does not affect preferred viewing location in Tibetan reading; (4) the preferred viewing position and the interaction of word length and viewing position found in this study supported the &amp;amp;ldquo;strategy-tactics&amp;amp;rdquo; approach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phase Advancing Is a Common Property of Multiple Neuron Classes in the Mouse Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Behavioral interactions with moving objects are challenged by response latencies within the sensory and motor nervous systems. In vision, the combined latency from phototransduction and synaptic transmission from the retina to central visual areas amounts to 50&ndash;100 ms, depending on stimulus conditions. Time required for generating appropriate motor output adds to this latency and further compounds the behavioral delay. Neuronal adaptations that help counter sensory latency within the retina have been demonstrated in some species, but how general these specializations are, and where in the circuitry they originate, remains unclear. To address this, we studied the timing of object motion-evoked responses at multiple signaling stages within the mouse retina using two-photon fluorescence calcium and glutamate imaging, targeted whole-cell electrophysiology, and computational modeling. We found that both ON-type and OFF-type ganglion cells, as well as the bipolar cells that innervate them, temporally advance the position encoding of a moving object and so help counter the inherent signaling delay in the retina. Model simulations show that this predictive capability is a direct consequence of the spatial extent of the cells&rsquo; linear visual receptive field, with no apparent specialized circuits that help predict beyond it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics and Potential Significance of Spontaneous Activity in the Habenula</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The habenula is an evolutionarily conserved structure of the vertebrate brain that is essential for behavioral flexibility and mood control. It is spontaneously active and is able to access diverse states when the animal is exposed to sensory stimuli. Here we investigate the dynamics of habenula spontaneous activity, to gain insight into how sensitivity is optimized. Two-photon calcium imaging was performed in resting zebrafish larvae at single-cell resolution. An analysis of avalanches of inferred spikes suggests that the habenula is subcritical. Activity had low covariance and a small mean, arguing against dynamic criticality. A multiple regression estimator of autocorrelation time suggests that the habenula is neither fully asynchronous nor perfectly critical, but is reverberating. This pattern of dynamics may enable integration of information and high flexibility in the tuning of network properties, thus providing a potential mechanism for the optimal responses to a changing environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Automatic Vehicle Fueling System using PLC Controlled Robotic Arm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The objective of this research is to design and develop a robotic arm for an automatic fuelling system using a PLC LogixPro simulation. The system includes the “FASS” concept, which is Fast, Accurate, Safe and Simple, to allow car users to have an efficient fuel filling system.   The design concept consists of three processes – identification of the vehicle, payment, and filling with the fuel. The first process identifies the presence of the car by the in-floor weight sensors. The weight sensor identifies the car, locks it in position, and activates the payment system. The second process activates the payment system. After payment is completed, the fuel cap will be opened to enable the system to start filling the fuel. If the payment doesn’t go through the car will be released, manual operation will be initialized, and the entire system will be reset.  A timer is included in the payment section to process the payment. In the third process, the filling arm is extended to the car, the fuel cap is opened, the fuel pump is inserted into the tank, and fuel is directed into the tank. Once the tank is full, filling is stopped, the pump is ejected, the fuel cap is closed, and the arm returned back to its position. Thus, an automatic vehicle fuelling system is created to overcome the problems of poor safety and longer waiting time during peak hours. The fuel cap is activated and deactivated by pressure and the sensor filler is stopped by a level sensor. The pump insert is activated and deactivated by a photosensor.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Public perceptions and interactions with UK COVID-19 Test, Trace and Isolate policies, and implications for pandemic infectious disease modelling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The efforts to contain SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been supported by Test, Trace and Isolate (TTI) systems in many settings, including the United Kingdom. Mathematical models of transmission and TTI interventions, used to inform design and policy choices, make assumptions about the public’s behaviour in the context of a rapidly unfolding and changeable emergency. This study investigates public perceptions and interactions with UK TTI policy in July 2021, assesses them against how TTI processes are conceptualised and represented in models, and then interprets the findings with modellers who have been contributing evidence to TTI policy. Methods 20 members of the public recruited via social media were interviewed for one hour about their perceptions and interactions with the UK TTI system. Thematic analysis identified key themes, which were then presented back to a workshop of pandemic infectious disease modellers who assessed these findings against assumptions made in TTI intervention modelling. Workshop members co-drafted this report. Results Themes included education about SARS-CoV-2, perceived risks, trust, mental health and practical concerns. Findings covered testing practices, including the uses of and trust in different types of testing, and the challenges of testing and isolating faced by different demographic groups. This information was judged as consequential to the modelling process, from guiding the selection of research questions, influencing choice of model structure, informing parameter ranges and validating or challenging assumptions, to highlighting where model assumptions are reasonable or where their poor reflection of practice might lead to uninformative results. Conclusions We conclude that deeper engagement with members of the public should be integrated at regular stages of public health intervention modelling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and laser-assisted new attachment procedure for the treatment of alveolar bone loss provoked by an aggressive pyogenic granuloma [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise training and dietary supplement on fat free mass and bone mass density during weight loss – a systematic review and meta-analysis. [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After a diet- or surgery induced weight loss almost 1/3 of lost weight consists of fat free mass (FFM) if carried out without additional therapy. Exercise training and a sufficient supply of protein, calcium and vitamin D is recommended to reduce the loss of FFM. Objective: To investigate the effect of exercise training, protein, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation on the preservation of FFM during non-surgical and surgical weight loss and of the combination of all interventions together in adults with obesity. Methods: A systematic review was performed with a pairwise meta-analysis and an exploratory network meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. Results: Thirty studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The pairwise meta-analysis showed for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. High Protein a moderate and statistically significant effect size (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86), for Exercise Training + High Protein vs. Exercise Training a high but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.91; 95% CI -0.59 to 2.41) and for Exercise Training alone vs. Control a moderate but statistically not significant effect size (SMD 0.67; 95% CI -0.25 to 1.60). In the exploratory network meta-analysis three interventions showed statistically significant effect sizes compared to Control and all of them included the treatment Exercise Training. Conclusions: Results underline the importance of exercise training and a sufficient protein intake to preserve FFM during weight loss in adults with obesity. The effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains controversial and further research are needed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Account of chickenpox progression over 10 days [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease; caused by the varicella-zoster virus primary infection. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, nocturnal polydipsia, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus (intensely pruritic erythematous macules), lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. The most commonly occurring symptom of chickenpox is a vesicular rash that appears on the scalp, back and front of the neck, face and scapulae, and then disseminates distally to the limbs. In this case report, the patient face, neck and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body and the rest of the body except the legs, hands, genital areas and buttocks, were also highly infected. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day was given for ten days to cure chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits the replication of the varicella zoster virus, and has the ability to eradicate varicella zoster virus and relieve the symptoms more readily.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Desirable attributes of theories, models, and frameworks for implementation strategy design in healthcare: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Implementation strategies can facilitate the adoption of evidence-based practices and policies. A wide range of theoretical approaches—theories, models, and frameworks—can be used to inform implementation strategy design in different ways (e.g., guiding barrier and enabler assessment to implementing evidence-based interventions). While selection criteria and attributes of theoretical approaches for use in implementation strategy design have been studied, they have never been synthesized. Furthermore, theoretical approaches have never been classified according to desirable criteria and attributes for use in implementation strategy design. This scoping review aims to a) identify the literature reporting on the selection of theoretical approaches for informing implementation strategy design in healthcare and b) understand the suggested use of these approaches in implementation strategy design. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidelines will be used to conduct this scoping review. A search of three bibliographical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL) will be conducted for peer-reviewed discussion, methods, protocol, or review papers. Data will be managed using the Covidence software. Two review team members will independently perform screening, full text review and data extraction. Results: Results will include a list of selection criteria and attributes of theoretical approaches for use in research on implementation strategy design. Descriptive data regarding selection criteria and attributes will be synthesized graphically and in table format. Data regarding the suggested use of theoretical approaches in implementation strategy design will be presented narratively. Conclusions: Results will be used to classify existing theoretical approaches according to the attributes and selection criteria identified in this scoping review. Envisioned next steps include an online tool that will be created to assist researchers in selecting theories, models, and frameworks for implementation strategy design.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of serum levels of vitamin D on lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and insulin resistance in obese type 2 diabetes patients: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetes patients have a higher chance of developing dyslipidemia and increased release of free fatty acids, which participate in developing insulin-resistant fat cells. On the other hand, vitamin D insufficiency is linked to the evolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study examines the impact of vitamin D serum levels on lipid profiles and insulin resistance concerning glycemic indices in obese T2DM patients. Methods: During the data collecting stage, 47 diabetes patients were chosen from the out-patient clinic. The control individuals were selected from the general population and were equivalent to the matching patients, with a total of 43 healthy participants. After an overnight fast, a venous blood sample was collected from each individual to test insulin and vitamin D3 levels using particular ELISA kits. In addition, by colorimetric test, serum was used to estimate total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Aside from that, fasting serum glucose levels were measured (FSG). Results: Fasting serum glucose (FSG), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, and triglycerides, all of these values were significantly elevated in people with diabetes as compared to controls (p-value <0.05) when the serum level of vitamin D was markedly low. In contrast, insulin and high-density lipoprotein values had decreased significantly in the diabetic population compared to controls (p-value <0.05) and were not correlated to vitamin D levels. Conclusions: Diabetes patients had higher FSG, HOMA-IR, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (TC: HDL-C), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (TG: HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios (LDL-C: HDL). In obese diabetic individuals, vitamin D levels had a significant impact on total cholesterol, LDL-C, and the TC:HDL-C ratio.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smartphone applications are used for self-management, telerehabilitation, evaluation and data collection in low back pain healthcare: a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Technological developments have accelerated notably in the field of telecommunications in the last few decades. Smartphone use has grown in providing healthcare for patients with low back pain (LBP), but the literature lacks an analysis of the use of smartphone apps. This scoping review aimed to identify current areas of smartphone apps use for managing LBP. We also aimed to evaluate the current status of the effectiveness or scientific validity of such use and determine perspectives for their potential development. Methods: We searched PubMed, PEDro and Embase for articles published in English up to May 3rd, 2021 that investigated smartphone use for LBP healthcare and their purpose. All types of study design were accepted. Studies concerning telemedicine or telerehabilitation but without use of a smartphone were not included. The same search strategy was performed by two researchers independently and a third researcher validated the synthesis of the included studies. Results: We included 43 articles: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=12), study protocols (n=6), reliability/validity studies (n=6), systematic reviews (n=7), cohort studies (n=4), qualitative studies (n=6), and case series (n=1). The purposes of the smartphone app were for 1) evaluation, 2) telerehabilitation, 3) self-management, and 4) data collection. Self-management was the most-studied use, showing promising results derived from moderate- to good-quality RCTs for patients with chronic LBP and patients after spinal surgery. Promising results exist regarding evaluation and data collection use and contradictory results regarding measurement use. Conclusions: This scoping review revealed a growing scientific literature regarding the use of smartphone apps for LBP patients. The identified purposes point to current scientific status and perspectives for further studies including RCTs and systematic reviews targeting specific usage. Caution should be taken to monitor the impact of smartphone-related compulsive behaviour.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine nudibranch associated bacteria against tropical human skin pathogens [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Skin disease is the fourth most common disease among all diseases. The number of cases of skin diseases continues to increase, and people commonly use antibiotics to treat these diseases. Nevertheless, overuse of antibiotics can increase the resistance of these pathogens. Hence, the study of novel antibiotic compounds against multi-drug resistant (MDR) skin pathogens is urgently needed. Methods: This study describes the antimicrobial diversity of bacteria associated with three species of marine nudibranchs (Jorunna funebris, Gymnodoris rubropapulosa, and Glossodoris atromarginata) sampled from Jepara coastal waters, the North Java Sea in August 2020. A total of 115 bacterial strains were selected for their prospective antipathogenic compounds against the pathogens Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Malassezia furfur. Results: A total of 24 bacterial isolates (20.87%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against the pathogens that were selected and molecularly identified. Analyses of the gene of 16S rRNA discovered that these 24 isolates were associated with 11 genera of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, including Bacillus as the dominant genus, followed by Streptomyces, Gordonia, Salinicola, Thalassospira, Halomonas, Dietzia, Brevibacterium, Paracoccus, Pseudovibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, and Pseudomonas. None of the 24 antimicrobial bacterial strains possessed type-1 polyketide synthases (PKS-I). One strain possessed type II polyketide synthases (PKS-II), and five strains possessed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. The amounts of bacterial genus and strains in the three nudibranchs differed significantly, as did the proportions of antimicrobial strains in each nudibranch species. The antibacterial strains isolated from G. atromarginata were the highest number (62.5%), followed by J. funebris (20.8%) and G. rubropapulosa (16.7%). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that nudibranch species harbor prominent and varied communities of bacteria and reveal that many nudibranch-associated bacteria have the potential for the advancement of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of mice that lack retinal input, a population of large terminals supplants the synaptic arrangements normally made by the missing retinogeniculate terminals. To identify potential sources of these “retinogeniculate replacement terminals,” we used mutant mice (<i>math5</i>

In this line, we labeled LGN terminals that originate from the primary visual cortex (V1) or the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG), and compared their ultrastructure to retinogeniculate, V1 or PBG terminals in the dLGN of C57Blk6 (WT) mice (schematically depicted above graph). Corticogeniculate terminals labeled in WT and <i>math5</i>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer potential of turmeric (Curcuma longa) ethanol extract and prediction of its mechanism through the Akt1 pathway [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has high potential as a traditional anticancer drug. This study aimed to analyze the anticancer activity of turmeric ethanol extract on T47D cells and examine the interaction of Akt1 protein with compounds contained in turmeric. Methods: The cytotoxicity assay was conducted using WST-1 reagents. Apoptosis assay used annexin V-PI, whereas cell cycle assay used PI, and then the results were analyzed using a flow cytometer. LC-HRMS analysis was conducted to identify the active compounds. Docking between Akt1 and ligands was performed using Autodock 4.2 software. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using YASARA with a time parameter of 20 ns, pH 7.4, and 37°C. Results: The extract had a strong toxicity on T47D cells (cytotoxicity IC50 value: 26.36 ± 1.55 µg/mL). The extract induced apoptosis of T47D cells at the IC50 dose (~30% cells) and induced the cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Curcumin, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid and caryophyllene oxide had lower binding energy into Akt1 than AZD5363 used as a positive control. Curcumin, Ar-turmerone, and α-curcumene bind in the ATP binding pocket of Akt1, so the compounds have a high potential to be an ATP-competitive Akt1 inhibitors. The interaction of Akt1 with the compound contained in turmeric had an RMSD backbone value that was more stable than that of ATP and AZD5363. Root-mean-square fluctuation values indicated that amino acid residues that had an essential role in ligand binding sites were stable during simulation. Conclusions: The turmeric ethanol extract had a potential anti-cancer effect by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell cycle progression on T47D cells. The docking analysis showed that the active compounds of the extract, such as curcumin, Ar-turmerone, caryophyllene oxide, and α-curcumene, were able to bind into the ATP binding pocket of Akt1 that might inhibit the protein activity and induce cell cycle arrest.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of the reaction-structure coupling in temperature compensation of the KaiABC circadian rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masaki Sasai</p>

When the mixture solution of cyanobacterial proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, is incubated with ATP in vitro, the phosphorylation level of KaiC shows stable oscillations with the temperature-compensated circadian period. Elucidating this temperature compensation is essential for understanding the KaiABC circadian clock, but its mechanism has remained a mystery. We analyzed the KaiABC temperature compensation by developing a theoretical model describing the feedback relations among reactions and structural transitions in the KaiC molecule. The model showed that the reduced structural cooperativity should weaken the negative feedback coupling among reactions and structural transitions, which enlarges the oscillation amplitude and period, explaining the observed significant period extension upon single amino-acid residue substitution. We propose that an increase in thermal fluctuations similarly attenuates the reaction-structure feedback, explaining the temperature compensation in the KaiABC clock. The model explained the experimentally observed responses of the oscillation phase to the temperature shift or the ADP-concentration change and suggested that the ATPase reactions in the CI domain of KaiC affect the period depending on how the reaction rates are modulated. The KaiABC clock provides a unique opportunity to analyze how the reaction-structure coupling regulates the system-level synchronized oscillations of molecules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Probing the rules of cell coordination in live tissues by interpretable machine learning based on graph neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takaki Yamamoto, Katie Cockburn, Valentina Greco, Kyogo Kawaguchi</p>

Robustness in developing and homeostatic tissues is supported by various types of spatiotemporal cell-to-cell interactions. Although live imaging and cell tracking are powerful in providing direct evidence of cell coordination rules, extracting and comparing these rules across many tissues with potentially different length and timescales of coordination requires a versatile framework of analysis. Here we demonstrate that graph neural network (GNN) models are suited for this purpose, by showing how they can be applied to predict cell fate in tissues and utilized to infer the cell interactions governing the multicellular dynamics. Analyzing the live mammalian epidermis data, where spatiotemporal graphs constructed from cell tracks and cell contacts are given as inputs, GNN discovers distinct neighbor cell fate coordination rules that depend on the region of the body. This approach demonstrates how the GNN framework is powerful in inferring general cell interaction rules from live data without prior knowledge of the signaling involved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing global COVID-19 vaccine allocation: An agent-based computational model of 148 countries</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingfeng Li, Yajing Huang</p>
Background <p>Based on the principles of equity and effectiveness, the World Health Organization and COVAX formulate vaccine allocation as a mathematical optimization problem. This study aims to solve the optimization problem using agent-based simulations.</p> Methods <p>We built open-sourced agent-based models to simulate virus transition among a demographically representative sample of 198 million people in 148 countries using advanced computational services. <i>All countries continuing their current vaccine progress</i> is defined as the baseline scenario. Comparison scenarios include achieving minimum vaccination rates and allocating vaccines based on pandemic levels.</p> Findings <p>The simulations are fitted using the pandemic data from 148 countries from January 2020 to June 2021. Under the baseline scenario, the world will add 24.36 million cases and 468,945 deaths during the projection period of three months. Inoculating at least 10%, 20%, and 26% of populations in all countries requires 1.12, 3.31, and 5.00 million additional vaccine doses every day, respectively. Achieving these benchmarks reduces new cases by 0.56, 2.74, and 3.32 million, respectively. If allocated by the current global distribution, 5.00 million additional vaccine doses will only avert 1.45 million new cases. If those 5.00 million vaccines are allocated based on projected cases in each country, the averted cases will increase more than six-fold to 9.20 million. Similar differences between allocation methods are observed in averted deaths.</p> Conclusion <p>The global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines can be optimized to achieve better outcomes in terms of both equity and effectiveness. Alternative vaccine allocation methods may avert several times more cases and deaths than the current global distribution. With reasonable requirements on additional vaccines, COVAX could adopt alternative allocation strategies that reduce cross-country inequity and save more lives.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MouseNet: A biologically constrained convolutional neural network model for the mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianghong Shi, Bryan Tripp, Eric Shea-Brown, Stefan Mihalas, Michael A. Buice</p>

Convolutional neural networks trained on object recognition derive inspiration from the neural architecture of the visual system in mammals, and have been used as models of the feedforward computation performed in the primate ventral stream. In contrast to the deep hierarchical organization of primates, the visual system of the mouse has a shallower arrangement. Since mice and primates are both capable of visually guided behavior, this raises questions about the role of architecture in neural computation. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for building a biologically constrained convolutional neural network model of the mouse visual cortex. The architecture and structural parameters of the network are derived from experimental measurements, specifically the 100-micrometer resolution interareal connectome, the estimates of numbers of neurons in each area and cortical layer, and the statistics of connections between cortical layers. This network is constructed to support detailed task-optimized models of mouse visual cortex, with neural populations that can be compared to specific corresponding populations in the mouse brain. Using a well-studied image classification task as our working example, we demonstrate the computational capability of this mouse-sized network. Given its relatively small size, MouseNet achieves roughly 2/3rds the performance level on ImageNet as VGG16. In combination with the large scale Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset, we use representational similarity analysis to quantify the extent to which MouseNet recapitulates the neural representation in mouse visual cortex. Importantly, we provide evidence that optimizing for task performance does not improve similarity to the corresponding biological system beyond a certain point. We demonstrate that the distributions of some physiological quantities are closer to the observed distributions in the mouse brain after task training. We encourage the use of the MouseNet architecture by making the code freely available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">What lies underneath: Precise classification of brain states using time-dependent topological structure of dynamics</a></h4>

The self-organising global dynamics underlying brain states emerge from complex recursive nonlinear interactions between interconnected brain regions. Until now, most efforts of capturing the causal mechanistic generating principles have supposed underlying stationarity, being unable to describe the non-stationarity of brain dynamics, i.e. time-dependent changes. Here, we present a novel framework able to characterise brain states with high specificity, precisely by modelling the time-dependent dynamics. Through describing a topological structure associated to the brain state at each moment in time (its attractor or ‘information structure’), we are able to classify different brain states by using the statistics across time of these structures hitherto hidden in the neuroimaging dynamics. Proving the strong potential of this framework, we were able to classify resting-state BOLD fMRI signals from two classes of post-comatose patients (minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) compared with healthy controls with very high precision.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EpiBeds: Data informed modelling of the COVID-19 hospital burden in England</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher E. Overton, Lorenzo Pellis, Helena B. Stage, Francesca Scarabel, Joshua Burton, Christophe Fraser, Ian Hall, Thomas A. House, Chris Jewell, Anel Nurtay, Filippo Pagani, Katrina A. Lythgoe</p>

The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic put considerable strain on healthcare systems worldwide. In order to predict the effect of the local epidemic on hospital capacity in England, we used a variety of data streams to inform the construction and parameterisation of a hospital progression model, EpiBeds, which was coupled to a model of the generalised epidemic. In this model, individuals progress through different pathways (e.g. may recover, die, or progress to intensive care and recover or die) and data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow the different clinical pathways, the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic, and to make short-term predictions of hospital bed demand. The construction of EpiBeds makes it straightforward to adapt to different patient pathways and settings beyond England. As part of the UK response to the pandemic, EpiBeds provided weekly forecasts to the NHS for hospital bed occupancy and admissions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland at national and regional scales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational framework for modelling infectious disease policy based on age and household structure with applications to the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joe Hilton, Heather Riley, Lorenzo Pellis, Rabia Aziza, Samuel P. C. Brand, Ivy K. Kombe, John Ojal, Andrea Parisi, Matt J. Keeling, D. James Nokes, Robert Manson-Sawko, Thomas House</p>

The widespread, and in many countries unprecedented, use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for mathematical models which can estimate the impact of these measures while accounting for the highly heterogeneous risk profile of COVID-19. Models accounting either for age structure or the household structure necessary to explicitly model many NPIs are commonly used in infectious disease modelling, but models incorporating both levels of structure present substantial computational and mathematical challenges due to their high dimensionality. Here we present a modelling framework for the spread of an epidemic that includes explicit representation of age structure and household structure. Our model is formulated in terms of tractable systems of ordinary differential equations for which we provide an open-source Python implementation. Such tractability leads to significant benefits for model calibration, exhaustive evaluation of possible parameter values, and interpretability of results. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model through four policy case studies, where we quantify the likely benefits of the following measures which were either considered or implemented in the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic: control of within- and between-household mixing through NPIs; formation of support bubbles during lockdown periods; out-of-household isolation (OOHI); and temporary relaxation of NPIs during holiday periods. Our ordinary differential equation formulation and associated analysis demonstrate that multiple dimensions of risk stratification and social structure can be incorporated into infectious disease models without sacrificing mathematical tractability. This model and its software implementation expand the range of tools available to infectious disease policy analysts.

Comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer subtypes is essential for predicting clinical outcomes and searching for personalized treatments. We present bnClustOmics, a statistical model and computational tool for multi-omics unsupervised clustering, which serves a dual purpose: Clustering patient samples based on a Bayesian network mixture model and learning the networks of omics variables representing these clusters. The discovered networks encode interactions among all omics variables and provide a molecular characterization of each patient subgroup. We conducted simulation studies that demonstrated the advantages of our approach compared to other clustering methods in the case where the generative model is a mixture of Bayesian networks. We applied bnClustOmics to a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) dataset comprising genome (mutation and copy number), transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome data. We identified three main HCC subtypes together with molecular characteristics, some of which are associated with survival even when adjusting for the clinical stage. Cluster-specific networks shed light on the links between genotypes and molecular phenotypes of samples within their respective clusters and suggest targets for personalized treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A curated data resource of 214K metagenomes for characterization of the global antimicrobial resistome</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hannah-Marie Martiny, Patrick Munk, Christian Brinch, Frank M. Aarestrup, Thomas N. Petersen</p>

The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) calls for new epidemiological surveillance methods, as well as a deeper understanding of how antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been transmitted around the world. The large pool of sequencing data available in public repositories provides an excellent resource for monitoring the temporal and spatial dissemination of AMR in different ecological settings. However, only a limited number of research groups globally have the computational resources to analyze such data. We retrieved 442 Tbp of sequencing reads from 214,095 metagenomic samples from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and aligned them using a uniform approach against ARGs and 16S/18S rRNA genes. Here, we present the results of this extensive computational analysis and share the counts of reads aligned. Over 6.76∙10<sup>8</sup> read fragments were assigned to ARGs and 3.21∙10<sup>9</sup> to rRNA genes, where we observed distinct differences in both the abundance of ARGs and the link between microbiome and resistome compositions across various sampling types. This collection is another step towards establishing global surveillance of AMR and can serve as a resource for further research into the environmental spread and dynamic changes of ARGs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Anterior cingulate cortex causally supports flexible learning under motivationally challenging and cognitively demanding conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kianoush Banaie Boroujeni, Michelle K. Sigona, Robert Louie Treuting, Thomas J. Manuel, Charles F. Caskey, Thilo Womelsdorf</p>

Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum (STR) contain neurons encoding not only the expected values of actions, but also the value of stimulus features irrespective of actions. Values about stimulus features in ACC or STR might contribute to adaptive behavior by guiding fixational information sampling and biasing choices toward relevant objects, but they might also have indirect motivational functions by enabling subjects to estimate the value of putting effort into choosing objects. Here, we tested these possibilities by modulating neuronal activity in ACC and STR of nonhuman primates using transcranial ultrasound stimulation while subjects learned the relevance of objects in situations with varying motivational and cognitive demands. Motivational demand was indexed by varying gains and losses during learning, while cognitive demand was varied by increasing the uncertainty about which object features could be relevant during learning. We found that ultrasound stimulation of the ACC, but not the STR, reduced learning efficiency and prolonged information sampling when the task required averting losses and motivational demands were high. Reduced learning efficiency was particularly evident at high cognitive demands and immediately after subjects experienced a loss of already attained tokens. These results suggest that the ACC supports flexible learning of feature values when loss experiences impose a motivational challenge and when uncertainty about the relevance of objects is high. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence that the ACC facilitates resource allocation and improves visual information sampling during adaptive behavior.

Tardigrades are able to tolerate almost complete dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state called anhydrobiosis and resume their animation upon rehydration. Dehydrated tardigrades are exceptionally stable and withstand various physical extremes. Although trehalose and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been extensively studied as potent protectants against dehydration in other anhydrobiotic organisms, tardigrades produce high amounts of tardigrade-unique protective proteins. Cytoplasmic-abundant heat-soluble (CAHS) proteins are uniquely invented in the lineage of eutardigrades, a major class of the phylum Tardigrada and are essential for their anhydrobiotic survival. However, the precise mechanisms of their action in this protective role are not fully understood. In the present study, we first postulated the presence of tolerance proteins that form protective condensates via phase separation in a stress-dependent manner and searched for tardigrade proteins that reversibly form condensates upon dehydration-like stress. Through a comprehensive search using a desolvating agent, trifluoroethanol (TFE), we identified 336 proteins, collectively dubbed “TFE-Dependent ReversiblY condensing Proteins (T-DRYPs).” Unexpectedly, we rediscovered CAHS proteins as highly enriched in T-DRYPs, 3 of which were major components of T-DRYPs. We revealed that these CAHS proteins reversibly polymerize into many cytoskeleton-like filaments depending on hyperosmotic stress in cultured cells and undergo reversible gel-transition in vitro. Furthermore, CAHS proteins increased cell stiffness in a hyperosmotic stress-dependent manner and counteract the cell shrinkage caused by osmotic pressure, and even improved the survival against hyperosmotic stress. The conserved putative helical C-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for filament formation by CAHS proteins, and mutations disrupting the secondary structure of this region impaired both the filament formation and the gel transition. On the basis of these results, we propose that CAHS proteins are novel cytoskeleton-like proteins that form filamentous networks and undergo gel-transition in a stress-dependent manner to provide on-demand physical stabilization of cell integrity against deformative forces during dehydration and could contribute to the exceptional physical stability in a dehydrated state.

Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) plays a critical role as an essential electrolyte in all biological systems. Genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> biosensors are promising tools to further improve our understanding of K<sup>+</sup>-dependent processes under normal and pathological conditions. Here, we report the crystal structure of a previously reported genetically encoded fluorescent K<sup>+</sup> biosensor, GINKO1, in the K<sup>+</sup>-bound state. Using structure-guided optimization and directed evolution, we have engineered an improved K<sup>+</sup> biosensor, designated GINKO2, with higher sensitivity and specificity. We have demonstrated the utility of GINKO2 for in vivo detection and imaging of K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in multiple model organisms, including bacteria, plants, and mice.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Polygenic signals of sex differences in selection in humans from the UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Filip Ruzicka, Luke Holman, Tim Connallon</p>

Sex differences in the fitness effects of genetic variants can influence the rate of adaptation and the maintenance of genetic variation. For example, “sexually antagonistic” (SA) variants, which are beneficial for one sex and harmful for the other, can both constrain adaptation and increase genetic variability for fitness components such as survival, fertility, and disease susceptibility. However, detecting variants with sex-differential fitness effects is difficult, requiring genome sequences and fitness measurements from large numbers of individuals. Here, we develop new theory for studying sex-differential selection across a complete life cycle and test our models with genotypic and reproductive success data from approximately 250,000 UK Biobank individuals. We uncover polygenic signals of sex-differential selection affecting survival, reproductive success, and overall fitness, with signals of sex-differential reproductive selection reflecting a combination of SA polymorphisms and sexually concordant polymorphisms in which the strength of selection differs between the sexes. Moreover, these signals hold up to rigorous controls that minimise the contributions of potential confounders, including sequence mapping errors, population structure, and ascertainment bias. Functional analyses reveal that sex-differentiated sites are enriched in phenotype-altering genomic regions, including coding regions and loci affecting a range of quantitative traits. Population genetic analyses show that sex-differentiated sites exhibit evolutionary histories dominated by genetic drift and/or transient balancing selection, but not long-term balancing selection, which is consistent with theoretical predictions of effectively weak SA balancing selection in historically small populations. Overall, our results are consistent with polygenic sex-differential—including SA—selection in humans. Evidence for sex-differential selection is particularly strong for variants affecting reproductive success, in which the potential contributions of nonrandom sampling to signals of sex differentiation can be excluded.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Clock gene-dependent glutamate dynamics in the bean bug brain regulate photoperiodic reproduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masaharu Hasebe, Sakiko Shiga</p>

Animals adequately modulate their physiological status and behavior according to the season. Many animals sense photoperiod for seasonal adaptation, and the circadian clock is suggested to play an essential role in photoperiodic time measurement. However, circadian clock-driven neural signals in the brain that convey photoperiodic information remain unclear. Here, we focused on brain extracellular dynamics of a classical neurotransmitter glutamate, which is widely used for brain neurotransmission, and analyzed its involvement in photoperiodic responses using the bean bug <i>Riptortus pedestris</i> that shows clear photoperiodism in reproduction. Extracellular glutamate levels in the whole brain were significantly higher under short-day conditions, which cause a reproductive diapause, than those under long-day conditions. The photoperiodic change in glutamate levels was clearly abolished by knockdown of the clock gene <i>period</i>. We also demonstrated that genetic modulation of glutamate dynamics by knockdown of glutamate-metabolizing enzyme genes, <i>glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase</i> (<i>got</i>) and <i>glutamine synthetase</i> (<i>gs</i>), attenuated photoperiodic responses in reproduction. Further, we investigated glutamate-mediated photoperiodic modulations at a cellular level, focusing on the pars intercerebralis (PI) neurons that photoperiodically change their neural activity and promote oviposition. Electrophysiological analyses showed that L-Glutamate acts as an inhibitory signal to PI neurons via glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl). Additionally, combination of electrophysiology and genetics revealed that knockdown of <i>got</i>, <i>gs</i>, and <i>glucl</i> disrupted cellular photoperiodic responses of the PI neurons, in addition to reproductive phenotypes. Our results reveal that the extracellular glutamate dynamics are photoperiodically regulated depending on the clock gene and play an essential role in the photoperiodic control of reproduction via inhibitory pathways.

Conventional cuvette-based and microfluidics-based electroporation approaches for bacterial gene delivery have distinct advantages, but they are typically limited to relatively small sample volumes, reducing their utility for applications requiring high throughput such as the generation of mutant libraries. Here, we present a scalable, large-scale bacterial gene delivery approach enabled by a disposable, user-friendly microfluidic electroporation device requiring minimal device fabrication and straightforward operation. We demonstrate that the proposed device can outperform conventional cuvettes in a range of situations, including across <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains with a range of electroporation efficiencies, and we use its large-volume bacterial electroporation capability to generate a library of transposon mutants in the anaerobic gut commensal <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attractive serial dependence overcomes repulsive neuronal adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Timothy C. Sheehan, John T. Serences</p>

Sensory responses and behavior are strongly shaped by stimulus history. For example, perceptual reports are sometimes biased toward previously viewed stimuli (serial dependence). While behavioral studies have pointed to both perceptual and postperceptual origins of this phenomenon, neural data that could elucidate where these biases emerge is limited. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses while human participants (male and female) performed a delayed orientation discrimination task. While behavioral reports were attracted to the previous stimulus, response patterns in visual cortex were repelled. We reconciled these opposing neural and behavioral biases using a model where both sensory encoding and readout are shaped by stimulus history. First, neural adaptation reduces redundancy at encoding and leads to the repulsive biases that we observed in visual cortex. Second, our modeling work suggest that serial dependence is induced by readout mechanisms that account for adaptation in visual cortex. According to this account, the visual system can simultaneously improve efficiency via adaptation while still optimizing behavior based on the temporal structure of natural stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pax6 limits the competence of developing cerebral cortical cells to respond to inductive intercellular signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martine Manuel, Kai Boon Tan, Zrinko Kozic, Michael Molinek, Tiago Sena Marcos, Maizatul Fazilah Abd Razak, Dániel Dobolyi, Ross Dobie, Beth E. P. Henderson, Neil C. Henderson, Wai Kit Chan, Michael I. Daw, John O. Mason, David J. Price</p>

The development of stable specialized cell types in multicellular organisms relies on mechanisms controlling inductive intercellular signals and the competence of cells to respond to such signals. In developing cerebral cortex, progenitors generate only glutamatergic excitatory neurons despite being exposed to signals with the potential to initiate the production of other neuronal types, suggesting that their competence is limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this limitation is due to their expression of transcription factor Pax6. We used bulk and single-cell RNAseq to show that conditional cortex-specific Pax6 deletion from the onset of cortical neurogenesis allowed some progenitors to generate abnormal lineages resembling those normally found outside the cortex. Analysis of selected gene expression showed that the changes occurred in specific spatiotemporal patterns. We then compared the responses of control and Pax6-deleted cortical cells to in vivo and in vitro manipulations of extracellular signals. We found that Pax6 loss increased cortical progenitors’ competence to generate inappropriate lineages in response to extracellular factors normally present in developing cortex, including the morphogens Shh and Bmp4. Regional variation in the levels of these factors could explain spatiotemporal patterns of fate change following Pax6 deletion in vivo. We propose that Pax6’s main role in developing cortical cells is to minimize the risk of their development being derailed by the potential side effects of morphogens engaged contemporaneously in other essential functions.

                Background: As Malaysia struggles with the battle to retain talented workers, the retention of persons with disabilities (PWDs) remains a major challenge in innovation management. Malaysia currently has the lowest retention of PWDs in innovation management in The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The purpose of this study is to develop a unique framework to enhance the inclusion of PWDs in Malaysia.  Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to 200 PWDs in the central region of Malaysia.   Results: Based on the results of this research, four crucial variables (salary, compensation, career advancement and reward management) contributed to the lack of involvement in innovation management among PWDs in Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study focuses on 200 PWDs in Malaysia. Despite the fact that PWDs’ involvement in innovation management is the lowest, there is a lack of research initiative and practitioner commitment to address this issue. Serving as preliminary research in Malaysia, this study develops a unique framework to fill the gap.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (pvWMHs) are commonly observed on MRI in older individuals and are associated with cognitive and motor decline. The etiology of pvWMH remains unknown. Venous collagenosis has been implicated, which may also interfere with perivascular fluid flow leading to dilation of perivascular spaces (PVS). Here, we examine relationships between in vivo pvWMH volume and ex vivo morphological quantification of collagenosis and the PVS in veins and arteries.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain tissue from 25 Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Research Center subjects was selected to cover the full range of WMH burden. Tissue from white matter abutting the ventricle was stained with Masson's trichrome and smooth muscle actin. An automated hue based algorithm identified and segmented vessel into collagenized vessel walls, lumen, and PVS. Multiple linear regressions with pvWMH volume as the dependent variable and either collagen thickness or PVS width were performed with covariates of vessel diameter, age at death, sex, and interval between MRI and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PVS width and collagen thickness were significantly correlated in both arteries (r = 0.21, p = 0.001) and veins (r = 0.23, p = 0.001). Increased venous collagen (p = 0.017) was a significant predictor of higher pvWMH burden while arterial collagen was not (p = 0.128). Neither PVS width in arteries (p = 0.937) nor veins (p = 0.133) predicted pvWMH burden.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings are consistent with a model in which venous collagenosis mediates the relationship between vascular risk factors and pvWMH. This study confirms the importance of changes to the venous system in contributing to MRI white matter lesions commonly observed with advanced age. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The patent landscape in the field of stem cell therapy: closing the gap between research and clinic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell technology is a powerful tool ready to respond to the needs of modern medicine that is experiencing rapid technological development. Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.

     alt="Tonotopic differentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing machinery in the auditory brainstem during the prehearing period and its selective deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice"/>
<p>We identified protein-specific and age-dependent tonotopic distributions of five key presynaptic proteins in the developing auditory brainstem and their selective alterations in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. The tonotopic maturation of the presynaptic machinery may provide a potential mechanism for tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development of auditory circuits.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopic organization is a fundamental feature of the auditory system. In the developing auditory brainstem, the ontogeny and maturation of neurotransmission progress from high to low frequencies along the tonotopic axis. To explore the underlying mechanism of this tonotopic development, we aim to determine whether the presynaptic machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release is tonotopically differentiated during development. In the current study, we examined vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and calcium sensors, two central players responsible for loading neurotransmitter into synaptic vesicles and for triggering neurotransmitter release in a calcium-dependent manner, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry, we characterized the distribution patterns of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2, vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT), and calcium sensor synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and 2 in the developing mouse medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We identified tonotopic gradients of VGLUT1, VGAT, Syt1, and Syt2 in the first postnatal week, with higher protein densities in the more medial (high-frequency) portion of the MNTB. These gradients gradually flattened before the onset of hearing. In contrast, VGLUT2 was distributed relatively uniformly along the tonotopic axis during this prehearing period. In mice lacking Fragile X mental retardation protein, an mRNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic development and plasticity, progress to achieve the mature-like organization was altered for VGLUT1, Syt1, and Syt2, but not for VGAT. Together, our results identified novel organization patterns of selective presynaptic proteins in immature auditory synapses, providing a potential mechanism that may contribute to tonotopic differentiation of neurotransmission during normal and abnormal development.</p>

                Chipman and colleagues characterize NMDA-receptor-dependent compensatory plasticity in the adult hippocampus, consistent with expression of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP). Mechanistically, the compensatory plasticity is driven by NMDAR-dependent spine growth and active zone expansion. Remarkably, compensatory plasticity at excitatory synapses is linked to potentiation of inhibitory transmission, ultimately favoring net inhibition.

                The prostanoid receptor EP2 maintains myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. Walker et al. show that during human labor, EP2 signaling switches toward an inflammatory profile driven by functional crosstalk with the activated oxytocin receptor. An EP2 ligand, PGN9856i, is “resistant” to this crosstalk and could be exploited to delay preterm labor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proton-transporting heliorhodopsins from marine giant viruses</a></h4>

              
                Rhodopsins convert light into signals and energy in animals and microbes. Heliorhodopsins (HeRs), a recently discovered new rhodopsin family, are widely present in archaea, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and giant viruses, but their function remains unknown. Here, we report that a viral HeR from Emiliania huxleyi virus 202 (V2HeR3) is a light-activated proton transporter. V2HeR3 absorbs blue-green light, and the active intermediate contains the deprotonated retinal Schiff base. Site-directed mutagenesis study revealed that E191 in TM6 constitutes the gate together with the retinal Schiff base. E205 and E215 form a PAG of the Schiff base, and mutations at these positions converted the protein into an outward proton pump. Three environmental viral HeRs from the same group as well as a more distantly related HeR exhibited similar proton-transport activity, indicating that HeR functions might be diverse similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins. Some strains of <i>E. huxleyi</i> contain one HeR that is related to the viral HeRs, while its viruses <i>Eh</i>V-201 and <i>Eh</i>V-202 contain two and three HeRs, respectively. Except for V2HeR3 from <i>Eh</i>V-202, none of these proteins exhibit ion transport activity. Thus, when expressed in the <i>E. huxleyi</i> cell membranes, only V2HeR3 has the potential to depolarize the host cells by light, possibly to overcome the host defense mechanisms or to prevent superinfection. The neuronal activity generated by V2HeR3 suggests that it can potentially be used as an optogenetic tool, similarly to type-1 microbial rhodopsins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural model of microtubule dynamics inhibition by kinesin-4 from the crystal structure of KLP-12 –tubulin complex</a></h4>

              
                Kinesin superfamily proteins are microtubule-based molecular motors driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Among them, the kinesin-4 family is a unique motor that inhibits microtubule dynamics. Although mutations of kinesin-4 cause several diseases, its molecular mechanism is unclear because of the difficulty of visualizing the high-resolution structure of kinesin-4 working at the microtubule plus-end. Here, we report that KLP-12, a <i>C. elegans</i> kinesin-4 ortholog of KIF21A and KIF21B, is essential for proper length control of <i>C. elegans</i> axons, and its motor domain represses microtubule polymerization in vitro. The crystal structure of the KLP-12 motor domain complexed with tubulin, which represents the high-resolution structural snapshot of the inhibition state of microtubule-end dynamics, revealed the bending effect of KLP-12 for tubulin. Comparison with the KIF5B-tubulin and KIF2C-tubulin complexes, which represent the elongation and shrinking forms of microtubule ends, respectively, showed the curvature of tubulin introduced by KLP-12 is in between them. Taken together, KLP-12 controls the proper length of axons by modulating the curvature of the microtubule ends to inhibit the microtubule dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Machine learning-assisted fluoroscopy of bladder function in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the lower urinary tract (LUT) and development of highly needed novel therapies to treat LUT disorders depends on accurate techniques to monitor LUT (dys)function in preclinical models. We recently developed videocystometry in rodents, which combines intravesical pressure measurements with X-ray-based fluoroscopy of the LUT, allowing the <i>in vivo</i> analysis of the process of urine storage and voiding with unprecedented detail. Videocystometry relies on the precise contrast-based determination of the bladder volume at high temporal resolution, which can readily be achieved in anesthetized or otherwise motion-restricted mice but not in awake and freely moving animals. To overcome this limitation, we developed a machine-learning method, in which we trained a neural network to automatically detect the bladder in fluoroscopic images, allowing the automatic analysis of bladder filling and voiding cycles based on large sets of time-lapse fluoroscopic images (&gt;3 hours at 30 images/second) from behaving mice and in a non-invasive manner. With this approach, we found that urethane, an injectable anesthetic that is commonly used in preclinical urological research, has a profound, dose-dependent effect on urethral relaxation and voiding duration. Moreover, both in awake and in anaesthetized mice, the bladder capacity was decreased ~4-fold when cystometry was performed acutely after surgical implantation of a suprapubic catheter. Our findings provide a paradigm for the non-invasive, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of a hollow organ in behaving animals and pinpoint important limitations of the current gold standard techniques to study the LUT in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mental health in medical and biomedical doctoral students during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests</a></h4>

              
                Concerns about the mental health of students, trainees and staff at universities and medical schools have been growing for many years. Recently, these have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and a period of heightened reckoning and protests about systemic racism in the United States in 2020. To better understand the mental health of medical students and biomedical doctoral students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during this challenging period, we performed a cross-sectional study (n=957) using institutional annual survey data on measures of depression, anxiety, hazardous alcohol use, problems related to substance use, and suicidal ideation. These data were collected in 2019 and 2020, and were analyzed by type of training program, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and survey year. Results indicated significant differences for rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, with biomedical doctoral students showing greater incidence than medical students, and historically excluded students (e.g., people of color, women, LGBQ+ trainees) showing greater incidence compared to their peers. Of note, mental health remained poor for biomedical doctoral students in 2020 and declined for those belonging to historically excluded populations. The high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported suggest that training environments need to be improved and support for mental health increased.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A crosstalk between hepcidin and IRE/IRP pathways controls ferroportin expression and determines serum iron levels in mice</a></h4>

              
                The iron hormone hepcidin is transcriptionally activated by iron or inflammation via distinct, partially overlapping pathways. We addressed how iron affects inflammatory hepcidin levels and the ensuing hypoferremic response. Dietary iron overload did not mitigate hepcidin induction in LPS-treated wt mice but prevented effective inflammatory hypoferremia. Likewise, LPS modestly decreased serum iron in hepcidin-deficient <i>Hjv-/-</i> mice, model of hemochromatosis. Synthetic hepcidin triggered hypoferremia in control but not iron-loaded wt animals. Furthermore, it dramatically decreased hepatic and splenic ferroportin in <i>Hjv-/-</i> mice on standard or iron-deficient diet, but only triggered hypoferremia in the latter. Mechanistically, iron antagonized hepcidin responsiveness by inactivating IRPs in the liver and spleen, to stimulate ferroportin mRNA translation. Prolonged LPS treatment eliminating ferroportin mRNA permitted hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia in iron-loaded mice. Thus, <i>de novo</i> ferroportin synthesis is critical determinant of serum iron and finetunes hepcidin-dependent functional outcomes. Our data uncover a crosstalk between hepcidin and IRE/IRP systems that controls tissue ferroportin expression and determines serum iron levels. Moreover, they suggest that hepcidin supplementation therapy is more efficient combined with iron depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Recovering mixtures of fast-diffusing states from short single-particle trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Single-particle tracking (SPT) directly measures the dynamics of proteins in living cells and is a powerful tool to dissect molecular mechanisms of cellular regulation. Interpretation of SPT with fast-diffusing proteins in mammalian cells, however, is complicated by technical limitations imposed by fast image acquisition. These limitations include short trajectory length due to photobleaching and shallow depth of field, high localization error due to the low photon budget imposed by short integration times, and cell-to-cell variability. To address these issues, we investigated methods inspired by Bayesian nonparametrics to infer distributions of state parameters from SPT data with short trajectories, variable localization precision, and absence of prior knowledge about the number of underlying states. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other frameworks for SPT analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A specific role for Importin-5 and NASP in the import and nuclear hand-off of monomeric H3</a></h4>

              
                Core histones package chromosomal DNA and regulate genomic transactions, with their nuclear import and deposition involving importin- proteins and a dedicated repertoire of histone chaperones. Previously, a histone H3-H4 dimer has been isolated bound to Importin-4 (Imp4) and the chaperone ASF1, suggesting H3 and H4 fold together in the cytoplasm before nuclear import. However, other studies have shown the existence of monomeric H3 in the nucleus, indicating a post import folding pathway. Here we report that the predominant importin associated with cytoplasmic H3 is Importin-5 (Imp5), which hands off its monomeric cargo to nuclear sNASP. Imp5, in contrast to Imp4, binds to both H3 and H4 containing constitutively monomeric mutations and binds to newly synthesised, monomeric H3 tethered in the cytoplasm. Constitutively monomeric H3 retains its interaction with NASP, whereas monomeric H4 retains interactions specifically with HAT1 and RBBP7. High-resolution separation of NASP interactors shows the 's' isoform but not the 't' isoform associates with monomeric H3, whilst both isoforms associate with H3-H4 dimers in at least three discrete multi-chaperoning complexes. In vitro binding experiments show mutual exclusivity between sNASP and Imp5 in binding H3, suggesting direct competition for interaction sites, with the GTP-bound form of Ran required for histone transfer. Finally, using pulse-chase analysis, we show that cytoplasm tethered histones do not interact with endogenous NASP until they reach the nucleus, whereupon they bind rapidly. We propose an Imp5-specific import pathway for monomeric H3 that hands off to sNASP in the nucleus, with a parallel H4 pathway involving Imp5 and the HAT1-RBBP7 complex, followed by nuclear folding and hand-off to deposition factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CRISPR screens in 3D assembloids reveal disease genes associated with human interneuron development</a></h4>

              
                The assembly of cortical circuits involves the generation and migration of cortical interneurons from the ventral to the dorsal forebrain, which has been challenging to study in humans as these processes take place at inaccessible stages of late gestation and early postnatal development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been associated with abnormal cortical interneuron development, but which of the hundreds of NDD genes impact interneuron generation and migration into circuits and how they mediate these effects remain unknown. We previously developed a stem cell-based platform to study human cortical interneurons in self-organizing organoids resembling the ventral forebrain and their migration using forebrain assembloids. Here, we integrate assembloid technology with CRISPR screening to systematically investigate the involvement of 425 NDD genes in human interneuron development. The first screen aimed at interneuron generation revealed 13 candidate genes, including the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 and the canonical TGF{beta} signaling activator SMAD4. Then, we ran an interneuron migration screen in ~1,000 forebrain assembloids that identified 33 candidate genes, including cytoskeleton-related genes and, notably, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related gene LNPK. Interestingly, we discovered that, during interneuron migration, the ER is displaced along the leading neuronal branch prior to nuclear translocation. Deletion of LNPK interfered with this ER displacement and resulted in reduced interneuron saltation length, indicating a critical role for the ER in this migratory process. Taken together, these results highlight how this versatile CRISPR-assembloid platform can be used to systematically map disease genes onto early stages of human neural development and to reveal novel mechanisms regulating interneuron development.

                Hypertension, a disease afflicting over one billion individuals worldwide, is a leading cause of cognitive impairment, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. In a mouse model of hypertension involving brain angiotensin signaling, we found that the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction depends on IL-17, a cytokine elevated in the circulation of hypertensive individuals. However, neither circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling could account in full for the dysfunction. Rather, IL-17 produced by meningeal T-cells was the major culprit by activating IL-17 receptors on brain associated macrophages. Accordingly, depleting brain macrophages or suppressing meningeal T cells completely rescued cognitive function without attenuating blood pressure elevation, circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling. The data unveil a critical role of meningeal T-cells and macrophage IL-17 signaling in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction of hypertension and suggest novel therapies to counteract the devastating effects of hypertension on cognitive health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep spindle maturation enhances slow oscillation-spindle coupling</a></h4>

              
                The synchronization of canonical fast sleep spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) precisely during the slow oscillation up peak is considered an essential feature of adult non-rapid eye movement sleep. However, there is little knowledge on how this well-known coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops. Leveraging individualized detection of single events, we first provide a detailed cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling in children aged 5 to 6, 8 to 11, and 14 to 18 years. Critically, based on this, we then investigated how spindle and slow oscillation maturity substantiate age differences in their precise orchestration. While the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the canonical (adult-like) fast spindle range in all three age groups - but notably less precise in children. To corroborate these findings, we linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Importantly, we found that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and precision. Taken together, our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns across child and adolescent development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The amyloid precursor protein regulates synaptic transmission at medial perforant path synapses</a></h4>

              
                The perforant path provides the main cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Due to its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, a characterization of synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells is still pending. Here, we have used organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures, in which the entorhino-dentate (EC-GC) projection is present and EC-GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Using cultures of wildtype mice, the properties of EC-GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared and differences in short-term plasticity were revealed. Since the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used cultures of APP-deficient mice to address the role of the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) at this synapse. APP-deficiency caused alterations in excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses that were accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, the deletion of pre- but not postsynaptic APP through the local injection of Cre-expressing AAVs in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the efficacy of neurotransmission at perforant path synapses. Together, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses, which may be adversely affected under conditions of altered APP processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity in the human superior colliculus associated with reaching for tactile targets</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus (SC) plays a major role in orienting movements of eyes and the head and in the allocation of attention. Functions of the SC have been mostly investigated in animal models, including non-human primates. Differences in the SC's anatomy and function between different species question extrapolations of these studies to humans without further validation. Few electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in animal models and humans have reported an unexpected role of the SC in visually guided reaching movements. Using BOLD fMRI imaging, We sought to decipher if the SC is also active during reaching movements guided by tactile stimulation. Participants executed reaching movements to visual or tactile target positions. When contrasted against visual and tactile stimulation without reaching, we found increased SC activity in correlation with reaching for both stimulus modalities. In agreement with previous studies across various species, we conclude that the SC is involved in the execution of reaching movements. Beyond a confirmation for visually guided reaching, our results showed that this involvement is independent from a specific sensory modality informing such movements and suggest a general involvement of the human SC in upper limb reaching movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural cognitive signals during spontaneous movements in the macaque</a></h4>

              
                The single neuron basis of cognitive processing in primates has mostly been studied in laboratory settings where movements are severely restricted. It is unclear, therefore, how natural movements might affect neural signatures of cognition in the brain. Moreover, studies in mice indicate that body movements, when measured, account for most of the neural dynamics in the cortex. To examine this issue, we recorded from single neuron ensembles in the prefrontal cortex in moving monkeys performing a cognitive task and characterized eyes, head, and body movements using video tracking. Despite significant trial-to-trial movement variability, single neuron tuning could be precisely measured and decision signals accurately decoded on a single-trial basis. Creating or abolishing spontaneous movements through head restraint and task manipulations had no measurable impact on neural responses. However, encoding models showed that uninstructed movements explained as much neural variance as task variables, with most of them aligned to task events. These results demonstrate that cognitive signals in the cortex are robust to natural movements, but also that unmeasured movements are potential confounds in cognitive neurophysiology experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter structural bases for predictive tapping synchronization</a></h4>

              
                We determined the intersubject association between rhythmic entrainment abilities of human subjects during a synchronization continuation tapping task (SCT) and the macro and microstructural properties of their superficial (SWM) and deep (dWM) white matter. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained from 32 subjects who also performed the SCT with auditory or visual metronomes and five tempos ranging from 550 to 950 ms. We developed a method to determine the fiber density of U-fibers running tangentially to the cortex. Notably, the right audiomotor system showed individual differences in the density of U-fibers that were correlated with the degree of predictive entrainment across subjects. These correlations were selective for the synchronization epoch with auditory metronomes and were specific for tempos around 1.5 Hz. In addition, there was a significant association between predictive rhythmic entrainment and the density and bundle diameter of the corpus callosum (CC), forming a chronotopic map where behavioural correlations of short and long intervals were found with the anterior and posterior portions of the CC. Finally, the fiber bundle cross-section of the arcuate fasciculus, the CC, and the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus showed a significant correlation with the mean asynchronies of the auditory SCT. These findings suggest that the structural properties of the SWM and dWM in the audiomotor system support the predictive abilities of subjects during rhythmic tapping, where the density of cortical U-fibers are linked to the preferred tapping tempo, while the bundle properties of CC define an interval selective topography that has an anterior posterior gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The history of multisensory discrepancies affects the ventriloquism effect and the immediate aftereffect differentially.</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration and recalibration are two processes by which perception deals with discrepant multisensory signals. In the lab, integration can be probed via the presentation of simultaneous spatially discrepant audio-visual stimuli, i.e. in a spatial ventriloquism paradigm. Recalibration here manifests as an aftereffect bias in unisensory judgements following immediate or long-term exposure to discrepant audio-visual stimuli. Despite many studies exploring the ventriloquism effect (VE) and the immediate aftereffect (VAE), it remains unclear whether the VAE is a direct consequence of the integration of preceding discrepant multisensory signals. We here provide evidence that these two biases are not strictly related. First, we analysed data from ten experiments probing the dependence of each bias on audio-visual discrepancies experienced in multiple preceding trials. This revealed a seven-fold stronger dependence of the VAE on preceding discrepancies compared to the VE. Second, we analysed data from an experiment deviating from the typical trial context in which these biases are probed and found that the VAE can vanish despite the VE being present. We argue that integration may help maintaining a stable percept by reducing immediate sensory discrepancies, whereas recalibration may help maintaining an accurate percept by accounting for consistent discrepancies. Hence, the immediate VAE is not a direct and necessary consequence of the integration of discrepant signals and these two well-studied multisensory response biases can be experimentally dissociated.

                The functional neurological outcome of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) strongly relates to the degree of secondary brain injury (ICH SBI) evolving within days after the initial bleeding. Different mechanisms including the incitement of inflammatory pathways, dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (BBB), activation of resident microglia, and an influx of blood-borne immune cells, have been hypothesized to contribute to ICH SBI. Yet, the spatiotemporal interplay of specific inflammatory processes within different brain compartments has not been sufficiently characterized, limiting potential therapeutic interventions to prevent and treat ICH SBI. Using a whole-blood injection model in mice, we systematically characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes after ICH using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spatial RNA sequencing (spRNAseq), functional BBB assessment, and immunofluorescence average intensity mapping. We identified a pronounced early response of the choroid plexus (CP) peaking at 12 to 24h, that was characterized by inflammatory cytokine expression, epithelial and endothelial expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and the accumulation of leukocytes. In contrast, we observed a delayed secondary reaction pattern at the injection site (striatum) peaking at 96h, defined by gene expression corresponding to perilesional leukocyte infiltration and correlating to the delayed signal alteration seen on MRI. Pathway analysis revealed a dependence of the early inflammatory reaction in the CP on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). TLR4 and MyD88 knockout mice corroborated this observation, lacking the early upregulation of adhesion molecules and leukocyte infiltration within the CP 24h after whole-blood injection. In conclusion, we report a biphasic brain reaction pattern after ICH with a MyD88 TLR4 dependent early inflammatory response of the CP, preceding inflammation, edema and leukocyte infiltration at the lesion site. Pharmacological targeting of the early CP activation might harbor the potential to modulate the development of ICH SBI.

                Background: Despite successful recanalization to treat acute ischemic stroke, reperfusion failure associated with poor functional outcomes develops in half of the patients. The cause of reperfusion failure remains the subject of intensive research. Here, we explore the possibility that spreading depolarization (SD), a potent ischemic injury mechanism is a significant contributor and reliable predictor of reperfusion failure. Methods: Young adult male and female C57BL/6 mice (n=69) were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.6-0.9%) and prepared for transcranial optical imaging. After 10 min of baseline, incomplete global forebrain ischemia was induced by transient (45 min) bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion, followed by 75 min reperfusion. SD and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were visualized with intrinsic optical signal imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging. To block SD, the irreversible NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 was applied (0.3 mg/kg, i.p., n=29). Neurological deficit was evaluated at baseline and post-ischemia with a composite Garcia Neuroscore scale. Collaterals of the circle of Willis were examined after loading the vasculature with carbon black ink. Ischemic neuronal injury was evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections. Results: SD emerged after ischemia onset in one or both hemispheres under a perfusion threshold (CBF drop to 21.1+-4.6 vs. 33.6+-4.4 %, SD vs. no SD). The failure of later reperfusion (44.4+-12.5 %) was invariably linked to previous ischemic SD. In contrast, reperfusion was adequate (98.9+-7.4 %) in hemispheres devoid of SD during ischemia. CBF reduced below the perfusion threshold of SD, when the P1 segment was absent in the circle of Willis. SD occurrence and the linked reperfusion failure were associated with poor neurologic function, and greater neuronal necrosis. The inhibition of SD with MK801 significantly improved reperfusion. Conclusions: SD occurrence during ischemia impairs later reperfusion, prognosticating poor functional outcomes. The increased likelihood of SD occurrence is predicted by inadequate collaterals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-Echo Investigations of Positive and Negative CBF and Concomitant BOLD Changes</a></h4>

              
                Unlike the positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response (PBR), commonly taken as an indication of an 'activated' brain region, the physiological origin of negative BOLD signal changes (i.e. a negative BOLD response, NBR), also referred to as 'deactivation' is still being debated. In this work, an attempt was made to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanism by obtaining a comprehensive measure of the contributing cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its relationship to the NBR in the human visual cortex, in comparison to a simultaneously induced PBR in surrounding visual regions. To overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CBF measurements, a newly developed multi-echo version of a center-out echo planar-imaging (EPI) readout was employed with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). It achieved very short echo and inter-echo times and facilitated a simultaneous detection of functional CBF and BOLD changes at 3 T with improved sensitivity. Evaluations of the absolute and relative changes of CBF and the effective transverse relaxation rate, R2*, the coupling ratios, and their dependence on CBF at rest, CBFrest, indicated differences between activated and deactivated regions. Analysis of the shape of the respective functional responses also revealed faster negative responses with more pronounced post-stimulus transients. Resulting differences in the flow-metabolism coupling ratios were further examined for potential distinctions in the underlying neuronal contributions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NUDT6, the Antisense Protein of FGF2 Gene, Plays a Depressogenic Role by Promoting Inflammation and Suppressing Neurogenesis without Altering FGF2 Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is involved in the regulation of affective behavior and shows antidepressant effects through Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. NUDT6 is a protein encoded from the antisense strand of the FGF2 gene and its role in the regulation of affective behavior is unclear. Here, we show that increasing NUDT6 expression in the hippocampus results in depression-like behavior in rats without changing FGF2 levels or activating its downstream effectors, Akt and ERK1/2. Instead, NUDT6 acts by inducing inflammatory signaling, specifically by increasing S100A9 levels, activating NF-kB, and rising microglia number along with a reduction in neurogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of hippocampal NUDT6 expression by shRNA results in antidepressant effects and increases neurogenesis without altering FGF2 levels. Together these findings suggest that NUDT6 may play a role in major depression by inducing a proinflammatory state and serve as a novel therapeutic target for antidepressant development. The opposite effects of NUDT6 and FGF2 on depression-like behavior may serve as a mechanism to fine-tune affective behavior. Our findings open up new venues for studying the differential regulation and functional interactions of sense and antisense proteins in neural function and behavior as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Cell membranes and macromolecules or paramagnetic compounds interact with water proton spins, which modulates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast providing information on tissue composition. For a further investigation, quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters (at 3T), including the ratio of the macromolecular and water proton pools, F, and the exchange-rate constant as well as the (observed) longitudinal and the effective transverse relaxation rates (at 3T and 7T), R1obs and R2*, respectively, were measured at high spatial resolution (200 m) in a slice of fixed marmoset brain and compared to histology results obtained with Gallyas' myelin stain and Perls' iron stain. R1obs and R2* were linearly correlated with the iron content for the entire slice, whereas distinct differences were obtained between gray and white matter for correlations of relaxometry and qMT parameters with myelin content. The combined results suggest that the macromolecular pool interacting with water consists of myelin and (less efficient) non-myelin contributions. Despite strong correlation of F and R1obs, none of these parameters was uniquely specific to myelination. Due to additional sensitivity to iron stores, R1obs and R2* were more sensitive for depicting microstructural differences between cortical layers than F.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-generated brain-wide spiking cascades govern replay dynamics in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                During states of behavioral quiescence, neurons in the hippocampus replay sequences of spiking activity experienced in earlier behavioral episodes. While such replay sequences are hypothesized to serve learning and memory by facilitating synaptic consolidation, their generative mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that they might be generated internally, or at least strongly constrained by internal circuit dynamics. Recent work demonstrated that, across the forebrain, approximately 70% of neurons participate in a pattern of sequential spiking cascades during rest. Like hippocampal replay sequences, these brain-wide spiking cascades occur together with high-frequency hippocampal ripples and therefore may share a common generative mechanism. Here we systematically investigated the relationship between replay activity and sequential spiking cascades by analyzing a database of intracortical electrocortical recordings in mice. For neuronal subpopulations in the hippocampus and visual cortex, we assessed spiking sequences elicited during video viewing as well as potential replay events during subsequent periods of rest. We found that replay events were unique to hippocampal time-sensitive neurons and occurred together with spiking cascades throughout the forebrain. Furthermore, forward and time-reversed replay sequences were associated with different types of spiking cascades. Overall, these findings indicate that hippocampal replay events are generated and structured according to resting state circuit dynamics manifest across a large portion of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogen signaling in the dorsal raphe regulates binge-like drinking in mice</a></h4>

              
                The ovarian hormone estrogens promote binge alcohol drinking and contribute to sex differences in alcohol use disorder. However, the mechanisms for estrogen-induced binge drinking are largely unknown. This study aims to test if estrogens act on 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HTDRN) to promote binge drinking. We used the drinking in the dark (DID) behavioral test in mice to mimic binge drinking in humans. We found that female mice drank more alcohol than male mice in chronic DID tests. This sex difference was associated with distinct alterations in mRNA expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and 5-HT-related genes in the DRN, suggesting a potential role of estrogen/ERs/5-HT signaling in binge alcohol drinking. In supporting this view, 5-HTDRN neurons from naive male mice had lower baseline neuronal firing activity but higher sensitivity to alcohol-induced excitation compared to 5-HTDRN neurons from naive female mice. Notably, this higher sensitivity was blunted by 17bata-estradiol treatment in males, indicating an estrogen-dependent mechanism. We further showed that both ERalpha and ERbeta are expressed in 5-HTDRN neurons, whereas ERalpha agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) depolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons and ERbeta agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) hyperpolarizes 5-HTDRN neurons. Notably, both PPT and DPN treatments blocked the stimulatory effects of alcohol on 5-HTDRN neurons in males, despite the fact that they have antagonistic effects on the activity dynamics of 5-HTDRN neurons. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of ERs on ethanol-induced burst firing of 5-HTDRN neurons may contribute to higher levels of binge drinking in females. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of ERalpha- or ERbeta-expressing neurons in the DRN reduced binge alcohol drinking. These results support a model in which estrogens act on ERalpha/beta to prevent alcohol-induced activation of 5-HTDRN neurons, which in return leads to higher binge alcohol drinking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RNA-deficient TDP-43 causes loss of free nuclear TDP-43 by sequestration</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction and aggregation of the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the unifying hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanisms and relative contributions of concurrent TDP-43 nuclear depletion, cytoplasmic accumulation, and post-translational modification to neurodegeneration remain unresolved. We employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated fluorescent tagging to investigate how disease-associated stressors and pathological TDP-43 alter abundance, localisation, self-assembly, aggregation, solubility, and mobility dynamics of endogenous TDP-43 over time. Oxidative stress stimulated TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation into droplets or spherical shell-like 'anisosomes', which were not formed by over-expressed wild-type TDP-43. Further, nuclear RNA-binding-ablated or acetylation-mimicking TDP-43 rapidly formed anisosomes and inclusions that readily sequestered and depleted free normal nuclear TDP-43. The majority of total endogenous TDP-43 was sequestered into anisosomes, but retained high protein mobility and solubility. However, cytoplasmic RNA-deficient TDP-43 formed large phosphorylated inclusions that occasionally sequestered endogenous TDP-43, rendering it insoluble and immobile, indicating irreversible pathological transition. These findings suggest that post-translational modification and RNA-binding deficiency exacerbate TDP-43 aggregation and dysfunction by driving sequestration, mislocalisation, and depletion of normal nuclear TDP-43 in ALS and FTD.

                Motion is one of the fundamental qualities not only of vision, but also of touch. Manipulation and exploration of objects involves different forms of movement between the skin and object. A different form of tactile motion from remote sources is through substrate vibrations, and is present in arthropods such as insects and spiders, enabling them to localise approaching preys and predators. Here, we quantify the extent to humans perceive motion based on vibrations sensed at fingertips. We employed a novel stimulation paradigm in which a pair of vibrations (100 Hz) with sinusoidal envelopes (0.5 cycle/s) and various phase differences between the two vibrations were delivered to two fingertips. The phase difference generated the perception of a virtual motion across the fingertips. The findings suggest that human tactile system possesses the sensory channel for detection of motion through substrate vibrations, which is fundamentally different from active surface exploration mechanisms. We propose two potential neural computations underlying processing this form of motion; one based on phase difference detection, and the second based on temporal interval duration processing.

                Striatal dysfunction is a key characteristic of addictive disorders, but neuroimaging studies have reported conflicting findings. An integrative model of addiction points to the presence or absence of addiction-related cues as an explanation for striatal hypo- or hyperactivations, respectively, but has never been directly tested. Here, we developed a novel paradigm to investigate striatal activation during monetary reward anticipation in the presence versus absence of addiction-related pictures using functional MRI. Across two studies, we compared 46 alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients with 30 matched healthy controls; and 24 gambling disorder (GD) patients with 22 matched healthy controls. During monetary reward anticipation, hypoactivation of the reward system was seen in AUD individuals compared to HCs. Additionally, a behavioral interaction was seen where gambling cues made participants, across groups, respond faster for bigger, but slower for smaller rewards. However, no striatal differences were seen between the participants with AUD or GD and their matched controls. In sum, these findings suggest that striatal dysfunction is a key but heterogeneous mechanism within both AUD and GD and indicates an important but complex role for addiction-related cues in explaining striatal dysfunction in addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Tripod neuron: a minimal structural reduction of the dendritic tree</a></h4>

              
                Neuron models with explicit dendritic dynamics have shed light on mechanisms for coincidence detection, pathway selection, and temporal filtering. However, it is still unclear which morphological and physiological features are required to capture these phenomena. In this work, we introduce the Tripod neuron model and propose a minimal structural reduction of the dendritic tree that is able to reproduce these dendritic computations. The Tripod is a three-compartment model consisting of two segregated passive dendrites and a somatic compartment modeled as an adaptive, exponential integrate-and-fire neuron. It incorporates dendritic geometry, membrane physiology, and receptor dynamics as measured in human pyramidal cells. We characterize the response of the Tripod to glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs and identify parameters that support supra-linear integration, coincidence-detection, and pathway-specific gating through shunting inhibition. Following NMDA spikes, the Tripod neuron generates plateau potentials whose duration depends on the dendritic length and the strength of synaptic input. When fitted with distal compartments, the Tripod neuron encodes previous activity into a dendritic depolarized state. This dendritic memory allows the neuron to perform temporal binding and we show that the neuron solves transition and sequence detection tasks on which a single-compartment model fails. Thus, the Tripod neuron can account for dendritic computations previously explained only with more detailed neuron models or neural networks. Due to its simplicity, the Tripod model can be used efficiently in simulations of larger cortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metamodelling of a two-population spiking neural network</a></h4>

              
                In computational neuroscience, hypotheses are often formulated as bottom-up mechanistic models of the systems in question, consisting of differential equations that can be numerically integrated forward in time. Candidate models can then be validated by comparison against experimental data. The model outputs of neural network models depend on both neuron parameters, connectivity parameters and other model inputs. Successful model fitting requires sufficient exploration of the model parameter space, which can be computationally demanding. Additionally, identifying degeneracy in the parameters, i.e. different combinations of parameter values that produce similar outputs, is of interest, as they define the subset of models consistent with the data. In this computational study, we apply metamodels to a two-population recurrent spiking network of point-neurons, the so-called Brunel network. Metamodels are data-driven approximations to more complex models with more desirable computational properties, which can be run considerably faster than the original model. Specifically, we apply two different metamodelling techniques, Hierarchical Cluster-based Partial Least Squares regression and deep Gaussian process regression, to estimate the power spectra of the population spiking activities and the local field potential. We find that the metamodels are able to accurately model the power spectra in the asynchronous irregular regime. Using the Gaussian process metamodel, we invert the model, and estimate the probability distributions over parameters that can give rise to observed simulation outputs. We find that these distributions correctly identify parameter combinations that give similar model outputs, and that the parameters are constrained to different degrees by observing the two different signals.

                Recent development in implantable devices for electrical brain stimulation includes sensing and embedded computing capabilities that enable adaptive stimulation strategies. Applications include stimulation triggered by pathologic brain activity and endogenous rhythms, such as circadian rhythms. We developed and tested a system that integrates an electrical brain stimulation & sensing implantable device with embedded computing and uses a distributed system with commercial electronics, smartphone and smartwatch for patient annotations, extensive behavioral testing, and adaptive stimulation in subjects in their natural environments. The system enables precise time synchronization of the external components with the brain stimulating device and is coupled with automated analysis of continuous streaming electrophysiology synchronized with patient reports. The system leverages a real-time bi-directional interface between devices and patients with epilepsy living in their natural environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metaplasticity: Dark exposure boosts excitability and visual plasticity in adult human cortex</a></h4>

              
                An interlude of dark exposure for about one week is known to shift the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance of the mammalian visual cortex, promoting cortical plasticity across species and accelerating visual recovery of those that have experienced cortical lesions during development. However, the translational impact of our understanding of dark exposure from animal studies on humans remains elusive. Here, we use magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a probe for E/I balance in the primary visual cortex (V1) to determine the effect of 60-min dark exposure, and measure binocular combination as a behavioral assay to assess visual plasticity in 18 normally sighted adults (13 females). To induce neuroplastic changes in the observers, 60-min monocular deprivation was performed, which is known to shift sensory eye balance in favor of the previously deprived eye. We report that dark exposure strengthens cortical excitability in V1 and boosts visually plasticity in normal adults. Our findings are surprising, given the fact that the interlude is at a very brief timescale. We present direct evidence that an environmental manipulation that reduces intracortical inhibition can as a metaplastic facilitator for visual plasticity in adult humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Erotic cue exposure increases physiological arousal, biases choices towards immediate rewards and attenuates model-based reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Computational psychiatry focuses on identifying core cognitive processes that appear altered across a broad range of psychiatric disorders. Temporal discounting of future rewards and model-based control during reinforcement learning have proven as two promising candidates. Despite its trait-like stability, temporal discounting has been suggested to be at least partly under contextual control. For example, highly arousing cues such as erotic pictures were shown to increase discounting, although overall evidence to date remains somewhat mixed. Whether model-based reinforcement learning is similarly affected by arousing cues is unclear. Here we tested cue-reactivity effects (erotic pictures) on subsequent temporal discounting and model-based reinforcement learning in a within-subjects design in n=39 healthy male participants. Self-reported and physiological arousal (cardiac activity and pupil dilation) were assessed before and during cue exposure. Arousal was increased during exposure of erotic vs. neutral cues both on the subjective and autonomic level. Erotic cue exposure nominally increased discounting as reflected by reduced choices of delayed options. Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (DDM) linked increased discounting to a shift in the starting point bias of evidence accumulation towards immediate options. Model-based control during reinforcement learning was reduced following erotic cues according to model-agnostic analysis. Notably, DDM linked this effect to attenuated forgetting rates of unchosen options, leaving the model-based control parameter unchanged. Our findings replicate previous work on cue-reactivity effects in temporal discounting and for the first time show similar effects in model-based reinforcement learning. Our results highlight how environmental cues can impact core human decision processes and reveal that comprehensive drift diffusion modeling approaches can yield novel insights in reward-based decision processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Graded optogenetic activation of the auditory pathway for neural network analysis and hearing restoration</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic control of neural activity enables causal investigation of neural circuits and new perspectives in sensory restoration. Optimal design of the experiment needs to match the optogenetic technology to the precise neural circuit and research question. This often precludes out-of-the-box solutions and require users to thorough characterize the neural response and to tailor the optogenetic tools. Here, we provide a framework to parametrize optogenetic control at the single and population levels and apply it, in mice, to the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) that form the input stage of the auditory pathway. We employed the ultrafast targeting-optimized Chronos and characterized the light-evoked response by in vivo single-unit recordings in SGNs and neurons of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) that detect coincident SGN input. We demonstrate that spike probability can be gradually dialed by adjusting the width of light pulses like what can be achieved with acoustic clicks of different sound pressure levels. We identified an optimal pulse width of 1.6 ms for maximizing the amount of light intensity information in the spike trains. Further, we identified a spike failure induced during high rate optical stimulation that likely was due to depolarization block and required a few tens of milliseconds to recover. Finally, a semi-stochastic stimulus allowed us to rapidly (within minutes) establish the transfer function from light to SGNs firing and to generate firing of different statistics for approximating the time constant of neuronal integration in AVCN neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">4.1N and SAP97 regulate different phases of AMPA receptor intracellular transport</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the number of synaptic AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptors (AMPAR) underlie many forms of synaptic plasticity. These variations are controlled by a complex interplay between their intracellular transport (IT), export to the plasma membrane, stabilization at synaptic sites, and recycling. The differential molecular mechanisms involved in these various trafficking pathways and their regulation remains partly unknown. We have recently reported the visualization of AMPAR IT in cultured hippocampal neurons and demonstrated its regulation during synaptic plasticity inducing protocols (Hangen, Cordelieres et al., 2018), opening the path to the differential analysis of the mechanisms controlling AMPAR transport and exocytosis. The cytosolic C-terminal (C-ter.) domain of AMPAR GluA1 subunit is specifically associated with cytoplasmic proteins that could be implicated in the regulation of their IT such as 4.1N and SAP97. Here we analyze how interactions between GluA1 and 4.1N or SAP97 regulate IT and exocytosis at the plasma membrane in basal condition and after cLTP induction. We use sh-RNA against 4.1N and SAP97 and specific mutations and deletions of GluA1 C-ter. domain to characterize how these interactions are involved in coupling AMPAR to the transport machinery. The down-regulation of both 4.1N or SAP97 by shRNAs decrease GluA1 containing vesicle number, modify their transport properties and decrease GluA1 export to the PM, indicating their role in GluA1 IT. The total deletion of the C-ter. domain of GluA1 fully suppresses its IT. Disruption of GluA1 binding to 4.1N decreases the number of GluA1 containing transport vesicles, inhibits GluA1 externalization but does not affect the transport properties of the remaining GluA1 containing vesicles. This indicates a role of the 4.1N GluA1 interaction during exocytosis of the receptor in basal transmission. In contrast, disrupting the binding between SAP97 and GluA1 modifies the basal transport properties of GluA1 containing vesicles and decreases GluA1 export to the plasma membrane. Importantly, disrupting GluA1 interaction with either 4.1N or SAP97 prevents both the cLTP induced increase in the number of GluA1 containing vesicles observed in control and GluA1 externalization. Our results demonstrate that specific interactions between 4.1N or SAP97 with GluA1 have different roles in GluA1 IT and exocytosis. During basal transmission, the binding of 4.1N to GluA1 allows the fusion/fission membrane exocytosis whereas the interaction with SAP97 is essential for GluA1 IT. During cLTP the interaction of 4.1N with GluA1 allows both IT and exocytosis of the receptor in hippocampal cultured neurons. Altogether, our results identify the differential roles of 4.1N and SAP97 in the control of various phases of GluA1 IT.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping of Glutamate Metabolism using 1H FID-MRSI after oral Administration of Glc at 9.4 T</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the brain and malfunction of the related metabolism is associated with various neurological diseases and disorders. The observation of labeling changes in the spectra after the administration of a 13C labelled tracer is a common tool to gain better insights into the function of the metabolic system. But so far, only a very few studies presenting the labelling effects in more than two voxels to show the spatial dependence of metabolism. In the present work, the labeling effects were measured in a transversal plane in the human brain using ultra-short TE and TR 1H FID-MRSI. The measurement set-up was most simple: The [1-13C]Glc was administered orally instead of intravenous and the spectra were measured with a pure 1H technique without the need of a 13C channel (as Boumezbeur et al. demonstrated in 2004). Thus, metabolic maps and enrichment curves could be obtained for more metabolites and in more voxels than ever before in human brain. Labeling changes could be observed in [4-13C]glutamate, [3-13C]glutamate+glutamine, [2-13C]glutamate+glutamine, [4-13C]glutamine, [2,3-13C]aspartate and [6-13C]N-acetyl aspartate with a high temporal (3.6 min) and spatial resolution (32x32 grid with nominal voxel size of 0.33 L) in five volunteers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the Influence of Anatomical Accuracy and Electrode Positions on EEG Forward Solutions</a></h4>

              
                Generating realistic volume conductor models for forward calculations in electroencephalography is not trivial and several factors contribute to the accuracy of such models, two of which are its anatomical accuracy and the accuracy with which electrode positions are known. Here, we investigate effects of anatomical accuracy by comparing forward solutions from SimNIBS, a tool which allows state-of-the-art anatomical modeling, with well-established pipelines in MNE-Python and FieldTrip. We also compare different ways of specifying electrode locations when digitized positions are not available such as transformation of measured positions from standard space and transformation of a manufacturer layout. Substantial effects of anatomical accuracy were seen throughout the entire brain both in terms of field topography and magnitude with SimNIBS generally being more accurate than the pipelines in MNE-Python and FieldTrip. Topographic and magnitude effects were particularly pronounced for MNE-Python which uses a three-layer boundary element model. We attribute these mainly to differences in skull and cerebrospinal fluid modeling. Effects of electrode specification method were evident in occipital and posterior areas when using a transformed manufacturer layout whereas transforming measured positions from standard space generally resulted in smaller errors. We suggest modeling the anatomy of the volume conductor as accurately possible and we hope to facilitate this by making it easy to export simulations from SimNIBS to MNE-Python and FieldTrip for further analysis. Likewise, if digitized electrode positions are not available, a set of measured positions on a standard head template may be preferable to those specified by the manufacturer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scream's roughness confers a privileged access to the brain during sleep</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, recognizing threatening signals is crucial to know when to wake up and when to continue vital sleep functions. Screaming is perhaps the most salient and efficient signal for communicating danger at a distance or in conditions of limited visibility. Beyond the intensity or the pitch of the sound, rapid modulations of sound pressure in the so-called roughness range (i.e. 30-150 Hz) are particularly powerful in capturing attention and accelerating reactions. Roughness is an acoustic feature that characterizes alarm signals such as screams. However, whether rough sounds are also processed in a privileged manner during sleep is unknown. We tested this hypothesis by stimulating sleeping human participants with low-intensity screams and neutral calls. We found that screams trigger more reliable and better time-locked responses in wakefulness and NREM sleep. In addition, screams boosted sleep spindles, suggesting elevated stimulus salience. The increase in sleep spindle power was linearly proportional to the roughness of vocalizations, but not to their pitch. These findings demonstrate that, even at low sound intensity, scream's roughness conveys stimulus relevance and enhances processing in both the waking and sleeping states. Preserved differential neural responses based on stimulus salience may ensure adaptive reactions -and ultimately survival- in a state where the brain is mostly disconnected from external inputs.

	<p>Aging-related neurocognitive disorder (NCD) is a growing health concern. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite from dietary precursors, might emerge as a promising biomarker of cognitive dysfunction within the context of brain aging and NCD. TMAO may increase among older adults, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients, and individuals with cognitive sequelae of stroke. Higher circulating TMAO would make them more vulnerable to age- and NCD-related cognitive decline, via mechanisms such as promoting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reducing synaptic plasticity and function. However, these observations are contrary to the cognitive benefit reported for TMAO through its positive effects on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier integrity, as well as from the supplementation of TMAO precursors. Hence, current disputable evidence does not allow definite conclusions as to whether TMAO could serve as a critical target for cognitive health. This article provides a comprehensive overview of TMAO documented thus far on cognitive change due to aging and NCD.</p>

	<p>(1) Introduction: Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorder (CTD) are common neurodevelopmental/-psychiatric disorders. The aetiological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of TS/CTD are still poorly understood. The possible risk factors for TS/CTD are considered to be a combination of genetic, immunological, psychological and environmental factors. A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to assess the association between aetiological factors and TS/CTD. (2) Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang data, and CNKI, were searched to identify the etiological factors of children and adolescents (&amp;amp;le;18 years) with TS/CTD based on a case-control study. Quality assessments were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). (3) Results: According to sample sizes and NOS values, recent evidence may support that genetic factors (BTBD9 and AADAC), immunological factors (streptococcus and mycoplasma pneumoniae infections), environmental factors (conflict, history of perinatal diseases, and family history of neurological and psychiatric diseases and recurrent respiratory infections) and psychological factors (major life events) are associated with the pathogenesis of TS/CTD. (4) Conclusions: Some risk factors in different categories may be the etiological factors of TS/CTD, but there is a lack of studies on the interaction among the factors, which may require more attention in the future.</p>

	<p>Balanced time perspective refers to the ability to flexibly switch between different temporal foci in an adaptive manner according to the current context. Functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) has been suggested to support balanced time perspective. The coupling between the DMN and fronto-parietal network (FPN) may drive many important expressions of internally directed cognition. However, it remains unclear whether balanced time perspective is supported by the interaction between the FPN and DMN. To examine these issues, we recruited 91 participants (52 males with mean age of 19.6, and 39 females with mean age of 20.0) to undergo resting-state brain imaging scan and to complete a questionnaire measuring balanced time perspective. Seed-based voxel-wise functional connectivity analyses implicated midline DMN regions including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) along with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, and cerebellum in supporting a balanced time perspective. More importantly, functional connectivity between the right amPFC and right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the FPN was found to associate with balanced time perspective. Our findings suggest the importance of coordinated brain activity in supporting a balanced time perspective.</p>
