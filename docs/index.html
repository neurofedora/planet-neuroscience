                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Cerebral venous thrombosis revealing celiac disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy resulting from intolerance of an individual genetically predisposed to gluten. It has a large clinical polymorphism ranging from a classic digestive clinical presentation due to the malabsorption syndrome to extra-intestinal symptoms. Among the hematologic abnormalities, venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) has been reported, and they are most often located in the abdomen or lower limbs, but the cerebral localization was exceptionally described. We report a case of CD revealed by cerebral thrombophlebitis. A 44-year-old patient with no medical history and no drug intake, presented with hemiplegia followed by a status epilepticus in a context of apyrexia, initially hospitalized in intensive care. Magnetic imaging resonance displayed a cerebral venous thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus requiring anticoagulant treatment, then transferred to our department for the etiological investigation. On questioning, the patient reported chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no other associated symptoms. The examination revealed an underweight patient with pale conjunctiva, improvement of her deficit symptoms, and no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests noted biological signs of malabsorption. The thrombophilia assessment revealed a protein C deficiency with a slight increase in anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Immunological tests noted positives anti-transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies. Duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy. After ruling out the other causes of VTE, the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to CD was retained. Early diagnosis and treatment of CD improves the quality-of-life for patients and may spare them various long-term or even fatal complications.

                Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and delirium are common in advanced phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: Thirty-eight moderate-severe AD patients were enrolled (n=16 affected by type 2 diabetes). Each patient received a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) (including evaluation of BPSD and frailty), and a complete metabolic evaluation (including the measurement of the glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c). Results: Both the hyper- and hypo-glycemic extremes of the glycemic spectrum worsened BPSD, but delirium was more susceptible to hypoglycemic events. The severity of delirium was significantly related to cognitive function (r = -0.585, p<0.001) and frailty (r = +0.440, p<0.05). Conclusions: The measurement of HbA1c was useful for evaluating the risk of delirium in relationship to glycemic control and nutritional status.

                This dataset is an accumulation of data collected to test Rwandan physics students’ conceptual understanding of light phenomena and to assess instructional tools for active learning of optics. We collected and analysed data from 251 grade 11 (senior 5) students using our Light Phenomena Conceptual Assessment (LPCA) tool and from 136 grade 10 (senior 4) students using Geometric Optics Conceptual Understanding Test (GOCUT) in 2019. Before collecting data, we designed and validated LPCA and GOCUT, and tested their reliability. Data were collected before and after students learnt about the unit of light. Both day and boarding schools in rural and urban areas were included in our sampling. Data collected were test scores from students after performing a 30-item LPCA test or 25-item GOCUT test in 40 minutes. The data may be reused to extend  students' understanding of optics concepts through item analysis, analysis of school characteristics such as location and school type, or by analysing students' characteristics such as subject combinations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlation between CD44+ cancer stem cell expression and histopathological types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) recurrency rate is still high despite patients receiving complete treatment. The response to treatment may vary depending on the type of histopathology and Epstein-Barr virus, however the mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have found that there is a relationship between response to treatment and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD44+ cancer stem cells may cause cancer cells to be resistant to treatment. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aims to determine the correlation between CD44 + cancer stem cell expression and the histopathological types of NPC. Method: Samples were obtained from NPC biopsies of type I, II, III patients (based on WHO histopathology criteria), who had not received prior treatment. CD44+ expression was examined using immunohistochemistry methods by staining CD44+ monoclonal antibodies. The degree of CD44+ cell membrane expression was based on the immunoreactive score scale or the Remmele index scale. Results: Most histopathological types were WHO type III (21 patients, 50%), followed by type II (18 patients, 42.86%), and type I (3 patients, 7.14%). CD44 + expression on type I showed one patient had moderate positive and two patients had a high-positive expression. In type II, 10 were moderate positive and eight were high-positive. In type III, one patient was low-positive, 11 were moderate positive and nine patients were high-positive. Statistical analysis showed that the CD44+ expression difference between the three histopathology types were not statistically significant. Conclusion: There were no correlations between CD44 + expression and histopathological type of NPC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptualizing an inquiry-based lingua-cultural learning through telecollaborative exchanges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, telecollaboration has been gaining popularity among scholars, teachers, and students engaged in foreign language education because it facilitates the use of Internet-mediated communication tools to connect language and culture learners in geographically distant locations. Telecollaboration, as currently viewed in academic and classroom settings, places greater emphasis on the development of learners’ intercultural communicative competence. The problem with this approach is that this process may not consider the possibility that learners engaged in online intercultural exchanges could have limited or no knowledge about certain aspects of their own lingua-culture. We argue that, for learners to effectively share lingua-cultural knowledge with their online peers abroad, there must be a framework that supports the construction of learners’ own intra-cultural knowledge to provide a solid foundation for intercultural learning and communication. In this paper, we develop an inquiry-based model of telecollaboration incorporating both inquiry and online exchange based on the inquiry cycle, which includes engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. This paper builds a case for the application of inquiry-based telecollaboration in a real classroom environment, which could not only help learners obtain and eventually share more authentic, deeper knowledge about their lingua-culture, but also promote informed intercultural exchange.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Functional and non-functional types of adrenal tumors: a case series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Adrenal gland masses could be classified into functional, malignant, or benign. An adrenal cortical adenoma is one of the most common incidentalomas found with either functional or non-functional type. Pheochromocytoma is a neural crest cell origin tumor associated with catecholamine production. A classic triad of headache, sudden episodic perspiration, and tachycardia marked a pheochromocytoma. We report three patients with adrenal tumors. First, a 52-year-old woman with complaints of pain in the left flank suggests a left kidney tumor. The patient has an increased blood pressure intraoperatively. Adrenal cortical adenoma was found postoperatively. The second case is an Indonesian male 27-year-old with pain in the upper right abdomen. Intraoperative, the patient also has an escalation in blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs are also used in this patient. Postoperatively, a pathology result of pheochromocytoma was revealed from this patient. The third case, adrenal myelolipoma, was suspected in a 48-year-old male and underwent surgery because of tumor growth. Later, a histopathological examination revealed myelolipoma of the adrenal. Management of adrenal tumor should be done individually based on each patient. In the first and second cases, blood pressure was unstable intraoperatively and was managed using several drugs, and was stable at follow-up. In the third case was no hemodynamic problem. In the case of an adrenal tumor, management tailoring should be based on the individual patient.

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a great burden on governments and the medical fraternity globally. Many clinical studies from the Indian system of Traditional Medicines [Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)] have been carried out to find appropriate solutions. Through a living systematic review and meta-analysis, this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Traditional System of Indian Medicine (AYUSH system) in lowering the incidence, duration, and severity of COVID-19. Methods: We will search the following databases: Pubmed; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL); the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI); Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA): AYUSH research portal; and World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. Clinical improvement, WHO ordinal scale, viral clearance, incidences of COVID-19 infection, and mortality will be considered as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes will be use of O2 therapy or mechanical ventilator, admission to high dependency unit or emergency unit, duration of hospitalization, the time to symptom resolution, and adverse events. Two authors will independently search the articles, extract the data and disagreements will be resolved by the involvement of a third reviewer. Data will be synthesized, and the risk of bias will be assessed with RevMan 5.4 tool. Certainty of evidence will be assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) tool. The review will be updated bi-monthly with two updates. Conclusion: This living systematic review will be the first to address AYUSH interventions in COVID-19, synthesizing the full spectrum of Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19. It will facilitate professionals, guideline developers, and authorities with up to date synthesis on interventions periodically to make health-care decisions on AYUSH therapies in the management of COVID-19.

                Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is globally one of the most common forms of cancer. Palliative treatment is a delicate balance against toxicity and survival. Using small frequent doses of chemotherapy, metronomic regimens have been hypothesized to maintain or even improve efficacy while achieving a lower treatment-related toxicity. The mechanism is thought to result from a more continuous exposure of the tumour cells to the drugs. Treating NSCLC, this study addresses the feasibility and tolerability of carboplatin in combination with 12 weeks of daily metronomic vinorelbine. Method: Patients were included over a period of ten months. All patients had biopsy-verified incurable NSCLC and were candidates for first line chemotherapy (PD-L1<50% and no targetable mutations). This open label, non-randomized prospective safety and feasibility study was investigator initiated. Patients received up-to four cycles of standard dose carboplatin AUC 5 every third week in combination with 12 weeks of metronomic oral daily Navelbine® (20/30 mg). Patients were evaluated by CT scans after end of treatment and then every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) until progression. Results: A total of 20 patients were included. Male/female-ratio was 4/16. Age ranged from 49-83 with a median of 70.5 years. Majority had adenocarcinoma (95%). Two patients withdrew their consent within a week. 18 patients were included in safety analysis. 13 received all four cycles. Grade 1/2 toxicity was frequently seen and included fatigue 13 (72%), diarrhoea 13 (72%), constipation/congestion 13 (72%). Grade 3 toxicities were dyspnoea 2 (11%), nausea 3 (17%) and fatigue 3 (17%). Two (11%) had grade 4 toxicity with neutropenic fever, both recovered. No grade 5 toxicity was detected. Conclusion: In treatment of NSCLC this study is the first addressing the regimen of carboplatin in combination with daily metronomic vinorelbine. We conclude that doublet chemotherapy with daily vinorelbine is safe and feasible.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea: using modified photovoice to document perspectives of traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Globally, health understanding and beliefs vary across sub-cultural groups, depending on geographical location. Increasingly, various parts of the world recognize these perspectives to offer culturally sensitive healthcare services at primary level. Understanding the indigenous perspectives of dysmenorrhea meaning from the custodians of knowledge holders may add to the value of literature that may be used to advocate humanized culturally sensitive healthcare. This article aimed to explore and describe the perspectives regarding the meaning of indigenous dysmenorrhea among Batlokwa traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs). Methods: A qualitative, explorative study with a modified photovoice design, which included photographs, interviews and lekgotla discussion was employed to engage THPs and IKHs residing in Botlokwa Limpopo province, South Africa. Initially, a purposive sampling technique was used to select the participants, followed by snowball sampling. The participants themselves analyzed the photographs and described their meaning during individual interview using the acronym “PHOTO”. The researchers employed thematic analysis of interviews and Lekgotla discussion, in which themes were identified, formulated and analyzed from the codified data set. Results: In total, eight women participated in the photovoice study. The findings showed that indigenous understanding of dysmenorrhea stems from the African belief about health and illness with special emphasis on importance of holistic meaning. To the THPs and IKHs dysmenorrhea was a broad and integrated trend of a normal or abnormal process of illness that occurs periodically during menstruation. Conclusions: The THP’s and IKH’s indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea reflects physical, mental, emotional, social, environmental, political and economic dimensions. Therefore, dysmenorrhea should be understood from a holistic approach. With appropriate partnerships and processes in place, this knowledge may be well represented in dominant healthcare systems and health research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Independent predictors of comprehensive knowledge of HIV in general population: findings from the Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015-16) [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Myanmar has the third highest number of people living with HIV in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia and Thailand. The independent predictors of comprehensive HIV knowledge among general population are not known. Methods: In this nationally representative study, we adopted a cross-sectional design using secondary data from the Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015-16). We included all women and men aged 15-49 years who participated in the survey. We have provided weighted estimates as the analyses were weighted for the multi-stage sampling design. We used modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimates model to identify independent predictors of comprehensive knowledge. Results: Of 17,622 analyzed, 3,599 (20.4%, 95% CI: 19.7, 21.1) had comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Late adolescents, those with less than a high school education, those involved in agriculture and the poorest two quintiles were less likely to have comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Conclusion: In Myanmar, comprehensive knowledge of HIV among the general population needs to be improved and we identified certain independent predictors that could be specifically targeted by the national programme.

                Nucleic acid nanodevices present great potential as agents for logic-based therapeutic intervention as well as in basic biology. Often, however, the disease targets that need corrective action are localized in specific organs and thus realizing the full potential of DNA nanodevices also requires ways to target them to specific cell-types <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that by exploiting either endogenous or synthetic receptor-ligand interactions and by leveraging the biological barriers presented by the organism, we can target extraneously introduced DNA nanodevices to specific cell types in <i>C. elegans</i>, with sub-cellular precision. The amenability of DNA nanostructures to tissue-specific targeting <i>in vivo</i> significantly expands their utility in biomedical applications and discovery biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptomic encoding of sensorimotor transformation in the midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor transformation, a process that converts sensory stimuli into motor actions, is critical for the brain to initiate behaviors. Although the circuitry involved in sensorimotor transformation has been well delineated, the molecular logic behind this process remains poorly understood. Here, we performed high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure implicated in early sensorimotor transformation. We found that SC neurons in distinct laminae express discrete marker genes. Of particular interest, <i>Cbln2</i> and <i>Pitx2</i> are key markers that define glutamatergic projection neurons in the optic nerve (Op) and intermediate gray (InG) layers, respectively. The Cbln2+ neurons responded to visual stimuli mimicking cruising predators, while the Pitx2+ neurons encoded prey-derived vibrissal tactile cues. By forming distinct input and output connections with other brain areas, these neuronal subtypes independently mediate behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our results reveal that, in the midbrain, sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Processing of the ribosomal ubiquitin-like fusion protein FUBI-eS30/FAU is required for 40S maturation and depends on USP36</a></h4>

              
                In humans and other holozoan organisms, the ribosomal protein eS30 is synthesized as a fusion protein with the ubiquitin-like protein FUBI. However, FUBI is not part of the mature 40S ribosomal subunit and cleaved off by an as-of-yet unidentified protease. How FUBI-eS30 processing is coordinated with 40S subunit maturation is unknown. To study the mechanism and importance of FUBI-eS30 processing, we expressed non-cleavable mutants in human cells, which affected late steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation, including the maturation of 18S rRNA and recycling of late-acting ribosome biogenesis factors. Differential affinity purification of wild-type and non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants identified the deubiquitinase USP36 as a candidate FUBI-eS30 processing enzyme. Depletion of USP36 by RNAi or CRISPRi indeed impaired FUBI-eS30 processing and moreover, purified USP36 cut FUBI-eS30 <i>in vitro</i>. Together, these data demonstrate the functional importance of FUBI-eS30 cleavage and identify USP36 as a novel protease involved in this process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High potency of sequential therapy with only beta-lactam antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptation is a major source of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. Evolution-informed therapy aims to constrain resistance by accounting for bacterial evolvability. Sequential treatments with antibiotics that target different bacterial processes were previously shown to limit adaptation through genetic resistance trade-offs and negative hysteresis. Treatment with homogeneous sets of antibiotics is generally viewed to be disadvantageous, as it should rapidly lead to cross-resistance. We here challenged this assumption by determining the evolutionary response of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> to experimental sequential treatments involving both heterogenous and homogeneous antibiotic sets. To our surprise, we found that fast switching between only β-lactam antibiotics resulted in increased extinction of bacterial populations. We demonstrate that extinction is favored by low rates of spontaneous resistance emergence and low levels of spontaneous cross-resistance among the antibiotics in sequence. The uncovered principles may help to guide the optimized use of available antibiotics in highly potent, evolution-informed treatment designs.

                Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spine disorder affecting children worldwide, yet little is known about the pathogenesis of this disorder. Here, we demonstrate that genetic regulation of structural components of the axial skeleton, the intervertebral discs, and dense connective tissues (i.e., ligaments and tendons) are essential for the maintenance of spinal alignment. We show that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG6, previously implicated in human AIS association studies, is required in these tissues to maintain typical spine alignment in mice. Furthermore, we show that ADGRG6 regulates biomechanical properties of tendon and stimulates CREB signaling governing gene expression in cartilaginous tissues of the spine. Treatment with a cAMP agonist could mirror aspects of receptor function in culture, thus defining core pathways for regulating these axial cartilaginous and connective tissues. As <i>ADGRG6 </i>is a key gene involved in human AIS, these findings open up novel therapeutic opportunities for human scoliosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell analysis of mosquito hemocytes identifies signatures of immune cell sub-types and cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito immune cells, known as hemocytes, are integral to cellular and humoral responses that limit pathogen survival and mediate immune priming. However, without reliable cell markers and genetic tools, studies of mosquito immune cells have been limited to morphological observations, leaving several aspects of their biology uncharacterized. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize mosquito immune cells, demonstrating an increased complexity to previously defined prohemocyte, oenocytoid, and granulocyte subtypes. Through functional assays relying on phagocytosis, phagocyte depletion, and RNA-FISH experiments, we define markers to accurately distinguish immune cell subtypes and provide evidence for immune cell maturation and differentiation. In addition, gene-silencing experiments demonstrate the importance of lozenge in defining the mosquito oenocytoid cell fate. Together, our scRNA-seq analysis provides an important foundation for future studies of mosquito immune cell biology and a valuable resource for comparative invertebrate immunology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Association of human breast cancer CD44-/CD24- cells with delayed distant metastasis</a></h4>

              
                Tumor metastasis remains the main cause of breast cancer-related deaths, especially delayed breast cancer distant metastasis. The current study assessed the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cells in 576 tissue specimens for associations with clinicopathological features and metastasis and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that higher frequency (≥19.5%) of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cells was associated with delayed postoperative breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells spontaneously converted into CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cancer stem cells (CSCs) with properties similar to CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> CSCs from primary human breast cancer cells and parental TNBC cells in terms of stemness marker expression, self-renewal, differentiation, tumorigenicity and lung metastasis<i> in vitro</i> and <i>in NOD/SCID mice</i>. RNA sequencing identified several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in newly converted CSCs and <i>RHBDL2</i>, one of the DEGs, expression was up-regulated. More importantly, <i>RHBDL2</i> silencing inhibited the YAP1/USP31/NF-κB signaling and attenuated spontaneous CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell conversion into CSCs and their mammosphere formation. These findings suggest that the frequency of CD44<sup>-</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> tumor cells and <i>RHBDL2</i> may be valuable for prognosis of delayed breast cancer metastasis, particularly for TNBC.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Pathogenic variants in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> gene are associated with a phenotypic spectrum spanning from late-onset, slowly progressive, relatively pure ataxia to early-onset, fast progressive multisystemic disease. Since its first description in 2007 as an adult-onset ataxia in French Canadian families, subsequent identification of patients worldwide has widened the clinical spectrum and increased the number of identified pathogenic variants. We report a 20-year-old Faroese female with early-onset progressive gait problems, weakness, dysphagia, slurred speech, orthostatic dizziness, and urge incontinence. Neurological examination revealed mild cognitive deficits, dysarthria, broken slow pursuit, hypometric saccades, weakness with spasticity, hyperreflexia, absent ankle reflexes, ataxia, and wide-based, spastic gait. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Severely prolonged central motor conduction time and lower motor neuron involvement was demonstrated electrophysiologically. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed hypometabolism of the cerebellum and right frontal lobe. Muscle biopsy revealed chronic neurogenic changes and near-absent immunostaining for Nesprin-1. Next-generation sequencing revealed a previously undescribed homozygous truncating, likely pathogenic variant in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> gene. The patient’s mother and paternal grandfather were heterozygous carriers of the variant. Her father’s genotype was unobtainable. We expand the list of likely pathogenic variants in <em class="a-plus-plus">SYNE1</em> ataxia with a novel homozygous truncating variant with proximity to the C-terminus and relate it to a phenotype comprising early-onset cerebellar deficits, upper and lower motor neuron involvement and cognitive deficits. Also, we report novel findings of focally reduced frontal lobe FDG-PET uptake and motor evoked potential abnormalities suggestive of central demyelination.</p>

                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 11, Pages 996: The Kinematics of Social Action: Visual Signals Provide Cues for What Interlocutors Do in Conversation</b></p>
	<p>Brain Sciences <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/8/996">doi: 10.3390/brainsci11080996</a></p>

	<p>During natural conversation, people must quickly understand the meaning of what the other speaker is saying. This concerns not just the semantic content of an utterance, but also the social action (i.e., what the utterance is doing—requesting information, offering, evaluating, checking mutual understanding, etc.) that the utterance is performing. The multimodal nature of human language raises the question of whether visual signals may contribute to the rapid processing of such social actions. However, while previous research has shown that how we move reveals the intentions underlying instrumental actions, we do not know whether the intentions underlying fine-grained social actions in conversation are also revealed in our bodily movements. Using a corpus of dyadic conversations combined with manual annotation and motion tracking, we analyzed the kinematics of the torso, head, and hands during the asking of questions. Manual annotation categorized these questions into six more fine-grained social action types (i.e., request for information, other-initiated repair, understanding check, stance or sentiment, self-directed, active participation). We demonstrate, for the first time, that the kinematics of the torso, head and hands differ between some of these different social action categories based on a 900 ms time window that captures movements starting slightly prior to or within 600 ms after utterance onset. These results provide novel insights into the extent to which our intentions shape the way that we move, and provide new avenues for understanding how this phenomenon may facilitate the fast communication of meaning in conversational interaction, social action, and conversation.</p>

	<p>Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as the sudden death of a patient with epilepsy in the absence of an anatomic or toxicologic cause. Whether pregnancy is a risk factor for SUDEP is unclear. Using data submitted to the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG), which has been collating information regarding all maternal deaths in Japan since 2000, this study evaluated maternal mortality data from 2010 to 2019 to evaluate the current circumstances of maternal death related to SUDEP in Japan. Six women died due to SUDEP during this period; the maternal mortality rate related to SUDEP was 0.066/100,000 individuals. Two women each died during the second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum period. Four and two women were receiving monotherapy and no therapy with anti-epileptic drugs, respectively. The duration of epilepsy was ≤15 years in three women, &amp;amp;gt;15 years in one woman, and unknown in two women. This study furthers our understanding of the prevalence of maternal deaths due to SUDEP in Japan. Further studies are needed to confirm whether pregnancy is a risk factor for SUDEP.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest form of brain tumors. To date, the GBM therapeutical approach consists of surgery, radiation-therapy and chemotherapy combined with molecules improving cancer responsiveness to treatments. In this review, we will present a brief overview of the GBM classification and pathogenesis, as well as the therapeutic approach currently used. Then, we will focus on the modulatory role exerted by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, known as PACAP, on GBM malignancy. Specifically, we will describe PACAP ability to interfere with GBM cell proliferation, as well as the tumoral microenvironment. Considering its anti-oncogenic role in GBM, synthesis of PACAP agonist molecules may open new perspectives for combined therapy to existing gold standard treatment.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a key role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a highly regular, hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. However, firing rates vary from field to field and change under contextual modifications, whereas the field locations shift at most by a small amount under such “rate remapping.” The observed differences in firing rate could reflect overall activity changes or changes in the detailed spike-train statistics. As these two alternatives imply distinct neural coding schemes, we investigated whether temporal firing patterns vary from field to field and whether they change under rate remapping. Focusing on short time scales, we found that the proportion of bursts compared to all discharge events is similar in all firing fields of a given grid cell and does not change under rate remapping. For each cell, mean firing rates with bursts are proportional to mean firing rates without bursts. However, this ratio varies across cells. Additionally, we looked at how rate remapping relates to entorhinal theta-frequency oscillations. Theta-phase coding was preserved despite firing-rate changes from rate remapping but we did not observe differences between the first and second half of the theta cycle, as had been reported for CA1. Our results indicate that both, the heterogeneity between firing fields and rate remapping, are not due to altered firing patterns on short time scales but reflect location-specific changes at the firing-rate level.</p>

                Background: Although COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to have high efficacy in the general population, it has not been established whether this applies to vulnerable groups. The objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 among those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable in Scotland. Methods: In a matched case-control design (REACT-SCOT), all 111295 cases of COVID-19 in Scotland diagnosed from 1 December 2020 to 16 March 2021 were matched for age, sex and primary care practice to 1093449 controls from the general population. This was linked to national data on vaccinations and those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable and thus eligible for shielding support. Severe COVID-19 was defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Rate ratios associated with vaccination within risk groups were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: The rate ratio for severe COVID-19 associated with vaccination at least 14 days before was 0.29 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.37) in those eligible for shielding, compared with 0.29 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.34) in those ineligible for shielding. The rate ratio for hospitalized or fatal COVID-19 was 0.39 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.46) in those eligible and 0.37 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.41) in those not eligible for shielding. Examined by specific shielding conditions, the rate ratio for hospitalized or fatal COVID-19 ranged from 0.33 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.51) in those with specific cancers to 0.74 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.51) in solid organ transplant recipients, and 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.84) in others on immunosuppressants (excluding solid organ transplant recipients). Conclusions: These results are reassuring with respect to efficacy in clinically vulnerable individuals including immunocompromised individuals, but studies in larger populations are needed to estimate efficacy in solid organ transplant recipients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Emergence of directional bias in tau deposition from axonal transport dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Torok, Pedro D. Maia, Parul Verma, Christopher Mezias, Ashish Raj</p>

Defects in axonal transport may partly underpin the differences between the observed pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that of other non-amyloidogenic tauopathies. Particularly, pathological tau variants may have molecular properties that dysregulate motor proteins responsible for the anterograde-directed transport of tau in a disease-specific fashion. Here we develop the first computational model of tau-modified axonal transport that produces directional biases in the spread of tau pathology. We simulated the spatiotemporal profiles of soluble and insoluble tau species in a multicompartment, two-neuron system using biologically plausible parameters and time scales. Changes in the balance of tau transport feedback parameters can elicit anterograde and retrograde biases in the distributions of soluble and insoluble tau between compartments in the system. Aggregation and fragmentation parameters can also perturb this balance, suggesting a complex interplay between these distinct molecular processes. Critically, we show that the model faithfully recreates the characteristic network spread biases in both AD-like and non-AD-like mouse tauopathy models. Tau transport feedback may therefore help link microscopic differences in tau conformational states and the resulting variety in clinical presentations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The kinetic landscape of nucleosome assembly: A coarse-grained molecular dynamics study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giovanni B. Brandani, Cheng Tan, Shoji Takada</p>

The organization of nucleosomes along the Eukaryotic genome is maintained over time despite disruptive events such as replication. During this complex process, histones and DNA can form a variety of non-canonical nucleosome conformations, but their precise molecular details and roles during nucleosome assembly remain unclear. In this study, employing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling, we characterized the complete kinetics of nucleosome assembly. On the nucleosome-positioning 601 DNA sequence, we observe a rich transition network among various canonical and non-canonical tetrasome, hexasome, and nucleosome conformations. A low salt environment makes nucleosomes stable, but the kinetic landscape becomes more rugged, so that the system is more likely to be trapped in off-pathway partially assembled intermediates. Finally, we find that the co-operativity between DNA bending and histone association enables positioning sequence motifs to direct the assembly process, with potential implications for the dynamic organization of nucleosomes on real genomic sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational Eurotransplant kidney allocation simulations demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of T-cell epitope matching</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthias Niemann, Nils Lachmann, Kirsten Geneugelijk, Eric Spierings</p>

The EuroTransplant Kidney Allocation System (ETKAS) aims at allocating organs to patients on the waiting list fairly whilst optimizing HLA match grades. ETKAS currently considers the number of HLA-A, -B, -DR mismatches. Evidently, epitope matching is biologically and clinically more relevant. We here executed ETKAS-based computer simulations to evaluate the impact of epitope matching on allocation and compared the strategies. A virtual population of 400,000 individuals was generated using the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) haplotype frequency dataset of 2011. Using this population, a waiting list of 10,400 patients was constructed and maintained during simulation, matching the 2015 Eurotransplant Annual Report characteristics. Unacceptable antigens were assigned randomly relative to their frequency using HLAMatchmaker. Over 22,600 kidneys were allocated in 10 years in triplicate using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations on 32-CPU-core cloud-computing instances. T-cell epitopes were calculated using the www.pirche.com portal. Waiting list effects were evaluated against ETKAS for five epitope matching scenarios. Baseline simulations of ETKAS slightly overestimated reported average HLA match grades. The best balanced scenario maintained prioritisation of HLA A-B-DR fully matched donors while replacing the HLA match grade by PIRCHE-II score and exchanging the HLA mismatch probability (MMP) by epitope MMP. This setup showed no considerable impact on kidney exchange rates and waiting time. PIRCHE-II scores improved, whereas the average HLA match grade diminishes slightly, yet leading to an improved estimated graft survival. We conclude that epitope-based matching in deceased donor kidney allocation is feasible while maintaining equal balances on the waiting list.

Loss of function mutations of <i>SCN1A</i>, the gene coding for the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, cause different types of epilepsy, whereas gain of function mutations cause sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM-3). However, it is not clear yet how these opposite effects can induce paroxysmal pathological activities involving neuronal networks’ hyperexcitability that are specific of epilepsy (seizures) or migraine (cortical spreading depolarization, CSD). To better understand differential mechanisms leading to the initiation of these pathological activities, we used a two-neuron conductance-based model of interconnected GABAergic and pyramidal glutamatergic neurons, in which we incorporated ionic concentration dynamics in both neurons. We modeled FHM-3 mutations by increasing the persistent sodium current in the interneuron and epileptogenic mutations by decreasing the sodium conductance in the interneuron. Therefore, we studied both FHM-3 and epileptogenic mutations within the same framework, modifying only two parameters. In our model, the key effect of gain of function FHM-3 mutations is ion fluxes modification at each action potential (in particular the larger activation of voltage-gated potassium channels induced by the Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 gain of function), and the resulting CSD-triggering extracellular potassium accumulation, which is not caused only by modifications of firing frequency. Loss of function epileptogenic mutations, on the other hand, increase GABAergic neurons’ susceptibility to depolarization block, without major modifications of firing frequency before it. Our modeling results connect qualitatively to experimental data: potassium accumulation in the case of FHM-3 mutations and facilitated depolarization block of the GABAergic neuron in the case of epileptogenic mutations. Both these effects can lead to pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability, inducing in the migraine condition depolarization block of both the GABAergic and the pyramidal neuron. Overall, our findings suggest different mechanisms of network hyperexcitability for migraine and epileptogenic Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 mutations, implying that the modifications of firing frequency may not be the only relevant pathological mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Perturbations in dynamical models of whole-brain activity dissociate between the level and stability of consciousness</a></h4>

Consciousness transiently fades away during deep sleep, more stably under anesthesia, and sometimes permanently due to brain injury. The development of an index to quantify the level of consciousness across these different states is regarded as a key problem both in basic and clinical neuroscience. We argue that this problem is ill-defined since such an index would not exhaust all the relevant information about a given state of consciousness. While the level of consciousness can be taken to describe the actual brain state, a complete characterization should also include its potential behavior against external perturbations. We developed and analyzed whole-brain computational models to show that the stability of conscious states provides information complementary to their similarity to conscious wakefulness. Our work leads to a novel methodological framework to sort out different brain states by their stability and reversibility, and illustrates its usefulness to dissociate between physiological (sleep), pathological (brain-injured patients), and pharmacologically-induced (anesthesia) loss of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Modulation of fatty acid elongation in cockroaches sustains sexually dimorphic hydrocarbons and female attractiveness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiao-Jin Pei, Yong-Liang Fan, Yu Bai, Tian-Tian Bai, Coby Schal, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Nan Chen, Sheng Li, Tong-Xian Liu</p>

Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve as important intersexual signaling chemicals and generally show variation between the sexes, but little is known about the generation of sexually dimorphic hydrocarbons (SDHCs) in insects. In this study, we report the molecular mechanism and biological significance that underlie the generation of SDHC in the German cockroach <i>Blattella germanica</i>. Sexually mature females possess more C29 CHCs, especially the contact sex pheromone precursor 3,11-DimeC29. RNA interference (RNAi) screen against the fatty acid elongase family members combined with heterologous expression of the genes in yeast revealed that both <i>BgElo12</i> and <i>BgElo24</i> were involved in hydrocarbon (HC) production, but <i>BgElo24</i> is of wide catalytic activities and is able to provide substrates for <i>BgElo12</i>, and only the female-enriched <i>BgElo12</i> is responsible for sustaining female-specific HC profile. Repressing <i>BgElo12</i> masculinized the female CHC profile, decreased contact sex pheromone level, and consequently reduced the sexual attractiveness of female cockroaches. Moreover, the asymmetric expression of <i>BgElo12</i> between the sexes is modulated by sex differentiation cascade. Specifically, male-specific <i>BgDsx</i> represses the transcription of <i>BgElo12</i> in males, while <i>BgTra</i> is able to remove this effect in females. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism responsible for the formation of SDHCs and also provide evidences on shaping of the SDHCs by sexual selection, as females use them to generate high levels of contact sex pheromone.

<p>Cataglyphis desert ants show impressive navigation capabilities during foraging. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges. Here, we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of Cataglyphis nodus males (♂), gynes (♀), and foragers (☿) by quantifying relative neuropil volumes, synaptic architecture, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe olfactory glomeruli. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex- and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants are charismatic central place foragers. After long-ranging foraging trips, individual workers navigate back to their nest relying mostly on visual cues. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges, i.e. mate finding and colony foundation. Here we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males, gynes, and foragers by quantifying relative neuropil volumes associated with two visual pathways, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe (AL) olfactory glomeruli. Furthermore, we determined absolute numbers of synaptic complexes in visual and olfactory regions of the mushroom bodies (MB) and a major relay station of the sky-compass pathway to the central complex (CX). Both female castes possess enlarged brain centers for sensory integration, learning, and memory, reflected in voluminous MBs containing about twice the numbers of synaptic complexes compared to males. Overall, male brains are smaller compared to both female castes, but the relative volumes of the optic lobes and CX are enlarged indicating the importance of visual guidance during innate behaviors. Male ALs contain greatly enlarged glomeruli, presumably involved in sex-pheromone detection. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex- and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.</p>

     alt="Mapping reward mechanisms by intracerebral self-stimulation in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)"/>
<p>

Testing the reward versus aversive value of electrical stimulation of 74 structures of the macaque brain revealed a ubiquitous distribution of valenced sites in pathways throughout the brain. Most positive were striatal and frontal cortical structures densely innervated by pathways originating in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) cell groups A9 and A10. Nevertheless, reward related more to structures' neurobehavioral function than to density of DA-innervation. Many positive sites were found in non-DA posterior cingulate cortex, and stimulation of purely sensory and motor areas was generally negative, regardless of DA innervation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self-stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of ~2900 sites in 74 structures of 4 sensorimotor pathways and 4 modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense versus sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA-pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA-pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures' sensorimotor function than to density of DA-innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA-innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA-density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA-sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward-associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">miR-1 coordinately regulates lysosomal v-ATPase and biogenesis to impact proteotoxicity and muscle function during aging</a></h4>

              
                Muscle function relies on the precise architecture of dynamic contractile elements, which must be fine-tuned to maintain motility throughout life. Muscle is also plastic, and remodeled in response to stress, growth, neural and metabolic inputs. The conserved muscle-enriched microRNA, miR-1, regulates distinct aspects of muscle development, but whether it plays a role during aging is unknown. Here we investigated <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> miR-1 in muscle function in response to proteostatic stress. <i>mir-1</i> deletion improved mid-life muscle motility, pharyngeal pumping, and organismal longevity upon polyQ35 proteotoxic challenge. We identified multiple vacuolar ATPase subunits as subject to miR-1 control, and the regulatory subunit <i>vha-13</i>/ATP6V1A as a direct target downregulated via its 3′UTR to mediate miR-1 physiology. miR-1 further regulates nuclear localization of lysosomal biogenesis factor HLH-30/TFEB and lysosomal acidification. Our studies reveal that miR-1 coordinately regulates lysosomal v-ATPase and biogenesis to impact muscle function and health during aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Revisiting the guidelines for ending isolation for COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

              
                Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, two mainstream guidelines for defining when to end the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals have been in use: the one-size-fits-all approach (i.e. patients are isolated for a fixed number of days) and the personalized approach (i.e. based on repeated testing of isolated patients). We use a mathematical framework to model within-host viral dynamics and test different criteria for ending isolation. By considering a fixed time of 10 days since symptom onset as the criterion for ending isolation, we estimated that the risk of releasing an individual who is still infectious is low (0–6.6%). However, this policy entails lengthy unnecessary isolations (4.8–8.3 days). In contrast, by using a personalized strategy, similar low risks can be reached with shorter prolonged isolations. The obtained findings provide a scientific rationale for policies on ending the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RTN3 inhibits RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses by impairing TRIM25-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination</a></h4>

              
                Upon viral RNA recognition, the RIG-I signalosome continuously generates IFNs and cytokines, leading to neutrophil recruitment and inflammation. Thus, attenuation of excessive immune and inflammatory responses is crucial to restore immune homeostasis and prevent unwarranted damage, yet few resolving mediators have been identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that RTN3 is strongly upregulated during RNA viral infection and acts as an inflammation-resolving regulator. Increased RTN3 aggregates on the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with both TRIM25 and RIG-I, subsequently impairing K63-linked polyubiquitination and resulting in both IRF3 and NF-κB inhibition. Rtn3 overexpression in mice causes an obvious inflammation resolving phenomenon when challenged with VSV, Rtn3-overexpressing mice display significantly decreased neutrophil numbers and inflammatory cell infiltration, which is accompanied by reduced tissue edema in the liver and thinner alveolar interstitium. Taken together, our findings identify RTN3 as a conserved negative regulator of immune and inflammatory responses and provide insights into the negative feedback that maintains immune and inflammatory homeostasis.

                Since the influenza pandemic in 2009, there has been an increased focus on swine influenza A virus (swIAV) surveillance. This paper describes the results of the surveillance of swIAV in Danish swine from 2011 to 2018. In total, 3800 submissions were received with a steady increase in swIAV positive submissions, reaching 56% in 2018. Full genome sequences were obtained from 129 swIAV positive samples. Altogether, 17 different circulating genotypes were identified including six novel reassortants harboring human seasonal IAV gene segments. The phylogenetic analysis revealed substantial genetic drift and also evidence of positive selection occurring mainly in antigenic sites of the hemagglutinin protein and confirmed the presence of a swine divergent cluster among the H1pdm09Nx (clade 1A.3.3.2) viruses. The results provide essential data for the control of swIAV in pigs and emphasize the importance of contemporary surveillance for discovering novel swIAV strains posing a potential threat to the human population.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptomics-informed large-scale cortical model captures topography of pharmacological neuroimaging effects of LSD</a></h4>

              
                Psychoactive drugs can transiently perturb brain physiology while preserving brain structure. The role of physiological state in shaping neural function can therefore be investigated through neuroimaging of pharmacologically induced effects. Previously, using pharmacological neuroimaging, we found that neural and experiential effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are attributable to agonism of the serotonin-2A receptor (Preller et al., 2018). Here, we integrate brain-wide transcriptomics with biophysically based circuit modeling to simulate acute neuromodulatory effects of LSD on human cortical large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics. Our model captures the inter-areal topography of LSD-induced changes in cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional connectivity. These findings suggest that serotonin-2A-mediated modulation of pyramidal-neuronal gain is a circuit mechanism through which LSD alters cortical functional topography. Individual-subject model fitting captures patterns of individual neural differences in pharmacological response related to altered states of consciousness. This work establishes a framework for linking molecular-level manipulations to systems-level functional alterations, with implications for precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-molecule imaging of chromatin remodelers reveals role of ATPase in promoting fast kinetics of target search and dissociation from chromatin</a></h4>

              
                Conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers establish and maintain genome-wide chromatin architectures of regulatory DNA during cellular lifespan, but the temporal interactions between remodelers and chromatin targets have been obscure. We performed live-cell single-molecule tracking for RSC, SWI/SNF, CHD1, ISW1, ISW2, and INO80 remodeling complexes in budding yeast and detected hyperkinetic behaviors for chromatin-bound molecules that frequently transition to the free state for all complexes. Chromatin-bound remodelers display notably higher diffusion than nucleosomal histones, and strikingly fast dissociation kinetics with 4-7 s mean residence times. These enhanced dynamics require ATP binding or hydrolysis by the catalytic ATPase, uncovering an additional function to its established role in nucleosome remodeling. Kinetic simulations show that multiple remodelers can repeatedly occupy the same promoter region on a timescale of minutes, implicating an unending ‘tug-of-war’ that controls a temporally shifting window of accessibility for the transcription initiation machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cell stiffness is enhanced upon formation of immunological synapse</a></h4>

              
                T cells are activated by target cells via an intimate contact, termed immunological synapse (IS). Cellular mechanical properties, especially stiffness, are essential to regulate cell functions. However, T cell stiffness at a subcellular level at the IS still remains largely elusive. In this work, we established an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based elasticity mapping method on whole T cells to obtain an overview of the stiffness with a resolution of ~ 60 nm. Using primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we show that when T cells form IS with stimulating antibody-coated surfaces, the lamellipodia are stiffer than the cell body. Upon IS formation, T cell stiffness is enhanced both at the lamellipodia and on the cell body. Chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> abolishes IS-induced stiffening at the lamellipodia but has no influence on cell body-stiffening, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms of IS-induced stiffening at the lamellipodia and the cell body.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical excitability signatures for the degree of sleepiness in human</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential in maintaining physiological homeostasis in the brain. While the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, a 'synaptic homeostasis' theory has been proposed that synapses continue to strengthen during awake, and undergo downscaling during sleep. This theory predicts that brain excitability increases with sleepiness. Here, we collected transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measurements in 38 subjects in a 34-hour program, and decoded the relationship between cortical excitability and self-report sleepiness using advanced statistical methods. By utilizing a combination of partial least squares (PLS) regression and mixed-effect models, we identified a robust pattern of excitability changes, which can quantitatively predict the degree of sleepiness. Moreover, we found that synaptic strengthen occurred in both excitatory and inhibitory connections after sleep deprivation. In sum, our study provides supportive evidence for the synaptic homeostasis theory in human sleep and clarifies the process of synaptic strength modulation during sleepiness.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative mapping of dense microtubule arrays in mammalian neurons</a></h4>

              
                The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton underlies the polarization and proper functioning of neurons, amongst others by providing tracks for motor proteins that drive intracellular transport. Different subsets of neuronal microtubules, varying in composition, stability and motor preference, are known to exist, but the high density of microtubules has so far precluded mapping their relative abundance and three-dimensional organization. Here we use different super-resolution techniques (STED, Expansion Microscopy) to explore the nanoscale organization of the neuronal microtubule network in rat hippocampal neurons. This revealed that in dendrites acetylated microtubules are enriched in the core of the dendritic shaft, while tyrosinated microtubules are enriched near the plasma membrane, thus forming a shell around the acetylated microtubules. Moreover, using a novel analysis pipeline we quantified the absolute number of acetylated and tyrosinated microtubules within dendrites and found that they account for 65-75% and ~20-30% of all microtubules, respectively, leaving only few microtubules that do not fall in either category. Because these different microtubule subtypes facilitate different motor proteins, these novel insights help to understand the spatial regulation of intracellular transport.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo analysis reveals that ATP-hydrolysis couples remodeling to SWI/SNF release from chromatin</a></h4>

              
                ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers control the accessibility of genomic DNA through nucleosome mobilization. However, the dynamics of genome exploration by remodelers, and the role of ATP hydrolysis in this process remain unclear. We used live-cell imaging of <i>Drosophila</i> polytene nuclei to monitor Brahma (BRM) remodeler interactions with its chromosomal targets. In parallel, we measured local chromatin condensation and its effect on BRM association. Surprisingly, only a small portion of BRM is bound to chromatin at any given time. BRM binds decondensed chromatin but is excluded from condensed chromatin, limiting its genomic search space. BRM-chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, whereas histone-exchange is limited and much slower. Intriguingly, loss of ATP hydrolysis enhanced chromatin retention and clustering of BRM, which was associated with reduced histone turnover. Thus, ATP hydrolysis couples nucleosome remodeling to remodeler release, driving a continuous transient probing of the genome.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception of microstimulation frequency in human somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Microstimulation in the somatosensory cortex can evoke artificial tactile percepts and can be incorporated into bidirectional brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to restore function after injury or disease. However, little is known about how stimulation parameters themselves affect perception. Here, we stimulated through microelectrode arrays implanted in the somatosensory cortex of two human participants with cervical spinal cord injury and varied the stimulus amplitude, frequency and train duration. Increasing the amplitude and train duration increased the perceived intensity on all tested electrodes. Surprisingly, we found that increasing the frequency evoked more intense percepts on some electrodes but evoked less intense percepts on other electrodes. These different frequency-intensity relationships were divided into three groups which also evoked distinct percept qualities at different stimulus frequencies. Neighboring electrode sites were more likely to belong to the same group. These results support the idea that stimulation frequency directly controls tactile perception and that these different percepts may be related to the organization of somatosensory cortex, which will facilitate principled development of stimulation strategies for bidirectional BCIs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Towards novel herbicide modes of action by inhibiting lysine biosynthesis in plants</a></h4>

              
                Weeds are becoming increasingly resistant to our current herbicides, posing a significant threat to agricultural production. Therefore, new herbicides with novel modes of action are urgently needed. In this study, we exploited a novel herbicide target, dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyses the first and rate-limiting step in lysine biosynthesis. The first class of plant DHDPS inhibitors with micromolar potency against <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> DHDPS were identified using a high throughput chemical screen. We determined that this class of inhibitors binds to a novel and unexplored pocket within DHDPS, which is highly conserved across plant species. The inhibitors also attenuated the germination and growth of <i>A. thaliana</i> seedlings and confirmed their pre-emergence herbicidal activity in soil-grown plants. These results provide proof-of-concept that lysine biosynthesis represents a promising target for the development of herbicides with a novel mode of action to tackle the global rise of herbicide resistant weeds.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Dysregulated oxalate metabolism is a driver and therapeutic target in atherosclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Liu et al. show dysregulated glycine-oxalate metabolism in patients and mice with atherosclerosis. Oxalate overload due to loss of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) or hydroxy-l-proline supplementation aggravates pro-oxidant/inflammatory responses, hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis. In macrophages, oxalate induces mitochondrial dysfunction and superoxide accumulation, enhancing CCL5 release. AGXT overexpression lowers pro-oxidant/inflammatory responses, reducing atherosclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">No evidence of human genome integration of SARS-CoV-2 found by long-read DNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                In response to a recent claim that SARS-CoV-2 can be incorporated into human DNA by LINE-1 retrotransposon proteins, Smits et al. apply long-read DNA sequencing to cultured HEK293T cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. They find no evidence for genomic integration of the virus, despite demonstrated availability of the LINE-1 protein machinery.

                Sullivan et al. describe the development of a multidimensional dataset for the study of COVID-19 known as the COVIDome, which includes diverse clinical, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and immune cell datasets. A researcher portal known as the COVIDome Explorer was created to enable global data access and analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational learning of brain responses in executive function and higher-order cognition using deep graph convolutions</a></h4>

              
                Brain decoding aims to infer human cognition from recordings of neural activity using modern neuroimaging techniques. Studies so far often concentrated on a limited number of cognitive states and aimed to classifying patterns of brain activity within a local area. This procedure demonstrated a great success on classifying motor and sensory processes but showed limited power over higher cognitive functions. In this work, we investigate a high-order graph convolution model, named ChebNet, to model the segregation and integration organizational principles in neural dynamics, and to decode brain activity across a large number of cognitive domains. By leveraging our prior knowledge on brain organization using a graph-based model, ChebNet graph convolution learns a new representation from task-evoked neural activity, which demonstrates a highly predictive signature of cognitive states and task performance. Our results reveal that between-network integration significantly boosts the decoding of high-order cognition such as visual working memory tasks, while the segregation of localized brain activity is sufficient to classify motor and sensory processes. Using twin and family data from the Human Connectome Project (n = 1,070), we provide evidence that individual variability in the graph representations of working-memory tasks are under genetic control and strongly associated with participants in-scanner behaviors. These findings uncover the essential role of functional integration in brain decoding, especially when decoding high-order cognition other than sensory and motor functions.

                In order to continuously respond to a changing environment and support self-generating cognition and behaviour, neural communication must be highly flexible and dynamic at the same time than hierarchically organized. While whole-brain fMRI measures have revealed robust yet changing patterns of statistical dependencies between regions, it is not clear whether these statistical patterns (referred to as functional connectivity) can reflect dynamic large-scale communication in a way that is relevant to cognition. For functional connectivity to reflect actual communication, we propose three necessary conditions: it must span sufficient temporal complexity to support the needs of cognition while still being highly organized so that the system behaves reliably; it must be able to adapt to the current behavioural context; and it must exhibit fluctuations at sufficiently short timescales. In this paper, we introduce principal components of connectivity analysis (PCCA), an approach based on running principal component analysis on multiple runs of a time-varying functional connectivity model to show that functional connectivity follows low- yet multi-dimensional trajectories that can be reliably measured, and that these trajectories meet the aforementioned criteria to index flexible communication between neural populations and support moment-to-moment cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orthogonal but linked neural codes for value</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to effectively choose between dissimilar options implies that information regarding the options values must be available, either explicitly or implicitly, in the brain. Explicit realizations of value involve single neurons whose responses depend on value and not on the specific features that determine it. Implicit realizations, by contrast, come from the coordinated action of neurons that encode specific features. One signature of implicit value coding is that population responses to offers with the same value but different features should occupy semi- or fully orthogonal neural subspaces that are nonetheless linked. Here, we examined responses of neurons in six core value-coding areas in a choice task with risky and safe options. Using stricter criteria than some past studies have used, we find, surprisingly, no evidence for abstract value neurons (i.e., neurons with the response to equally valued risky and safe options) in any of these regions. Moreover, population codes for value resided in orthogonal subspaces; these subspaces were linked through a linear transform of each of their constituent subspaces. These results suggest that in all six regions, populations of neurons embed value implicitly in a distributed population.

                Healthy aging is associated with episodic memory decline. However, little is known about sex differences in the effect of normative aging on memory-related brain network dynamics. Here, we used a data-driven multivariate partial least squares (PLS) connectivity analysis to identify similarities and differences in the effect of biological sex on age- and memory-related differences in task-based fMRI connectivity during encoding and retrieval of face-location associations (spatial context memory). Aging was associated with episodic memory decline in both sexes, but there were no significant sex or sex-by-age interactions in memory performance. The connectivity results show that men exhibited greater between-network connectivity with advanced age, which was detrimental to memory performance. Women exhibited reduced connectivity between visual and higher order cognitive networks with advanced age, which was detrimental to memory performance. Therefore, there are sex differences in the effect of age on episodic memory-related connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Isolating the Sources of Pipeline-Variability in Group-Level Task-fMRI results</a></h4>

              
                While the development of analytical tools and techniques has broadened our horizons for comprehending the complexities of the human brain, a growing body of research in the neuroimaging literature has highlighted the pitfalls of such methodological plurality. In a recent study, we found that the choice of software package used to run the analysis pipeline can have a considerable impact on the final group-level results of a task-fMRI investigation (Bowring et al., 2019, BMN). Here we revisit our work, seeking to identify the stages of the pipeline where the greatest variation between analysis software is induced. We carry out further analyses on the three datasets evaluated in BMN, employing a common processing strategy across parts of the analysis workflow and then utilizing procedures from three different software packages (AFNI, FSL and SPM) across the remaining steps of the pipeline. We use quantitative comparisons to gauge the scale of variability between the final statistical maps and isolate the main stages of the workflow where the three packages diverge. Across all datasets, we find that variation between the packages' results is largely attributable to a handful of individual analysis stages, and that these sources of variability were heterogeneous across the datasets (e.g. choice of first-level signal model had the most impact for the ds000001 dataset, while first-level noise model was more influential for ds000109 dataset). We also observe areas of the analysis workflow where changing the software package causes minimal differences in the final results. In particular, we find that the group-level results are largely unaffected by which software package is used to model the low-frequency fMRI drifts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological measures of visual suppression</a></h4>

              
                In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">One year later: longitudinal effects of flexible school start times on teenage sleep and subjective psychological outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Early school times fundamentally clash with the late sleep of teenagers. This mismatch results in chronic sleep deprivation, which poses acute and long-term health risks and impairs students' learning. Despite conclusive evidence that delaying school times has immediate benefits for sleep, the long-term effects on sleep are unresolved due to a shortage of longitudinal data. Here, we studied whether a flexible school start system, with the daily choice of an 8AM or 08:50AM-start, allowed secondary school students to improve their sleep and psychological functioning in a longitudinal pre-post design over exactly 1 year. Based on 2 waves, each with 6-9 weeks of daily sleep diary, we found that students maintained their 1-hour-sleep gain on days with later starts, both longitudinally (n=28) and cross-sectionally (n=79). This sleep gain was independent of chronotype and frequency of later starts but differed between genders. Girls were more successful in keeping early sleep onsets despite later sleep offsets, whereas boys delayed their onsets and thus had reduced sleep gains after 1 year. Students also reported psychological benefits (n=93), increased sleep quality and reduced alarm- driven waking on later school days. Despite these benefits on later schooldays, overall sleep duration was not extended in the flexible system. This was likely due to the persistently low uptake of the late- start option. If uptake can be further promoted, the flexible system is an appealing alternative to a fixed delay of school starts owing to possible circadian advantages (speculatively through prevention of phase-delays) and psychological mechanisms (e.g. sense of control).

                Mosquitoes track odors, locate hosts, and find mates visually. The color of a food resource, such as a flower or warm-blooded host, can be dominated by long wavelengths of the visible light spectrum (green to red for humans) and is likely important for object recognition and localization. However, little is known about the hues that attract mosquitoes or how odor affects mosquito visual search behaviors. We used a real-time 3D tracking system and wind tunnel that allowed careful control of the olfactory and visual environment to quantify the behavior of more than 1.3 million mosquito trajectories. We found that CO2 induces a strong attraction to specific hues, including those that humans perceive as cyan, orange, and red. Sensitivity to orange and red correlates with mosquitoes' strong attraction to the color spectrum of human skin, which is dominated by these wavelengths. Attraction was eliminated by filtering the orange and red bands from the skin color spectrum and by introducing mutations targeting specific long-wavelength opsins or CO2 detection. Collectively, our results show that odor is critical for mosquitoes' wavelength preferences and that the mosquito visual system is a promising target for inhibiting their attraction to human hosts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thalamic deep brain stimulation as a paradigm to reduce consciousness: implications for cortico-striatal dynamics, absence epilepsy and consciousness studies</a></h4>

              
                Anesthetic manipulations provide much-needed causal evidence for neural correlates of consciousness, but nonspecific drug effects complicate their interpretation. Evidence suggests that thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) can either increase or decrease consciousness, depending on the stimulation target and parameters. The putative role of the central lateral thalamus (CL) in consciousness makes it an ideal DBS target to manipulate circuit-level mechanisms in corticostriatothalamic (CST) systems, thereby influencing consciousness and related processes. We used multimicroelectrode DBS targeted to CL in macaques while recording from frontal, parietal, and striatal regions. DBS induced episodes reminiscent of absence epilepsy, here termed absence-like activity (ALA), with decreased behavior and vacant staring coinciding with low-frequency oscillations. DBS modulated ALA likelihood in a frequency-specific manner. ALA events corresponded to decreases in measures of neural complexity (entropy) and integration (Phi*), an index of consciousness, and substantial changes to communication in CST circuits. During ALA, power spectral density and coherence at low frequencies increased across CST circuits, especially in thalamoparietal and corticostriatal pathways. Decreased consciousness and neural integration corresponded to shifts in corticostriatal network configurations that dissociated parietal and subcortical structures. Overall, the features of ALA and implicated networks were similar to those of absence epilepsy. As this same multimicroelectrode DBS method, but at different stimulation frequencies, can also increase consciousness in anesthetized macaques, it can be used to flexibly address questions of consciousness with limited confounds, as well as inform clinical investigations of absence epilepsy and other consciousness disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive process modeling addresses context independence violations in the ABCD Study stop-signal task</a></h4>

              
                The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is a longitudinal neuroimaging study of unprecedented scale that is in the process of following over 11,000 youth from middle childhood though age 20. However, a design feature of the study's stop-signal task violates "context independence", an assumption critical to current non-parametric methods for estimating stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a key measure of inhibitory ability in the study. This has led some experts to call for the task to be changed and for previously collected data to be used with caution. We present a formal cognitive process model, the BEESTS-ABCD model, that provides a mechanistic explanation for the impact of this design feature, describes key behavioral trends in the ABCD data, and allows biases in SSRT estimates resulting from context independence violations to be quantified. We use the model to demonstrate that, although non-parametric SSRT estimates generally preserve the rank ordering of participants' SSRT values, failing to account for context independence violations can lead to erroneous inferences in several realistic scenarios. Nonetheless, as the BEESTS-ABCD model can be used to accurately recover estimates of SSRT and other mechanistic parameters of interest from ABCD data, the impact of such violations can be effectively mitigated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">AJILE12: Long-term naturalistic human intracranial neural recordings and pose</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of human movement in naturalistic scenarios is critical for expanding neuroscience research beyond constrained laboratory paradigms. Here, we describe our Annotated Joints in Long-term Electrocorticography for 12 human participants (AJILE12) dataset, the largest human neurobehavioral dataset that is publicly available; the dataset was recorded opportunistically during passive clinical epilepsy monitoring. AJILE12 includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic movements, along with relevant metadata, including thousands of wrist movement events and annotated behavioral states. Neural recordings are available at 500 Hz from at least 64 electrodes per participant, for a total of 1280 hours. Pose trajectories at 9 upper-body keypoints were estimated from 118 million video frames. To facilitate data exploration and reuse, we have shared AJILE12 on The DANDI Archive in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) data standard and developed a browser-based dashboard.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alzheimer's Disease Classification Accuracy is Improved by MRI Harmonization based on Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Networks</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60% of dementia cases worldwide; patients with the disease typically suffer from irreversible memory loss and progressive decline in multiple cognitive domains. With brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), microscopic brain changes are detectable even before abnormal memory loss is detected clinically. Patterns of brain atrophy can be measured using MRI, which gives us an opportunity to facilitate AD detection using image classification techniques. Even so, MRI scanning protocols and scanners differ across studies. The resulting differences in image contrast and signal to noise make it important to train and test classification models on multiple datasets, and to handle shifts in image characteristics across protocols (also known as domain transfer or domain adaptation). Here, we examined whether adversarial domain adaptation can boost the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify AD. To test this, we used an Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to harmonize images from three publicly available brain MRI datasets - ADNI, AIBL and OASIS - adjusting for scanner-dependent effects. Our AG-GAN optimized a joint objective function that included attention loss, pixel loss, cycle-consistency loss and adversarial loss; the model was trained bidirectionally in an end-to-end fashion. For AD classification, we adapted the popular 2D AlexNet CNN to handle 3D images. Classification based on harmonized MR images significantly outperformed classification based on the three datasets in non-harmonized form, motivating further work on image harmonization using adversarial techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TCF12 controls oligodendroglial cell proliferation and regulates signaling pathways conserved in gliomas</a></h4>

              
                Diffuse gliomas are primary brain tumors originating from the transformation of glial cells. In particular, oligodendrocyte precursor cells constitute the major tumor-amplifying population in the gliomagenic process. We previously identified the TCF12 gene, encoding a transcription factor of the E protein family, as being recurrently mutated in oligodendrogliomas. In this study, we sought to understand the function of TCF12 in oligodendroglial cells, the glioma lineage of origin. We first describe TCF12 mRNA and protein expression pattern in oligodendroglial development in the mouse brain. Second, by TCF12 genome wide chromatin profiling in oligodendroglial cells, we show that TCF12 binds active promoters of genes involved in proliferation, translation/ribosomes, and pathways involved in oligodendrocyte development and cancer. Finally, we perform OPC-specific Tcf12 inactivation in vivo and demonstrate by immunofluorescence and transcriptomic analyses that TCF12 is transiently required for OPC proliferation but dispensable for oligodendrocyte differentiation. We further show that Tcf12 inactivation results in deregulation of biological processes that are also altered in oligodendrogliomas. Together, our data suggest that TCF12 directly regulates transcriptional programs in oligodendroglia development that are relevant in a glioma context.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract
      </h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale (CCAS-S) was designed to detect specific cognitive dysfunctions in cerebellar patients but is scarcely validated in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The objective of this study is to determine the usefulness of the CCAS-S in a Cuban cohort of SCA2 patients and the relationship of its scores with disease severity. The original scale underwent a forward and backward translation into Spanish language, followed by a pilot study to evaluate its comprehensibility. Reliability, discriminant, and convergent validity assessments were conducted in 64 SCA2 patients and 64 healthy controls matched for sex, age, and education. Fifty patients completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. The CCAS-S showed an acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.74) while its total raw score and the number of failed tests showed excellent (ICC = 0.94) and good (ICC = 0.89) test–retest reliability, respectively. Based on original cut-offs, the sensitivity of CCAS-S to detect possible/probable/definite CCAS was notably high (100%/100%/91%), but specificities were low (6%/30/64%) because the decreased specificity observed in four items. CCAS-S performance was significantly influenced by ataxia severity in patients and by education in both groups. CCAS-S scores correlated with MoCA scores, but showed higher sensitivity than MoCA to detect cognitive impairments in patients. The CCAS-S is particularly useful to detect cognitive impairments in SCA2 but some transcultural and/or age and education-dependent adaptations could be necessary to improve its diagnostic properties. Furthermore, this scale confirmed the parallelism between cognitive and motor deficits in SCA2, giving better insights into the disease pathophysiology and identifying novel outcomes for clinical trials.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">A rapid increase in the number of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is expected over the next decades. Accordingly, there is a critical need for early-stage AD detection methods that can enable effective treatment strategies. In this study, we consider the ability of episodic-memory measures to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD conversion and thus, detect early-stage AD. For our analysis, we studied 307 participants with MCI across four years using data from the <em class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</em> (ADNI). Using a binary logistic regression, we compared episodic-memory tests to each other and to prominent neuroimaging methods in MCI converter (MCI participants who developed AD) and MCI non-converter groups (MCI participants who did not develop AD). We also combined variables to test the accuracy of mixed-predictor models. Our results indicated that the best predictors of MCI to AD conversion were the following: a combined episodic-memory and neuroimaging model in year one (59.8%), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test in year two (71.7%), a mixed episodic-memory predictor model in year three (77.7%) and the Logical Memory Test in year four (77.2%) of ADNI. Overall, we found that individual episodic-memory measure and mixed models performed similarly when predicting MCI to AD conversion. Comparatively, individual neuroimaging measures predicted MCI conversion worse than chance. Accordingly, our results indicate that episodic-memory tests could be instrumental in detecting early-stage AD and enabling effective treatment.</p>

	<p>There is currently limited and mixed evidence for the cognitive benefits of Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) and yoga in persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (pwMCI). The objective of this study was to investigate the benefit of computerized cognitive training (CCT) vs. physical (yoga) intervention on cognitive abilities. Participants in this study were part of the larger Mayo Clinic’s Healthy Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program comparative effectiveness trial. The HABIT program is designed for pwMCI and their care partner and consists of five behavioral interventions: CCT, Memory Support System-Calendar (MSS-Calendar), wellness education, support groups, and yoga. The subtractive study design randomly withheld one of the interventions for a total of five study arms. Longitudinal mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate the hypothesis that CCT and yoga has a greater positive impact on psychomotor and basic attention abilities at 12 months post-intervention as compared to the other HABIT interventions. Findings showed CCT had a positive impact compared to yoga on the Cogstate psychomotor/attention composite at 12 months post-intervention (ES = 0.54; unadjusted p value = 0.007, adjusted p value = 0.021). The impact of yoga or combining CCT with yoga did not show statistically significant improvement. Continued CCT practice at home showed further benefit on psychomotor/attention at 12 months post-intervention. There was no significant benefit of CCT or yoga on Cogstate learning/working memory composite.</p>

	<p>We conducted a visual world eye-tracking experiment with highly proficient Spanish-English bilingual adults to investigate the effects of relative language dominance, operationalized as a continuous, multidimensional variable, on the time course of relative clause processing in the first-learned language, Spanish. We found that participants exhibited two distinct processing preferences: a semantically driven preference to assign agency to referents of lexically animate noun phrases and a syntactically driven preference to interpret relative clauses as subject-extracted. Spanish dominance was found to exert a distinct influence on each of these preferences, gradiently attenuating the semantic preference while gradiently exaggerating the syntactic preference. While these results might be attributable to particular properties of Spanish and English, they also suggest a possible generalization that greater dominance in a language increases reliance on language-specific syntactic processing strategies while correspondingly decreasing reliance on more domain-general semantic processing strategies.</p>

	<p>Dyslexic adolescents demonstrate deficits in word decoding, recognition, and oculomotor coordination as compared to healthy controls. Our lab recently showed intrinsic deficits in large saccades and vergence movements with a Remobi device independent from reading. This shed new light on the field of dyslexia, as it has been debated in the literature whether the deficits in eye movements are a cause or consequence of reading difficulty. The present study investigates how these oculomotor problems are compensated for or aggravated by text difficulty. A total of 46 dyslexic and 41 non-dyslexic adolescents’ eye movements were analyzed while reading L’Alouette, a dyslexia screening test, and 35 Kilos D’Espoir, a children’s book with a reading age of 10 years. While reading the more difficult text, dyslexics made more mistakes, read slower, and made more regressive saccades; moreover, they made smaller amplitude saccades with abnormal velocity profiles (e.g., higher peak velocity but lower average velocity) and significantly higher saccade disconjugacy. While reading the simpler text, these differences persisted; however, the difference in saccade disconjugacy, although present, was no longer significant, nor was there a significant difference in the percentage of regressive saccades. We propose that intrinsic eye movement abnormalities in dyslexics such as saccade disconjugacy, abnormal velocity profiles, and cognitively associated regressive saccades can be particularly exacerbated if the reading text relies heavily on word decoding to extract meaning; increased number of regressive saccades are a manifestation of reading difficulty and not a problem of eye movement per se. These interpretations are in line with the motor theory of visual attention and our previous research describing the relationship between binocular motor control, attention, and cognition that exists outside of the field of dyslexia.</p>

	<p>The restrictions imposed by the Italian government because of the coronavirus outbreak have been shown to be demanding on the Italian population. Data were collected at four different time points from 29 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and during the final follow-up survey on 12 October 2020. In the present study, we provided longitudinal evidence on the relationship between the lockdown and mental health dimensions, such as emotional state, perceived stress, and time perspective, for three age groups. The results allowed us to observe their psychological status from different perspectives at five different time points. Notably, a negative effect of the lockdown individual well-beings emerged as a trend, and differences in individual adaptation strategies to a prolonged stressful situation were observed at the follow-up. Indeed, pairwise comparisons between age groups showed that the young adult group (18–23 years old) seemed to be the most psychologically affected by the lockdown. The findings are discussed according to the most recent literature on the topic. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first longitudinal studies carried out in Italy concerning the general psychological effects of the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to examine the neural responses of children using prostheses and prosthetic simulators to better elucidate the emulation abilities of the simulators. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the neural response in five children with a congenital upper limb reduction (ULR) using a body-powered prosthesis to complete a 60 s gross motor dexterity task. The ULR group was matched with five typically developing children (TD) using their non-preferred hand and a prosthetic simulator on the same hand. The ULR group had lower activation within the primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) compared to the TD group, but nonsignificant differences in the primary somatosensory area (S1). Compared to using their non-preferred hand, the TD group exhibited significantly higher action in S1 when using the simulator, but nonsignificant differences in M1 and SMA. The non-significant differences in S1 activation between groups and the increased activation evoked by the simulator’s use may suggest rapid changes in feedback prioritization during tool use. We suggest that prosthetic simulators may elicit increased reliance on proprioceptive and tactile feedback during motor tasks. This knowledge may help to develop future prosthesis rehabilitative training or the improvement of tool-based skills.</p>

	<p>Cognitive impairment is acknowledged as a feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and the most common cognitive declines are in executive function (EF) and memory. Cognitive reserve (CR) may offer some protection against cognitive dysfunction in PD. The present study used two proxies of CR (years of education, premorbid IQ) to examine the relationship between CR and (i) EF (ii) memory in a large PD sample (n = 334). Two aspects of EF were examined, including verbal fluency and planning skills. Two aspects of verbal memory were examined, including immediate recall and delayed recall. For EF, both CR proxies significantly predicted verbal fluency, but only years of education predicted planning skills. Years of education significantly predicted immediate recall, but premorbid IQ did not. Neither CR proxy predicted delayed recall. These findings suggest that CR, in particular years of education, may contribute to EF and memory function in those with PD. A key finding of this study is the varying contribution of CR proxies to different aspects of the same cognitive domain. The findings indicate that using only one proxy has the potential to be misleading and suggest that when testing the relationship between CR and cognition, studies should include tasks that measure different aspects of the cognitive domain(s) of interest.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cilia are dynamic subcellular systems, with core structural and functional components operating in a highly coordinated manner. Since many environmental stimuli sensed by cilia are circadian in nature, it is reasonable to speculate that genes encoding cilia structural and functional components follow rhythmic circadian patterns of expression. Using computational methods and the largest spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of primates, we identified and analyzed the circadian rhythmic expression of cilia genes across 22 primate brain areas. We found that around 73% of cilia transcripts exhibited circadian rhythmicity across at least one of 22 brain regions. In 12 brain regions, cilia transcriptomes were significantly enriched with circadian oscillating transcripts, as compared to the rest of the transcriptome. The phase of the cilia circadian transcripts deviated from the phase of the majority of the background circadian transcripts, and transcripts coding for cilia basal body components accounted for the majority of cilia circadian transcripts. In addition, adjacent or functionally connected brain nuclei had large overlapping complements of circadian cilia genes. Most remarkably, cilia circadian transcripts shared across the basal ganglia nuclei and the prefrontal cortex peaked in these structures in sequential fashion that is similar to the sequential order of activation of the basal ganglia-cortical circuitry in connection with movement coordination, albeit on completely different timescales. These findings support a role for the circadian spatiotemporal orchestration of cilia gene expression in the normal physiology of the basal ganglia-cortical circuit and motor control. Studying orchestrated cilia rhythmicity in the basal ganglia-cortical circuits and other brain circuits may help develop better functional models, and shed light on the causal effects cilia functions have on these circuits and on the regulation of movement and other behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Machine Learning-Based Pipette Positional Correction for Automatic Patch Clamp In Vitro</a></h4>

              
                <p>Patch clamp electrophysiology is a common technique used in neuroscience to understand individual neuron behavior, allowing one to record current and voltage changes with superior spatiotemporal resolution compared with most electrophysiology methods. While patch clamp experiments produce high fidelity electrophysiology data, the technique is onerous and labor intensive. Despite the emergence of patch clamp systems that automate key stages in the typical patch clamp procedure, full automation remains elusive. Patch clamp pipettes can miss the target cell during automated experiments because of positioning errors in the robotic manipulators, which can easily exceed the diameter of a neuron. Further, when patching in acute brain slices, the inherent light scattering from non-uniform brain tissue can complicate pipette tip identification. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN), based on ResNet101, to identify and correct pipette positioning errors before each patch clamp attempt, thereby preventing the deleterious effects of and accumulation of positioning errors. This deep-learning-based pipette detection method enabled superior localization of the pipette within 0.62 &plusmn; 0.58 &mu;m, resulting in improved cell detection success rate and whole-cell patch clamp success rates by 71% and 59%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art cross-correlation method. Furthermore, this technique reduced the average time for pipette correction by 81%. This technique enables real-time correction of pipette position during patch clamp experiments with similar accuracy and quality of recording to manual patch clamp, making notable progress toward full human-out-of-the-loop automation for patch clamp electrophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Interlimb Transfer of Reach Adaptation Does Not Require an Intact Corpus Callosum: Evidence from Patients with Callosal Lesions and Agenesis</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Generalization of sensorimotor adaptation across limbs, known as interlimb transfer, is a well-demonstrated phenomenon in humans, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Theoretical models suggest that interlimb transfer is mediated by interhemispheric transfer of information via the corpus callosum. We thus hypothesized that lesions of the corpus callosum, especially to its midbody connecting motor, supplementary motor, and premotor areas of the two cerebral hemispheres, would impair interlimb transfer of sensorimotor adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we recruited three patients: two rare stroke patients with recent, extensive callosal lesions including the midbody and one patient with complete agenesis. A prismatic adaptation paradigm involving unconstrained arm reaching movements was designed to assess interlimb transfer from the prism-exposed dominant arm (DA) to the unexposed non-dominant arm (NDA) for each participant. Baseline results showed that spatial performance of each patient did not significantly differ from controls, for both limbs. Further, each patient adapted to the prismatic perturbation, with no significant difference in error reduction compared with controls. Crucially, interlimb transfer was found in each patient. The absolute magnitude of each patient&rsquo;s transfer did not significantly differ from controls. These findings show that sensorimotor adaptation can transfer across limbs despite extensive lesions or complete absence of the corpus callosum. Therefore, callosal pathways connecting homologous motor, premotor, and supplementary motor areas are not necessary for interlimb transfer of prismatic reach adaptation. Such interlimb transfer could be mediated by transcallosal splenium pathways (connecting parietal, temporal and visual areas), ipsilateral cortico-spinal pathways or subcortical structures such as the cerebellum.</p>

                The prevalence of Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) is increasing at an alarming rate in the world. Most of the HSV2 cases are not diagnosed properly, although a range of molecular and serological diagnoses exist. Herein, we have reported a very rapid detection method specific for HSV2 using real-time PCR. The primers specific for HSV2 were designed using the Primer-BLAST tool and 120 base pairs of the polymerase gene were amplified using real-time PCR with SYBR Green dye. The designed primer pair was found highly efficient in detecting only HSV2 DNA, but not HSV1. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for HSV2 reactions by designed primers was found to be an average of 22.55 for a standard copy number of viral DNA that may denote the efficiency of the primers. The melting temperature (Tm) of the amplicon using designed primers (82.60C) was also higher than that using reference primers (about 780C), indicating the high GC content of the amplified template. The designed primer pair will help clinicians to detect the HSV2 DNA specifically and diagnose the associated disease rapidly.

                RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely adopted affordable method for large scale gene expression profiling. However, user-friendly and versatile tools for wet-lab biologists to analyse RNA-seq data beyond standard analyses such as differential expression, are rare. Especially, the analysis of time-series data is difficult for wet-lab biologists lacking advanced computational training. Furthermore, most meta-analysis tools are tailored for model organisms and not easily adaptable to other species. With RNfuzzyApp, we provide a user-friendly, web-based R shiny app for differential expression analysis, as well as time-series analysis of RNA-seq data. RNfuzzyApp offers several methods for normalization and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, providing easy-to-use toolboxes, interactive plots and downloadable results. For time-series analysis, RNfuzzyApp presents the first web-based, fully automated pipeline for soft clustering with the Mfuzz R package, including methods to aid in cluster number selection, cluster overlap analysis, Mfuzz loop computations, as well as cluster enrichments. RNfuzzyApp is an intuitive, easy to use and interactive R shiny app for RNA-seq differential expression and time-series analysis, offering a rich selection of interactive plots, providing a quick overview of raw data and generating rapid analysis results. Furthermore, its orthology assignment, enrichment analysis, as well as ID conversion functions are accessible to non-model organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current situation of vaccine injury compensation program and a future perspective in light of COVID-19 and emerging viral diseases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vaccines have had a great impact on disease prevention and mortality reduction. Very rarely, vaccines also can result in serious adverse effects. In consideration of this fact, vaccine injury compensation programs have been implemented in many countries to compensate a vaccinee for associated adverse effects. The existing vaccine injury compensation system addresses routine immunization schemes. However, there are rising concerns about the compensation for adverse effects caused by new vaccines such as those developed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this article is to review the existing vaccine injury compensation programs in different countries. The review also highlights the necessity to include all upcoming new vaccines for COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases in the compensation schemes. Methods: Published articles relating to vaccine compensation injury programs, vaccines, injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and deaths resulting from vaccination were searched in data bases. Through a careful review of the abstracts, 25 relevant articles were selected for analysis. Results: We identified 27 countries on four continents with vaccine injury compensation schemes: 17 countries in Europe, 7 countries in Asia, the United States, a Canadian Province and New Zealand. No programs were identified in Africa and in South America. Program design, funding, and eligibility for compensation vary vastly between countries. We identified 17 countries operating well-established vaccine injury compensation programs. However, minimal information is available on numerous other countries. Conclusion: We have identified 27 countries operating vaccine injury compensation programs. In Canada, Quebec is the only province with a scheme; however, discussions are ongoing in Canada for nationwide implementation in light of COVID 19.  Study limitations include limited scientific material, which hindered our research. Additional data concerning payout for each type of injury and the number of claimants related to a specific vaccine injury worldwide could provide a more comprehensive analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Autoencoder based local T cell repertoire density can be used to classify samples and T cell receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shirit Dvorkin, Reut Levi, Yoram Louzoun</p>

Recent advances in T cell repertoire (TCR) sequencing allow for the characterization of repertoire properties, as well as the frequency and sharing of specific TCR. However, there is no efficient measure for the local density of a given TCR. TCRs are often described either through their Complementary Determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences, or theirV/J usage, or their clone size. We here show that the local repertoire density can be estimated using a combined representation of these components through distance conserving autoencoders and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). We present ELATE–an Encoder-based LocAl Tcr dEnsity and show that the resulting density of a sample can be used as a novel measure to study repertoire properties. The cross-density between two samples can be used as a similarity matrix to fully characterize samples from the same host. Finally, the same projection in combination with machine learning algorithms can be used to predict TCR-peptide binding through the local density of known TCRs binding a specific target.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanistic and data-driven reconstruction of the time-varying reproduction number: Application to the COVID-19 epidemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernard Cazelles, Clara Champagne, Benjamin Nguyen-Van-Yen, Catherine Comiskey, Elisabeta Vergu, Benjamin Roche</p>

The effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub><i>(t)</i>. Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in Ireland. We can thus estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active, around 45% in France but just 20% in Ireland. For the third wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bridging cell-scale simulations and radiologic images to explain short-time intratumoral oxygen fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica L. Kingsley, James R. Costello, Natarajan Raghunand, Katarzyna A. Rejniak</p>

Radiologic images provide a way to monitor tumor development and its response to therapies in a longitudinal and minimally invasive fashion. However, they operate on a macroscopic scale (average value per voxel) and are not able to capture microscopic scale (cell-level) phenomena. Nevertheless, to examine the causes of frequent fast fluctuations in tissue oxygenation, models simulating individual cells’ behavior are needed. Here, we provide a link between the average data values recorded for radiologic images and the cellular and vascular architecture of the corresponding tissues. Using hybrid agent-based modeling, we generate a set of tissue morphologies capable of reproducing oxygenation levels observed in radiologic images. We then use these in silico tissues to investigate whether oxygen fluctuations can be explained by changes in vascular oxygen supply or by modulations in cellular oxygen absorption. Our studies show that intravascular changes in oxygen supply reproduce the observed fluctuations in tissue oxygenation in all considered regions of interest. However, larger-magnitude fluctuations cannot be recreated by modifications in cellular absorption of oxygen in a biologically feasible manner. Additionally, we develop a procedure to identify plausible tissue morphologies for a given temporal series of average data from radiology images. In future applications, this approach can be used to generate a set of tissues comparable with radiology images and to simulate tumor responses to various anti-cancer treatments at the tissue-scale level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explaining distortions in metacognition with an attractor network model of decision uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nadim A. A. Atiya, Quentin J. M. Huys, Raymond J. Dolan, Stephen M. Fleming</p>

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, and evaluate, our cognition and behaviour. Distortions in metacognition are common in mental health disorders, though the neural underpinnings of such dysfunction are unknown. One reason for this is that models of key components of metacognition, such as decision confidence, are generally specified at an algorithmic or process level. While such models can be used to relate brain function to psychopathology, they are difficult to map to a neurobiological mechanism. Here, we develop a biologically-plausible model of decision uncertainty in an attempt to bridge this gap. We first relate the model’s uncertainty in perceptual decisions to standard metrics of metacognition, namely mean confidence level (bias) and the accuracy of metacognitive judgments (sensitivity). We show that dissociable shifts in metacognition are associated with isolated disturbances at higher-order levels of a circuit associated with self-monitoring, akin to neuropsychological findings that highlight the detrimental effect of prefrontal brain lesions on metacognitive performance. Notably, we are able to account for empirical confidence judgements by fitting the parameters of our biophysical model to first-order performance data, specifically choice and response times. Lastly, in a reanalysis of existing data we show that self-reported mental health symptoms relate to disturbances in an uncertainty-monitoring component of the network. By bridging a gap between a biologically-plausible model of confidence formation and observed disturbances of metacognition in mental health disorders we provide a first step towards mapping theoretical constructs of metacognition onto dynamical models of decision uncertainty. In doing so, we provide a computational framework for modelling metacognitive performance in settings where access to explicit confidence reports is not possible.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dimeric allostery mechanism of the plant circadian clock photoreceptor ZEITLUPE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Francesco Trozzi, Feng Wang, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain containing protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) integrates light quality, intensity, and duration into regulation of the circadian clock. Recent structural and biochemical studies of ZTL indicate that the protein diverges from other members of the LOV superfamily in its allosteric mechanism, and that the divergent allosteric mechanism hinges upon conservation of two signaling residues G46 and V48 that alter dynamic motions of a Gln residue implicated in signal transduction in all LOV proteins. Here, we delineate the allosteric mechanism of ZTL via an integrated computational approach that employs atomistic simulations of wild type and allosteric variants of ZTL in the functional dark and light states, together with Markov state and supervised machine learning classification models. This approach has unveiled key factors of the ZTL allosteric mechanisms, and identified specific interactions and residues implicated in functional allosteric changes. The final results reveal atomic level insights into allosteric mechanisms of ZTL function that operate via a non-trivial combination of population-shift and dynamics-driven allosteric pathways.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Insights into substrate recognition and specificity for IgG by Endoglycosidase S2</a></h4>

Antibodies bind foreign antigens with high affinity and specificity leading to their neutralization and/or clearance by the immune system. The conserved N-glycan on IgG has significant impact on antibody effector function, with the endoglycosidases of <i>Streptococcus pyogen</i>es deglycosylating the IgG to evade the immune system, a process catalyzed by the endoglycosidase EndoS2. Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2 to the proteins’ catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and multi-microsecond MD simulations. Modeling results predict that EndoS2 initially interacts with the IgG through its CBM followed by interactions with the GH yielding catalytically competent states. These may involve the CBM and GH of EndoS2 simultaneously interacting with either the same Fc CH2/CH3 domain or individually with the two Fc CH2/CH3 domains, with EndoS2 predicted to assume closed conformations in the former case and open conformations in the latter. Apo EndoS2 is predicted to sample both the open and closed states, suggesting that either complex can directly form following initial IgG-EndoS2 encounter. Interactions of the CBM and GH domains with the IgG are predicted to occur through both its glycan and protein regions. Simulations also predict that the Fc glycan can directly transfer from the CBM to the GH, facilitating formation of catalytically competent complexes and how the 734 to 751 loop on the CBM can facilitate extraction of the glycan away from the Fc CH2/CH3 domain. The predicted models are compared and consistent with Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange data. In addition, the complex models are consistent with the high specificity of EndoS2 for the glycans on IgG supporting the validity of the predicted models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Projecting contact matrices in 177 geographical regions: An update and comparison with empirical data for the COVID-19 era</a></h4>

Mathematical models have played a key role in understanding the spread of directly-transmissible infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as the effectiveness of public health responses. As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices show qualitative similarities to the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IVEN: A quantitative tool to describe 3D cell position and neighbourhood reveals architectural changes in FGF4-treated preimplantation embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jessica E. Forsyth, Ali H. Al-Anbaki, Roberto de la Fuente, Nikkinder Modare, Diego Perez-Cortes, Isabel Rivera, Rowena Seaton Kelly, Simon Cotter, Berenika Plusa</p>

Architectural changes at the cellular and organism level are integral and necessary to successful development and growth. During mammalian preimplantation development, cells reduce in size and the architecture of the embryo changes significantly. Such changes must be coordinated correctly to ensure continued development of the embryo and, ultimately, a successful pregnancy. However, the nature of such transformations is poorly defined during mammalian preimplantation development. In order to quantitatively describe changes in cell environment and organism architecture, we designed Internal Versus External Neighbourhood (IVEN). IVEN is a user-interactive, open-source pipeline that classifies cells into different populations based on their position and quantifies the number of neighbours of every cell within a dataset in a 3D environment. Through IVEN-driven analyses, we show how transformations in cell environment, defined here as changes in cell neighbourhood, are related to changes in embryo geometry and major developmental events during preimplantation mammalian development. Moreover, we demonstrate that modulation of the FGF pathway alters spatial relations of inner cells and neighbourhood distributions, leading to overall changes in embryo architecture. In conjunction with IVEN-driven analyses, we uncover differences in the dynamic of cell size changes over the preimplantation period and determine that cells within the mammalian embryo initiate growth phase only at the time of implantation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Classification of small ruminant lentivirus subtype A2, subgroups 1 and 2 based on whole genome comparisons and complex recombination patterns [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) cause a multisystemic chronic wasting disease in sheep across much of the world. SRLV subtype A2 is prevalent in North America and further classified into multiple subgroups based on variation in the group antigens gene (gag) and envelope (env) genes. In sheep, the ovine transmembrane protein 154 (TMEM154) gene is associated with SRLV susceptibility. Ewes with at least one copy of TMEM154 encoding a full-length protein with glutamate at position 35 (E35; haplotypes 2 and 3), are highly susceptible to SRLV infection while ewes with any combination of TMEM154 haplotypes which encodes lysine (K35; haplotype 1), or truncated proteins (haplotypes 4 and 6) are several times less so. A2 subgroups 1 and 2 are associated with host TMEM154 genotypes; subgroup 1 with the K35/K35 genotype and subgroup 2 with the E35/E35 genotype. Methods:  Sequence variation within and among full-length assemblies of SRLV subtype A2 subgroups 1 and 2 was analyzed to identify genome-scale recombination patterns and subgroup-specific variants. Results:  Consensus viral genomes were assembled from 23 infected sheep, including animals of assorted TMEM154 genotypes comprised of haplotypes 1, 2, or 3. Viral genome analysis identified viral subgroups 1 and 2 among the samples, and revealed additional sub-structure within subgroup 2 based on models predicting complex patterns of recombination between the two subgroups in several genomes. Animals with evidence of dual subgroup infection also possessed the most diverse quasi-species and the most highly recombined consensus genomes. After accounting for recombination, 413 subgroup diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Conclusions:  The viral subgroup framework developed to classify SRLV consensus genomes along a continuum of recombination suggests that animals with the TMEM154 E35/K35 genotype may represent a reservoir for producing viral genomes representing recombination between A2 subgroups 1 and 2.
