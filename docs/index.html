Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.

Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.

Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11688">Disrupted core-periphery structure of multimodal brain networks in Alzheimer's Disease. (arXiv:1811.11688v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are recognized to include a disconnection
syndrome initiated by the neuronal atrophy process. In Alzheimer's disease
(AD), the progressive destruction of axonal pathways leads to aberrant network
reconfigurations both at the structural and functional level. In such network
reorganization, the core and peripheral nodes appear to be crucial for the
prediction of clinical outcome due to their ability to influence large-scale
functional integration. However, the role of the different types of brain
connectivity in such prediction still remains unclear. Using a multiplex
network approach we integrated information from DWI, fMRI and MEG brain
connectivity to extract an enriched description of the core-periphery structure
in a group of AD patients and age-matched controls. Results showed that the
regional coreness - i.e., the probability of a region to be in the multiplex
core - was mainly driven by DWI structural connectivity with significant
contributions of fMRI and MEG functional connectivity, respectively at 0.1-0.3
Hz and 8-10 Hz. At the global scale, we showed that the coreness significantly
decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process initiated by
the neurodegeneration. At the local scale, the most impacted areas were in the
core of the network - including temporal, parietal and occipital areas - while
we reported compensatory increments for the peripheral regions in the
sensorimotor system. Finally, these multiplex network changes significantly
predicted the cognitive and memory impairment of patients as measured
respectively by the MMSE and FCSRT clinical scores. Taken together these
results indicate that a more accurate description of neurodegenerative diseases
can be obtained from the multimodal integration of neuroimaging-derived network

<p>Slow waves (SWs) occur both during natural sleep and anesthesia and are
universal across species. Even though electrophysiological recordings have been
largely used to characterize brain states, they are limited in the spatial
resolution and cannot target specific neuronal population. Recently,
large-scale optical imaging techniques coupled with functional indicators
overcame these restrictions. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence
microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator
(GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study SW propagation over the meso-scale
under ketamine anesthesia. We developed "de novo" a versatile analysis pipeline
to quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of the SWs in the frequency band
[0.5, 4] Hz. Moreover, we designed a computational simulator based on a simple
theoretical model, which takes into account the statistics of neural activity,
the response of fluorescence proteins and the slow waves dynamics. The
simulator was capable of synthesizing artificial signals that could reliably
reproduce several features of the SWs observed in vivo. Comparison of
preliminary experimental and simulated data shows the robustness of the
analysis tools and its potential to uncover mechanistic insights of the Slow
Wave Activity (SWA).

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical
reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral
cortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory
thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory
thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to
neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have
reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral
geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual
movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated
with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is
highly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that
were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the
hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left
MGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).
Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates
with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging based probabilistic
tracking we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced
structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the
first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with
faster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers. Our findings
provide first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the
auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia, and that it may also
impact on reading related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.

<p>Resting-state functional Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-fASL) in clinical daily
practice and academic research stay discreet compared to resting-state BOLD.
However, by giving direct access to cerebral blood flow maps, rs-fASL leads to
significant clinical subject scaled application as CBF can be considered as a
biomarker in common neuropathology. Our work here focuses on the link between
overall quality of rs-fASL and duration of acquisition. To this end, we
consider subject self-Default Mode Network (DMN), and assess DMN quality
depletion compared to a gold standard DMN depending on the duration of
acquisition.

<p>Computational models of the respiratory central pattern generator (rCPG) are
usually based on biologically-plausible Hodgkin Huxley neuron models. Such
models require numerous parameters and thus are prone to overfitting. The HH
approach is motivated by the assumption that the biophysical properties of
neurons determine the network dynamics. Here, we implement the rCPG using
simpler Izhikevich resonate-and-fire neurons. Our rCPG model generates a
3-phase respiratory motor pattern based on established connectivities and can
reproduce previous experimental and theoretical observations. Further, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the model by testing whether intrinsic bursting
properties are necessary for rhythmogenesis. Our simulations demonstrate that
replacing predicted mandatory bursting properties of pre-inspiratory neurons
with spike adapting properties yields a model that generates comparable
respiratory activity patterns. The latter supports our view that the importance
of the exact modeling parameters of specific respiratory neurons is
overestimated.

<p>by Hillary Koch, Dmytro Starenki, Sara J. Cooper, Richard M. Myers, Qunhua Li</p>

Sequencing of the T cell receptor repertoire is a powerful tool for deeper study of immune response, but the unique structure of this type of data makes its meaningful quantification challenging. We introduce a new method, the Gamma-GPD spliced threshold model, to address this difficulty. This biologically interpretable model captures the distribution of the TCR repertoire, demonstrates stability across varying sequencing depths, and permits comparative analysis across any number of sampled individuals. We apply our method to several datasets and obtain insights regarding the differentiating features in the T cell receptor repertoire among sampled individuals across conditions. We have implemented our method in the open-source R package powerTCR.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1HPkiYuzOtM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,349 Japanese community‐residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002‐2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all P for trend &lt;0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR=2.03, 95% CI=1.39‐2.97, P&lt;0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.02‐2.55, P=0.04 for AD; HR=2.85, 95% CI=1.35‐6.02, P=0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk‐factor subgroups (all P for heterogeneity &gt;0.11).</p>


<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p>

<p>The koniocellular (K) layers of the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus house a variety of visual receptive field types, not all of which have been fully characterized. Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We characterize cells in an evolutionary ancient part of the visual pathway in primates. The cells are located in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the main visual afferent relay nucleus), in regions called koniocellular layers that are known to project to extrastriate visual areas as well as primary visual cortex. The cells show high contrast sensitivity and rapid, transient responses to light onset and offset. Their properties suggest they could contribute to visual processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10371?rss=1">Cerebellar Role in Predictive Control of Eye Velocity Initiation and Termination</a></h4>

<p>Predictive motor control is essential to achieve rapid and precise motor action in all vertebrates. Visuomotor transformations have been a popular model system to study the underlying neural mechanisms, in particular, the role of the cerebellum in both predictive and gain adaptations. In all species, large-field visual motion produces an involuntary conjugate ocular movement facilitating gaze stabilization called the optokinetic response. Gain adaptation can be induced by prolonged optokinetic visual stimulation; and if the visual stimulation is temporally periodic, predictive behavior emerges. Two predictive timing components were identifiable in this behavior. The first was prediction of stimulus initiation (when to move) and the other was stimulus termination (when to stop). We designed visual training that allowed us to evaluate initiation and termination independently that included the recording of cerebellar activity followed by acute and chronic cerebellar removal in goldfish of both sexes. We found that initiation and termination predictions were present in the cerebellum and more robust than conflicting visual sensory signals. Each prediction could be acquired independently, and both the acquisition and maintenance of each component were cerebellar-dependent. Subsequent analysis of the neuronal connectivity strongly supports the hypothesis that the acquired eye velocity behaviors were dependent on feedforward velocity buildup signals from the brainstem, but the adaptive timing mechanism itself originates within the circuitry of the cerebellum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predictive and rapid motor control is essential in our daily life, such as in the playing of musical instruments or sports. The current work evaluates timing of a visuomotor behavior shown to be similar in humans as well as goldfish. Given the latter species' known brainstem cerebellar neuronal connectivity and experimental advantage, it was possible to demonstrate the cerebellum to be necessary for acquisition and maintenance of both the initiation and termination components of when to move and to stop. All evidence in this study points to the adaptive predictive control site to lie within the cerebellar circuitry.</p>

<p>Reward-related stimuli can potently influence behavior; for example, exposure to drug-paired cues can trigger drug use and relapse in people with addictions. Psychological mechanisms that generate such outcomes likely include cue-induced cravings and attentional biases. Recent animal data suggest another candidate mechanism: reward-paired cues can enhance risky decision making, yet whether this translates to humans is unknown. Here, we examined whether sensory reward-paired cues alter decision making under uncertainty and risk, as measured respectively by the Iowa Gambling Task and a two-choice lottery task. In the cued versions of both tasks, gain feedback was augmented with reward-concurrent audiovisual stimuli. Healthy human volunteers (53 males, 78 females) performed each task once, one with and the other without cues (cued Iowa Gambling Task/uncued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 63; uncued Iowa Gambling Task/cued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 68), with concurrent eye-tracking. Reward-paired cues did not affect choice on the Iowa Gambling Task. On the two-choice lottery task, the cued group displayed riskier choice and reduced sensitivity to probability information. The cued condition was associated with reduced eye fixations on probability information shown on the screen and greater pupil dilation related to decision and reward anticipation. This pupil effect was unrelated to the risk-promoting effects of cues: the degree of pupil dilation for risky versus risk-averse choices did not differ as a function of cues. Together, our data show that sensory reward cues can promote riskier decisions and have additional and distinct effects on arousal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal data suggest that reward-paired cues can promote maladaptive reward-seeking by biasing cost-benefit decision making. Whether this finding translates to humans is unknown. We examined the effects of salient reward-paired audiovisual cues on decision making under risk and uncertainty in human volunteers. Cues had risk-promoting effects on a risky choice task and independently increased task-related arousal as measured by pupil dilation. By demonstrating risk-promoting effects of cues in human participants, our data identify a mechanism whereby cue reactivity could translate into maladaptive behavioral outcomes in people with addictions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10349?rss=1">Synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Involved a Dysregulation of Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics through Cofilin 1 Phosphorylation</a></h4>

<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) drives the synaptic impairment and dendritic spine loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how Aβ affects the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown and contentious. The actin-binding protein, cofilin-1 (cof1), is a major regulator of actin dynamics in dendritic spines, and is subject to phospho-regulation by multiple pathways, including the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. While cof1 is implicated as a driver of the synaptotoxicity characteristic of the early phases of AD pathophysiology, questions remain about the molecular mechanisms involved. Cofilin-actin rods are observed in neurons exposed to Aβ oligomers (Aβo) and in tissue from AD patients, and others have described an increased cofilin phosphorylation (p-cof1) in AD patients. Here, we report elevated p-cof1 of the postsynaptic enriched fraction of synaptosomes from cortical samples of male APP/PS1 mice and human AD cases of either sex. In primary cortical neurons, Aβo induced rapid actin stabilization and increased p-cof1 in the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses within 30 min. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of actin-GFP and calcium imaging in live neurons expressing active or inactive cof1 mutants suggest that cof1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for Aβo-induced synaptic impairment via actin stabilization before the reported formation of cofilin-actin rods. Moreover, the clinically available and well-tolerated ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevented Aβo-induced actin stabilization, synaptic impairment, and synaptic loss by blocking cofilin phosphorylation. Aβo also blocked the LTP-induced insertion of the AMPAR subunit, GluA1, at the postsynaptic density, in a fasudil-sensitive manner. These data support an important role for ROCKs and cofilin in mediating Aβ-induced synaptic impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that amyloid-β oligomers rapidly induce aberrant stabilization of F-actin within dendritic spines, which impairs synaptic strength and plasticity. Activation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway results in phosphorylation of cof1 and is sufficient to mediate Aβo-induced actin stabilization synaptic impairment and synaptic loss. Further, the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevents cofilin phosphorylation, acute synaptic disruption, and synaptotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. Together, the herein presented data provide strong support for further study of the ROCK pathway as a therapeutic target for the cognitive decline and synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>The extent to which subjective awareness influences reward processing, and thereby affects future decisions, is currently largely unknown. In the present report, we investigated this question in a reinforcement learning framework, combining perceptual masking, computational modeling, and electroencephalographic recordings (human male and female participants). Our results indicate that degrading the visibility of the reward decreased, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increased their tendency to repeat previous choices. We dissociated electrophysiological signatures evoked by the reward-based learning processes from those elicited by the reward-independent repetition of previous choices and showed that these neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, this report sheds new light on the neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making and highlights that awareness is beneficial for the trial-by-trial adjustment of decision-making strategies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The notion of reward is strongly associated with subjective evaluation, related to conscious processes such as "pleasure," "liking," and "wanting." Here we show that degrading reward visibility in a reinforcement learning task decreases, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increases subjects' tendency to repeat previous choices. Electrophysiological recordings, in combination with computational modeling, show that neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, we dissociate different neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making, which highlights a beneficial role of reward awareness in adjusting decision-making strategies.</p>

<p>Botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) is an effective treatment for several movement disorders, including spasticity and dystonia. BoNT/A acts by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction, thus blocking synaptic transmission and weakening overactive muscles. However, not all the therapeutic benefits of the neurotoxin are explained by peripheral neuroparalysis, suggesting an action of BoNT/A on central circuits. Currently, the specific targets of BoNT/A central activity remain unclear. Here, we show that catalytically active BoNT/A is transported to the facial nucleus (FN) after injection into the nasolabial musculature of rats and mice. BoNT/A-mediated cleavage of SNAP-25 in the FN is prevented by intracerebroventricular delivery of antitoxin antibodies, demonstrating that BoNT/A physically leaves the motoneurons to enter second-order neurons. Analysis of intoxicated terminals within the FN shows that BoNT/A is transcytosed preferentially into cholinergic synapses. The cholinergic boutons containing cleaved SNAP-25 are associated with a larger size, suggesting impaired neuroexocytosis. Together, the present findings indicate a previously unrecognized source of reduced motoneuron drive after BoNT/A via blockade of central, excitatory cholinergic inputs. These data highlight the ability of BoNT/A to selectively target and modulate specific central circuits, with consequent impact on its therapeutic effectiveness in movement disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Botulinum neurotoxins are among the most potent toxins known. Despite this, their specific and reversible action prompted their use in clinical practice to treat several neuromuscular pathologies (dystonia, spasticity, muscle spasms) characterized by hyperexcitability of peripheral nerve terminals or even in nonpathological applications (i.e., cosmetic use). Substantial experimental and clinical evidence indicates that not all botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) effects can be explained solely by the local action (i.e., silencing of the neuromuscular junction). In particular, there are cases in which the clinical benefit exceeds the duration of peripheral neurotransmission blockade. In this study, we demonstrate that BoNT/A is transported to facial motoneurons, released, and internalized preferentially into cholinergic terminals impinging onto the motoneurons. Our data demonstrate a direct central action of BoNT/A.</p>

<p>Task- and phase-dependent reflex modulation during locomotion is well established, but we do not know the signals driving this modulation. To determine whether signals related to left–right symmetry of the locomotor pattern modulate cutaneous reflexes, we stimulated the superficial peroneal nerve in five intact female cats and in four spinal-transected cats (spinal cats, two males and two females) during split-belt locomotion at different left–right speeds. We compared cutaneous reflexes evoked in three ipsilateral and two contralateral hindlimb muscles during split-belt locomotion with those evoked during tied-belt (equal left–right speeds) locomotion at matched speeds of the slow and fast limbs. Our results showed similar phase-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes during tied-belt and split-belt locomotion in intact and spinal cats. During tied-belt locomotion in intact cats, an increase in speed significantly increased reflex modulation from minimum to maximum values, whereas in spinal cats, we observed a significant decrease. However, in all muscles of intact and spinal cats, split-belt locomotion significantly reduced reflex modulation compared with tied-belt locomotion independently of which limb was stepping on the slow or fast belt. Additionally, reflex modulation correlated more with spatial left–right symmetry, as opposed to a temporal one, in intact and spinal cats. Our results indicate that signals related to left–right symmetry reduce cutaneous reflex modulation independently of speed via a spinal mechanism. We propose that asymmetric sensory feedback from the left and right legs alters the state of the spinal network, thereby reducing cutaneous reflexes to prevent inputs from destabilizing a potentially unstable pattern.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When we contact an obstacle during walking, receptors in the skin send signals to the CNS to alter the trajectory of the leg to maintain balance. This response, or reflex, is different when the leg is in the air and when it is contacting the ground. The reflex also differs when we walk at different speeds. Here, we investigated this reflex when the left and right legs were walking at different speeds on a split-belt treadmill in cats. We show that the reflex is smaller during split-belt locomotion compared with when both legs are walking at equal speeds. We propose that the spinal locomotor network controlling walking reduces the reflex response to optimize balance when gait is unstable.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen a large number of neuroimaging studies focused on the anticorrelated functional relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). Due principally to the low temporal resolution of functional neuroimaging modalities, the fast-neuronal dynamics across these networks remain poorly understood. Here we report novel human intracranial electrophysiology data from six neurosurgical patients (four males) with simultaneous coverage of well characterized nodes of the DMN and DAN. Subjects performed an arithmetic processing task, shown previously to evoke reliable deactivations (below baseline) in the DMN, and activations in the DAN. In this cohort, we show that DMN deactivations lag DAN activations by approximately 200 ms. Our findings suggest a clear temporal order of processing across the two networks during the current task and place the DMN further than the DAN in a plausible information-processing hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain contains an intrinsic and strictly organized network architecture. Our understanding of the interplay across association networks has relied primarily on the slow fluctuations of the hemodynamic response, and as such it has lacked essential evidence regarding the temporal dynamics of activity across these networks. The current study presents evidence from high spatiotemporal methods showing that well studied areas of the default mode network display delayed task-induced activity relative to divergent responses in dorsal attention network nodes. This finding provides direct and critical evidence regarding the temporal chronology of neuronal events across opposing brain networks.</p>

<p>When entering an environment, we can use the present visual information from the scene to either recognize the kind of place it is (e.g., a kitchen or a bedroom) or navigate through it. Here we directly test the hypothesis that these two processes, what we call "scene categorization" and "visually-guided navigation", are supported by dissociable neural systems. Specifically, we manipulated task demands by asking human participants (male and female) to perform a scene categorization, visually-guided navigation, and baseline task on images of scenes, and measured both the average univariate responses and multivariate spatial pattern of responses within two scene-selective cortical regions, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA), hypothesized to be separably involved in scene categorization and visually-guided navigation, respectively. As predicted, in the univariate analysis, PPA responded significantly more during the categorization task than during both the navigation and baseline tasks, whereas OPA showed the complete opposite pattern. Similarly, in the multivariate analysis, a linear support vector machine achieved above-chance classification for the categorization task, but not the navigation task in PPA. By contrast, above-chance classification was achieved for both the navigation and categorization tasks in OPA. However, above-chance classification for both tasks was also found in early visual cortex and hence not specific to OPA, suggesting that the spatial patterns of responses in OPA are merely inherited from early vision, and thus may be epiphenomenal to behavior. Together, these results are evidence for dissociable neural systems involved in recognizing places and navigating through them.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been nearly three decades since Goodale and Milner demonstrated that recognizing objects and manipulating them involve distinct neural processes. Today we show the same is true of our interactions with our environment: recognizing places and navigating through them are neurally dissociable. More specifically, we found that a scene-selective region, the parahippocampal place area, is active when participants are asked to categorize a scene, but not when asked to imagine navigating through it, whereas another scene-selective region, the occipital place area, shows the exact opposite pattern. This double dissociation is evidence for dissociable neural systems within scene processing, similar to the bifurcation of object processing described by Goodale and Milner (1992).</p>

<p>In mammals respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and nonhuman animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a 1 h awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared with mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared with the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10271?rss=1">Tropomodulin Isoform-Specific Regulation of Dendrite Development and Synapse Formation</a></h4>

<p>Neurons of the CNS elaborate highly branched dendritic arbors that host numerous dendritic spines, which serve as the postsynaptic platform for most excitatory synapses. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in dendrite development and spine formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Tropomodulins (Tmods) are a family of actin-binding proteins that cap the slow-growing (pointed) end of actin filaments, thereby regulating the stability, length, and architecture of complex actin networks in diverse cell types. Three members of the Tmod family, Tmod1, Tmod2, and Tmod3 are expressed in the vertebrate CNS, but their function in neuronal development is largely unknown. In this study, we present evidence that Tmod1 and Tmod2 exhibit distinct roles in regulating spine development and dendritic arborization, respectively. Using rat hippocampal tissues from both sexes, we find that Tmod1 and Tmod2 are expressed with distinct developmental profiles: Tmod2 is expressed early during hippocampal development, whereas Tmod1 expression coincides with synaptogenesis. We then show that knockdown of Tmod2, but not Tmod1, severely impairs dendritic branching. Both Tmod1 and Tmod2 are localized to a distinct subspine region where they regulate local F-actin stability. However, the knockdown of Tmod1, but not Tmod2, disrupts spine morphogenesis and impairs synapse formation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by different members of the Tmod family plays an important role in distinct aspects of dendrite and spine development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Tropomodulin family of molecules is best known for controlling the length and stability of actin myofilaments in skeletal muscles. While several Tropomodulin members are expressed in the brain, fundamental knowledge about their role in neuronal function is limited. In this study, we show the unique expression profile and subcellular distribution of Tmod1 and Tmod2 in hippocampal neurons. While both Tmod1 and Tmod2 regulate F-actin stability, we find that they exhibit isoform-specific roles in dendrite development and synapse formation: Tmod2 regulates dendritic arborization, whereas Tmod1 is required for spine development and synapse formation. These findings provide novel insight into the actin regulatory mechanisms underlying neuronal development, thereby shedding light on potential pathways disrupted in a number of neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Brainstem locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) are among the first neurons across the lifespan to evidence tau pathology, and LCn are implicated in tau propagation throughout the cortices. Yet, events influencing LCn tau are poorly understood. Activated persistently across wakefulness, LCn experience significant metabolic stress in response to chronic short sleep (CSS). Here we explored whether CSS influences LCn tau and the biochemical, neuroanatomical, and/or behavioral progression of tauopathy in male and female P301S mice. CSS in early adult life advanced the temporal progression of neurobehavioral impairments and resulted in a lasting increase in soluble tau oligomers. Intriguingly, CSS resulted in an early increase in AT8 and MC1 tau pathology in the LC. Over time tau pathology, including tangles, was evident in forebrain tau-vulnerable regions. Sustained microglial and astrocytic activation was observed as well. Remarkably, CSS resulted in significant loss of neurons in the two regions examined: the basolateral amygdala and LC. A second, distinct form of chronic sleep disruption, fragmentation of sleep, during early adult life also increased tau deposition and imparted early neurobehavioral impairment. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that early life sleep disruption has important lasting effects on the temporal progression in P301S mice, influencing tau pathology and hastening neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neurobehavioral impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic short sleep (CSS) is pervasive in modern society. Here, we found that early life CSS influences behavioral, biochemical, and neuroanatomic aspects of the temporal progression of tauopathy in a mouse model of the P301S tau mutation. Specifically, CSS hastened the onset of motor impairment and resulted in a greater loss of neurons in both the locus ceruleus and basolateral/lateral amygdala. Importantly, despite a protracted recovery opportunity after CSS, mice evidenced a sustained increase in pathogenic tau oligomers, and increased pathogenic tau in the locus ceruleus and limbic system nuclei. These findings unveil early life sleep habits as an important determinant in the progression of tauopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10244?rss=1">Differentiation of Human Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity Underlies Long-Term Resistance to Forgetting in Memory</a></h4>

<p>It is well known that distributing study events over time leads to better memory over long time scales, compared with massing study events together. One explanation for such long-term resistance to forgetting is that distributed study leads to neural differentiation in memory, which supports retrieval of past experiences by disambiguating highly similar memory representations. Neuroanatomical models of episodic memory retrieval propose that the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) work together to enable retrieval of behaviorally appropriate memories. However, it is not known how representations in these regions jointly support resistance to forgetting long after initial learning. Using fMRI, we measured differentiation in retrieved memory representations following an extended delay in male and female human participants. After 1 week, word–object associations were better remembered if studied across 2 d (overnight), allowing associations to be learned in distinct temporal contexts, compared with learning within a single day (same day). MPFC retrieval patterns showed differentiation for overnight relative to same day memories, whereas hippocampal patterns reflected associative retrieval success. Overnight memory differentiation in MPFC was higher for associative than item memories and higher than differentiation assessed over a brain-wide set of retrieval-active voxels. The memory-related difference in MPFC pattern differentiation correlated with memory success for overnight learning and with hippocampal–MPFC functional connectivity. These results show that learning information across days leads to differentiated MPFC memory representations, reducing forgetting after 1 week, and suggest this arises from persistent interactions between MPFC and hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has been linked to memory-related representations, but prior work has not examined how these representations support episodic memory retrieval over extended time scales that are characteristic of everyday retrieval. We show that differentiation in MPFC activity 1 week after encoding is higher for retrieved information learned across 2 d compared with within a single day. In hippocampus, differentiation was greater for detailed memory retrieval but was not influenced by whether information had been learned over 1 or 2 d. Differentiation in MPFC predicted behavioral robustness to forgetting and was correlated with hippocampal–MPFC connectivity. The results suggest that context-based differentiation supports robust long-term memory via persistent MPFC–hippocampal interactions.</p>

<p>Collective movements are pervasive behaviours among social organisms and have
led to the development of many models. However, modelling animal trajectories
and social interactions in simple bounded environments remains a challenge.
Moreover, advances in the understanding of the sensory-motor loop and the
information processing by animals are leading to revisions of the traditional
assumptions made in decision-making algorithms. In this context, we develop a
methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to describe the
collective motion of small zebrafish groups in a bounded environment. Although
ANN models are commonly used in artificial systems they are still
under-explored to model animal collective behaviours. Here, we present a
methodology to calibrate Multilayer Perceptrons by learning from real fish
experimental data. The ANNs are trained using either supervised learning or
various forms of evolutionary reinforcement learning methods (using the CMA-ES
and NSGA-III algorithms). We reveal that ANN models trained using evolutionary
methods are capable of generating realistic collective motions for groups of 5
zebrafish including the tank wall effects, a feature that is lacking in
previous models. Finally, we also discuss the benefits of optimised ANNs as
candidates for driving robotic lure with biologically realistic behaviour, a
method that is becoming increasingly popular to gather data and validate
assumptions on collective behaviours.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42870">Neural dynamics at successive stages of the ventral visual stream are consistent with hierarchical error signals</a></h4>

Ventral visual stream neural responses are dynamic, even for static image presentations. However, dynamical neural models of visual cortex are lacking as most progress has been made modeling static, time-averaged responses. Here, we studied population neural dynamics during face detection across three cortical processing stages. Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their responses to typical configurations of their preferred face parts relative to their response for atypical configurations even while neurons in higher areas achieved and maintained a preference for typical configurations. These hierarchical neural dynamics were inconsistent with standard feedforward circuits. Rather, recurrent models computing prediction errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures. This model of neural dynamics, which simply augments the standard feedforward model of online vision, suggests that neural responses to static images may encode top-down prediction errors in addition to bottom-up feature estimates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41653">The hydrophobic nature of a novel membrane interface regulates the enzyme activity of a voltage-sensing phosphatase</a></h4>

Voltage-sensing phosphatases (VSP) contain a voltage sensor domain (VSD) similar to that of voltage-gated ion channels but lack a pore-gate domain. A VSD in a VSP regulates the cytoplasmic catalytic region (CCR). However, the mechanisms by which the VSD couples to the CCR remain elusive. Here we report a membrane interface (named 'the hydrophobic spine'), which is essential for the coupling of the VSD and CCR. Our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the hydrophobic spine of <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> VSP (Ci-VSP) provides a hinge-like motion for the CCR through the loose membrane association of the phosphatase domain. Electrophysiological experiments indicate that the voltage-dependent phosphatase activity of Ci-VSP depends on the hydrophobicity and presence of an aromatic ring in the hydrophobic spine. Analysis of conformational changes in the VSD and CCR suggests that the VSP has two states with distinct enzyme activities and that the second transition depends on the hydrophobic spine.

The evolutionary increase in size and complexity of the primate neocortex is thought to underlie the higher cognitive abilities of humans. <i>ARHGAP11B</i> is a human-specific gene that, based on its expression pattern in fetal human neocortex and progenitor effects in embryonic mouse neocortex, has been proposed to have a key function in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex. Here, we study the effects of<i> ARHGAP11B</i> expression in the developing neocortex of the gyrencephalic ferret. In contrast to its effects in mouse, ARHGAP11B markedly increases proliferative basal radial glia, a progenitor cell type thought to be instrumental for neocortical expansion, and results in extension of the neurogenic period and an increase in upper-layer neurons. Consequently, the postnatal ferret neocortex exhibits increased neuron density in the upper cortical layers and expands in both the radial and tangential dimensions. Thus, human-specific ARHGAP11B can elicit hallmarks of neocortical expansion in the developing ferret neocortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41228">Plant diversity maintains multiple soil functions in future environments</a></h4>

Biodiversity increases ecosystem functions underpinning a suite of services valued by society, including services provided by soils. To test whether, and how, future environments alter the relationship between biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions, we measured grassland plant diversity effects on single soil functions and ecosystem multifunctionality, and compared relationships in four environments: ambient conditions, elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, enriched N supply, and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and N in combination. Our results showed that plant diversity increased three out of four soil functions and, consequently, ecosystem multifunctionality. Remarkably, biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships were similarly significant under current and future environmental conditions, yet weaker with enriched N supply. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced ecosystem multifunctionality by increasing plant community functional diversity, and the even provision of multiple functions. Conserving local plant diversity is therefore a robust strategy to maintain multiple valuable ecosystem services in both present and future environmental conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40126">TAPBPR mediates peptide dissociation from MHC class I using a leucine lever</a></h4>

Tapasin and TAPBPR are known to perform peptide editing on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, however, the precise molecular mechanism(s) involved in this process remain largely enigmatic. Here, using immunopeptidomics in combination with novel cell-based assays that assess TAPBPR-mediate peptide exchange, we reveal a critical role for the K22-D35 loop of TAPBPR in mediating peptide exchange on MHC I. We identify a specific leucine within this loop that enables TAPBPR to facilitate peptide dissociation from MHC I. Moreover, we delineate the molecular features of the MHC I F pocket required for TAPBPR to promote peptide dissociation in a loop-dependent manner. These data reveal that chaperone-mediated peptide editing of MHC I can occur by different mechanisms dependent on the C-terminal residue that the MHC I accommodates in its F pocket and provide novel insights that may inform the therapeutic potential of TAPBPR manipulation to increase tumour immunogenicity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39658">Pericentromeric hypomethylation elicits an interferon response in an animal model of ICF syndrome</a></h4>

Pericentromeric satellite repeats are enriched in 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Loss of 5mC at these sequences is common in cancer and is a hallmark of Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome. While the general importance of 5mC is well-established, the specific functions of 5mC at pericentromeres are less clear. To address this deficiency, we generated a viable animal model of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of the ICF-gene <i>ZBTB24</i>. Deletion of zebrafish <i>zbtb24</i> caused a progressive loss of 5mC at pericentromeres and ICF-like phenotypes. Hypomethylation of these repeats triggered derepression of pericentromeric transcripts and activation of an interferon-based innate immune response. Injection of pericentromeric RNA is sufficient to elicit this response in wild-type embryos, and mutation of the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA-sensing machinery blocks the response in mutants. These findings identify activation of the innate immune system as an early consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation, implicating derepression of pericentromeric transcripts as a trigger of autoimmunity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38090">Rat behavior and dopamine release are modulated by conspecific distress</a></h4>

Rats exhibit ‘empathy’ making them a model to understand the neural underpinnings of such behavior. We show data consistent with these findings, but also that behavior and dopamine (DA) release reflects subjective rather than objective evaluation of appetitive and aversive events that occur to another. We recorded DA release in two paradigms: one that involved cues predictive of unavoidable shock to the conspecific and another that allowed the rat to refrain from reward when there were harmful consequences to the conspecific. Behavior and DA reflected pro-social interactions in that DA suppression was reduced during cues that predicted shock in the presence of the conspecific and that DA release observed on self-avoidance trials was present when the conspecific was spared. However, DA also increased when the conspecific was shocked instead of the recording rat and DA release during conspecific avoidance trials was lower than when the rat avoided shock for itself.

Markerless and accurate tracking of mouse movement is of interest to many biomedical, pharmaceutical, and behavioral science applications. The additional capability of tracking body parts in real-time with minimal latency opens up the possibility of manipulating motor feedback, allowing detailed explorations of the neural basis for behavioral control. Here we describe a system capable of tracking specific movements in mice at a frame rate of 30.3 Hz. To achieve these results, we adapt DeepLabCut - a robust movement-tracking deep neural network framework - for real-time tracking of body movements in mice. We estimate paw movements of mice in real time and demonstrate the concept of movement-triggered optogenetic stimulation by flashing a USB-CGPIO controlled LED that is triggered when real time analysis of movement exceeds a pre-set threshold. The mean time delay between movement initiation and LED flash was 93.44 ms, a latency sufficient for applying behaviorally-triggered feedback. This manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and shows implementation of the system using behaving mice. This system lays the groundwork for a behavior-triggered 'closed loop' brain-machine interface with optogenetic stimulation of specific brain regions for feedback.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/482190v1?rss=1">Neural sensitization improves encoding fidelity in the primate retina</a></h4>

Sensory neural circuits must create internal representations of the natural environment and update those representations when the environment changes. Many neurons perform these adjustments by adapting to the statistics of incoming stimuli, allowing these cells to then report when those statistics change. Other neural populations exhibit sensitization. Instead of aligning their input-output properties with stimulus statistics, the outputs of sensitizing cells closely track the variance of incoming stimuli. These forms of short-term plasticity are commonly thought to be opposing and complementary with adapting and sensitizing cells encoding strong and weak stimuli, respectively. We report that the numerically dominant output pathway in the macaque monkey retina, the midget (parvocellular-projecting) pathway, constitutes an exception to this rule. Midget cells strongly sensitize and lack a functional counterpart that displays adaptation. Instead of counterbalancing adapting cells, sensitization in midget cells supports accurate sensory encoding and prevents a loss of responsiveness during dynamic vision.

Precise neural sequences are associated with the production of well-learned skilled behaviors. Yet, how neural sequences arise in the brain remains unclear. In songbirds, premotor projection neurons in the cortical song nucleus HVC are necessary for producing learned song and exhibit precise sequential activity during singing. Using cell-type specific calcium imaging we identify populations of HVC premotor neurons associated with the beginning and ending of singing-related neural sequences. We discovered neurons that bookend singing-related sequences and neuronal populations that transition from sparse preparatory activity prior to song to precise neural sequences during singing. Recordings from downstream premotor neurons or the respiratory system suggest that pre-song activity may be involved in motor preparation to sing. These findings reveal population mechanisms associated with moving from non-vocal to vocal behavioral states and suggest that precise neural sequences begin and end as part of orchestrated activity across functionally diverse populations of cortical premotor neurons.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/481838v1?rss=1">Brain network dynamics during spontaneous strategy shifts and incremental task optimization</a></h4>

With practice, humans may improve their performance in a task by either optimizing a known strategy or discovering a novel, potentially more fruitful strategy. How does the brain support these two fundamental abilities? In the present experiment, subjects performed a simple perceptual decision-making task. They could either use and progressively optimize an instructed strategy based on stimulus position, or spontaneously devise and then use a new strategy based on stimulus color. We investigated how local and long-range BOLD coherence behave during these two types of strategy learning by applying a recently developed unsupervised fMRI analysis technique that was specifically designed to probe the presence of transient correlations. Converging evidence showed that the posterior portion of the default network, i.e. the precuneus and the angular gyrus bilaterally, has a central role in the optimization of the current strategy: these regions encoded the relevant spatial information, increased the level of local coherence and the strength of connectivity with other relevant regions in the brain (e.g. visual cortex, dorsal attention network). This increase was proportional to the task optimization achieved by subjects, as measured by the reduction of reaction times, and was transiently disrupted when subjects were forced to change strategy. By contrast, the anterior portion of the default network (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex) together with rostral portion of the fronto-parietal network showed an increase in local coherence and connectivity only in subjects that would at some point spontaneously choose the new strategy. Overall, our findings shed light on the dynamic interactions between regions related with attention and with cognitive control, underlying the balance between strategy exploration and exploitation. Results suggest that the default network, far from being "shut-down" during task performance, has a pivotal role in the background exploration and monitoring of potential alternative courses of action.

Here we created a transposon-based single plasmid system, that allows long-term conditional loss- and gain-of-function experiments across major CNS cell types. The system is widely applicable across species, allowing fast, flexible and cheap cell manipulation in previously non-transgenic species.

The traditional approach in neuroscience relies on encoding models where brain responses to different stimuli are related to the latter to establish reproducible dependencies. To reduce neuronal and experimental noise, brain signals are usually averaged across trials to detect reliable and coherent brain activity. However, neural representations of stimulus features can be spread over time, frequency, and space, motivating the use of alternative methods that relate stimulus features to brain responses. We propose a Coherence-based spectro-spatial filter method that reconstructs stimulus features from intracortical brain signals. The proposed method models trials of an experiment as realizations of a random process and extracts patterns that are common across brain signals and the presented stimuli. These patterns, originating from different recording sites, are then combined (spatial filtering) to form a final prediction. Our results from three different cognitive tasks (motor movements, speech perception and speech production), concur to show that the proposed method significantly improves the ability to predict stimulus features over traditional methods such as multilinear regression with distributed lags and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, analyses of the model parameters show anatomical discriminability for execution of different motor movements. This anatomical discriminability is also observed in the perception and production of different words. These features could be exploited in the design of neuroprosthesis, as well as for exploring normal brain functioning.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/481234v1?rss=1">Distinctions among electroconvulsion- and proconvulsant-induced seizure discharges and native motor patterns during flight and grooming: Quantitative spike pattern analysis in Drosophila flight muscles</a></h4>

In Drosophila, high-frequency electrical stimulation across the brain triggers a highly stereotypic repertoire of spasms known as electroconvulsive seizures (ECS). The distinctive ECS spiking discharges manifest across the nervous system and can be stably assessed throughout the seizure repertoire in the large indirect flight muscles (DLMs). ECS discharges in DLMs have been extensively used to monitor seizure activities, notably in stress ('bang')-sensitive mutants. However, the relationships between ECS-spike patterns and native motor programs, including flight and grooming, are not known and their similarities and distinctions remain to be characterized. We employed quantitative spike pattern analyses to reveal distinctions amongst ECS discharges, flight and grooming motor patterns in terms of: 1) overall firing frequency, 2) spike timing between contralateral fibers, and 3) short-term variability in spike interval regularity (CV2) and instantaneous firing frequency (ISI-1). We then examined DLM firing phenotypes in well-established mutants in excitatory cholinergic (Cha), inhibitory GABAergic (Rdl) and electrical (ShakB) synaptic transmission. The results provide an initial glimpse on the vulnerability of individual motor patterns to perturbations of respective synaptic transmission systems. We found marked alterations of ECS discharge spike patterns in terms of either seizure threshold, spike frequency or spiking regularity. In contrast, no gross alterations during grooming and only a minor reduction of firing frequency during Rdl mutant flight were observed, suggesting a role for GABAergic modulation of flight motor programs. Picrotoxin (PTX), a known pro-convulsant that inhibits GABAA receptors, induced DLM seizure patterns that displayed some features, e.g. left-right coordination and ISI-1 range, that could be found in flight or grooming, but distinct from ECS discharges. Our results indicate that these quantitative techniques may be employed to reveal overlooked relationships among aberrant motor patterns and native DLM motor programs in genetic and pharmacological analyses of underlying cellular and neural circuit function.

Nervous system development is instructed both by genetic programs and activity-dependent refinement of gene expression and connectivity. How these mechanisms are integrated remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the regulated release of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) during development of the C. elegans nervous system accomplishes such an integration. We find that the p38 MAP kinase PMK-3, which is required for the differentiation of chemosensory BAG neurons, functions by limiting expression of an autocrine ILP signal that represses a chemosensory-neuron fate. ILPs are released from BAGs in an activity-dependent manner during embryonic development, and regulate neurodifferentiation through a non-canonical insulin receptor signaling pathway. The differentiation of a specialized neuron-type is, therefore, coordinately regulated by a genetic program that controls ILP expression and by neural activity, which regulates ILP release. Autocrine signals of this kind may have general and conserved functions as integrators of deterministic genetic programs with activity-dependent mechanisms during neurodevelopment.

We describe a set of perivascular interneurons (PINs) originating a series of fibro-vesicular complexes (FVCs) throughout the gray matter of the adult rabbit and rat brain. PINs-FVCs are ubiquitous throughout the brain vasculature as defined in Golgi-impregnated specimens. Most PINs consist of small, aspiny cells with local or long (&gt; 1 millimeter) axons that split running with arterial blood vessels. Upon ramification, axons originate FVCs around the roots of the arising vascular branches. Distally, FVCs form paired axons that run parallel to the vessel wall until another ramification ensues and a new FVC is formed. This alternating pattern ceases when the capillary diameter narrows (i.e., &lt;8 um) and axons resolve. FVCs, as visualized by electron microscopy, consist of clusters of anastomotic perivascular bulbs (PVBs) arising from the PINs unmyelinated axon. PVBs lie alongside the pre- or -capillary wall, surrounded by end-feet and the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells and pericytes. A PVB contains mitochondria, multivesicular bodies, and granules with a membranous core similar to those observed in Meissner corpuscles and other mechanoreceptors. Some PVBs form asymmetrical, axo-spinous synapses with presumptive adjacent neurons. Antisera to sensory fiber-terminals co-label putative FVCs that are embedded by astrocytic end-feet. Because of the strategic location, ubiquity, and cytological organization of the PIN-FVC, it is suggested that: 1. PIN-FVCs are distributed throughout the mammalian brain vasculature. 2. The PIN-FVC is a putative sensory receptor intrinsic of the neurovascular unit. 3. The PIN-FVC may correspond to an afferent limb of the sensory-motor feed-back controlling local blood flow.

Models of large-scale brain networks that are informed by the underlying anatomical connectivity contribute to our understanding of the mapping between the structure of the brain and its dynamical function. Connectome-based modelling is a promising approach to a more comprehensive understanding of brain function across spatial and temporal scales, but it must be constrained by multi-scale empirical data from animal models. Here we describe the construction of a macaque connectome for whole-cortex simulations in TheVirtualBrain, an open-source simulation platform. We take advantage of available axonal tract-tracing datasets and enhance the existing connectome data using diffusion-based tractography in macaques. We illustrate the utility of the connectome as an extension of TheVirtualBrain by simulating resting-state BOLD-fMRI data and fitting it to empirical resting-state data.

The prediction of upcoming movements is based on several types of neural signals that we normally experience on a daily basis and span the visual, somatosensory, motor and cognitive system. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to test whether the neural signals evoked by visual, memory-based and somato-motor information can be reliably used to predict upcoming actions in areas of the dorsal and ventral visual stream during the preparatory phase preceding the action, while participants were lying still. Nineteen human participants (nine women) performed one of two actions towards an object with their eyes open or closed. Despite the well-known role of ventral stream areas in visual recognition tasks and the specialization of dorsal stream areas in somato-motor processes, we decoded action intention in areas of both streams based on visual, memory-based and somato-motor signals. Interestingly, we could reliably decode action intention in absence of visual information based on neural activity evoked when visual information was available, and vice-versa. Our results show a similar visual, memory and somato-motor representation of action planning in dorsal and ventral visual stream areas that allows predicting action intention across domains, regardless of the availability of visual information.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/479881v1?rss=1">Modelling conduction delays in the corpus callosum using MRI-measured g-ratio</a></h4>

Conduction of action potentials along myelinated axons is affected by its structural features, such as the axonal g-ratio. The g-ratio is the ratio between the inner and outer diameters of the myelin sheath surrounding the axon. The effect of g-ratio variance on conduction properties has been quantitatively evaluated using single-axon models. It has recently become possible to estimate a g-ratio weighted measurement using quantitative MRI. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether the variance in the g-ratio in the healthy human brain leads to significant differences in conduction velocity. In this work we tested whether the g-ratio MRI measurement can be used to predict conduction delays in the corpus callosum. We present a novel framework in which the structural properties of fibers (i.e. length and g-ratio, measured with MRI), are incorporated in a biophysical model of axon conduction, to predict conduction delays of long-range white matter fibers. We applied this framework to the corpus callosum, and found conduction delay estimates that are compatible with values generated more directly (~15 ms). Furthermore, since studies that use response time and electrophysiology suggest an increase in conduction delays with age, we compared younger and older subjects. We investigated whether there are differences in the g-ratio and the fiber length between the age groups, and whether they lead to a difference in conduction delays. We found no significant differences between the predicted delays of the two groups. Our study provides a framework for predicting conduction latencies in vivo. The framework could have major implications for future studies of white matter diseases and large range network computations. Our results highlight the need for improving additional in vivo measurements of white matter microstructure.

Background: It is increasingly recognized that the complex functions of human cognition are not accurately represented by arbitrarily-defined anatomical brain regions. Given the considerable functional specialization within such regions, more fine-grained studies of brain structure could capture such localized associations. However, such analyses/studies in a large community-dwelling population are lacking. Methods: In 3,813 stroke-free and non-demented persons from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69.1 (8.8) years; 55.8% women) with cognitive assessments and brain MRI, we performed voxel-based morphometry and subcortical shape analysis on global cognition and separate tests that tapped into memory, information processing speed, fine motor speed, and executive function domains. Results: We found that the different cognitive tests significantly associated with grey matter voxels in differential but also overlapping brain regions, primarily in the left hemisphere. Clusters of significantly associated voxels with global cognition were located within multiple anatomic regions: left amygdala, hippocampus, parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus, insula and posterior temporal lobe. Subcortical shape analysis revealed associations primarily within the head and tail of the caudate nucleus, putamen, ventral part of the thalamus, and nucleus accumbens, more equally distributed among the left and right hemisphere. Within the caudate nucleus both positive (head) as well as negative (tail) associations were observed with global cognition. Conclusions: In a large population-based sample, we mapped cognitive performance to (sub)cortical grey matter using a hypothesis-free approach with high-dimensional neuroimaging. Leveraging the power of our large sample size, we confirmed well-known associations as well as identified novel brain regions related to cognition.

Decision making is an essential part of daily life, in which balancing reasons and calculating risks to reach a certain confidence are important to make reasonable choices. To investigate the EEG correlates of confidence during decision making a study involving a forced choice recognition memory task was implemented. Subjects were asked to distinguish old from new pictures and rate their decision with either high or low confidence. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis was performed in four different phases covering all stages of decision making, including the information encoding, retrieval, decision formation, and feedback processing during the recognition task. Additionally, a single trial support-vector machine (SVM) classification was performed on the ERPs of each phase to get a measure of differentiability of the two levels of confidence on a single subject level. It could be shown that the level of decision confidence is significantly reflected in all stages of decision making but most prominently during feedback presentation. The main differences between high and low confidence can be found in the ERPs during feedback presentation after a correct answer, whereas almost no differences can be found in ERPs from feedback to wrong answers. In the feedback phase the two levels of confidence can be separated with a classification accuracy of up to 70 % on average over all subjects, therefore showing potential as a control state in a brain-computer Interface (BCI) application.

It is usually assumed that sensory adaptation is a universal property of human vision. However, in two experiments designed to measure adaptation without bias, we have discovered a minority of participants who were unusual in the extent of their adaptation to motion. One experiment was designed so that targets would be invisible without adaptation; the other, so that adaptation would interfere with target detection. In the first, participants adapted to a spatial array of moving Gabor patches. On each trial the adapting array was followed by a test array in which but all of the test patches except one were identical to their spatially corresponding adaptors; the target moved in the opposite direction to its adaptor. Participants were required to identify the location of the changed target with a mouse click. The ability to do so increased with the number of adapting trials. Neither search speed nor accuracy was affected by an attentionally-demanding conjunction task at the fixation point during adaptation, suggesting low-level (pre-attentive) sites in the visual pathway for the adaptation. However, a minority of participants found the task virtually impossible. In the second experiment the same participants were required to identify the one element in the test array that was slowly moving: reaction times in this case were elevated following adaptation. The putatively weak adapters from the first experiment found this task easier than the strong adapters.

Crossmodal correspondences refer to associations between apparently unrelated stimulus features in different sensory modalities. Sound symbolism, a special class of crossmodal correspondence between the sounds of words and their meanings, has been studied by matching auditory pseudowords, e.g. 'takete' or 'maluma', with pointed or rounded visual shapes, respectively. We report here on a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which participants were presented with audiovisual pseudoword-shape pairs that were sound symbolically congruent or incongruent. In whole-brain analyses, there were no significant neural congruency effects during attention to visual shapes, but when participants attended to the auditory pseudowords, we observed greater activity for incongruent compared to congruent (I &gt; C) audiovisual pairs bilaterally in the intraparietal sulcus and neighboring supramarginal gyrus, and in the left middle frontal gyrus. Comparing these activations to independent functional localizers and additional region-of-interest analyses revealed no evidence for semantic mediation, and limited evidence for processes relating to multisensory integration and magnitude estimation as possible underlying mechanisms. Stronger support was found for a relationship to phonological processing and/or multisensory attention. Further, when attending to auditory pseudowords, incongruency (I &gt; C) activation magnitudes in visual cortical foci and the precuneus were positively correlated, across participants, with preferences for visual object imagery, suggesting potential neural substrates for individual differences in sound symbolism. These findings are important for understanding a central question in neurolinguistics: the nature of sound-to-meaning mapping in the brain.

<p>by Lina Meinecke, Praveer P. Sharma, Huijing Du, Lei Zhang, Qing Nie, Thomas F. Schilling</p>

How does pattern formation occur accurately when confronted with tissue growth and stochastic fluctuations (noise) in gene expression? Dorso-ventral (D-V) patterning of the mandibular arch specifies upper versus lower jaw skeletal elements through a combination of Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), Endothelin-1 (Edn1), and Notch signaling, and this system is highly robust. We combine NanoString experiments of early D-V gene expression with live imaging of arch development in zebrafish to construct a computational model of the D-V mandibular patterning network. The model recapitulates published genetic perturbations in arch development. Patterning is most sensitive to changes in Bmp signaling, and the temporal order of gene expression modulates the response of the patterning network to noise. Thus, our integrated systems biology approach reveals non-intuitive features of the complex signaling system crucial for craniofacial development, including novel insights into roles of gene expression timing and stochasticity in signaling and gene regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nw45cvIUcgA" width="1" />

<p>by Oliver M. Crook, Claire M. Mulvey, Paul D. W. Kirk, Kathryn S. Lilley, Laurent Gatto</p>

Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xZZza2iv30E" width="1" />

<p>by Jun Li, Wei Zhu, Jun Wang, Wenfei Li, Sheng Gong, Jian Zhang, Wei Wang</p>

Quality assessment is essential for the computational prediction and design of RNA tertiary structures. To date, several knowledge-based statistical potentials have been proposed and proved to be effective in identifying native and near-native RNA structures. All these potentials are based on the inverse Boltzmann formula, while differing in the choice of the geometrical descriptor, reference state, and training dataset. Via an approach that diverges completely from the conventional statistical potentials, our work explored the power of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach as a quality evaluator for RNA 3D structures, which used a 3D grid representation of the structure as input without extracting features manually. The RNA structures were evaluated by examining each nucleotide, so our method can also provide local quality assessment. Two sets of training samples were built. The first one included 1 million samples generated by high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the second one included 1 million samples generated by Monte Carlo (MC) structure prediction. Both MD and MC procedures were performed for a non-redundant set of 414 RNAs. For two training datasets (one including only MD training samples and the other including both MD and MC training samples), we trained two neural networks, named RNA3DCNN_MD and RNA3DCNN_MDMC, respectively. The former is suitable for assessing near-native structures, while the latter is suitable for assessing structures covering large structural space. We tested the performance of our method and made comparisons with four other traditional scoring functions. On two of three test datasets, our method performed similarly to the state-of-the-art traditional scoring function, and on the third test dataset, our method was far superior to other scoring functions. Our method can be downloaded from https://github.com/lijunRNA/RNA3DCNN.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JE7z7RP6F5Y" width="1" />

On the other hand, we found that Mdm2 is a modifier of chromatin, modulating polycomb repressor complex (PRC)-driven histone modifications. Here we show that,...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/h0yFdkhW4O0" width="1" />

Anthozoa-class red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are frequently used as biological markers, with far-red (λem ∼ 600–700 nm) emitting variants sought for whole-animal imaging because biological tissues are more permeable to light in this range.

Proteins that fold cotranslationally may do so in a restricted configurational space, due to the volume occupied by the ribosome.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10431">Two Cognitive Transitions Underlying the Capacity for Cultural Evolution. (arXiv:1811.10431v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>This paper proposes that the distinctively human capacity for cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

<p>We present the first real-time sleep staging system that uses deep learning
without the need for servers in a smartphone application for a wearable EEG. We
employ real-time adaptation of a single channel Electroencephalography (EEG) to
infer from a Time-Distributed 1-D Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
Polysomnography (PSG)-the gold standard for sleep staging, requires a human
scorer and is both complex and resource-intensive. Our work demonstrates an
end-to-end on-smartphone pipeline that can infer sleep stages in just single
30-second epochs, with an overall accuracy of 83.5% on 20-fold cross validation
for five-class classification of sleep stages using the open Sleep-EDF dataset.

<p>Cortical neurons whose activity is recorded in behavioral experiments has
been classified into several types such as stimulus-related neurons,
delay-period neurons, and reward-related neurons. Moreover, the population
activity of neurons during a reaching task can be described by dynamics in
low-dimensional space. These results suggest that the low-dimensional dynamics
of a few types of neurons emerge in the cerebral cortex that is trained to
perform a task. This study investigates a simple neural circuit emerges with a
few types of neurons. Assuming an infinite number of neurons in the circuit
with connection weights drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we model the
dynamics of neurons by using a kernel function. Given that the system is
infinitely large, almost all capable circuits approximate the most probable
circuit for the task. We simulate two delayed response tasks and a
motor-pattern generation task. The model network exhibits low-dimensional
dynamics in all tasks. Considering that the connection weights are drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, the most probable circuit is the circuit with the
smallest connection weight; that is, the simplest circuit with the simplest
dynamics. Finally, we relate the dynamics to algorithmic information theory.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09739">A probabilistic population code based on neural samples. (arXiv:1811.09739v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Sensory processing is often characterized as implementing probabilistic
inference: networks of neurons compute posterior beliefs over unobserved causes
given the sensory inputs. How these beliefs are computed and represented by
neural responses is much-debated (Fiser et al. 2010, Pouget et al. 2013). A
central debate concerns the question of whether neural responses represent
samples of latent variables (Hoyer &amp; Hyvarinnen 2003) or parameters of their
distributions (Ma et al. 2006) with efforts being made to distinguish between
them (Grabska-Barwinska et al. 2013). A separate debate addresses the question
of whether neural responses are proportionally related to the encoded
probabilities (Barlow 1969), or proportional to the logarithm of those
probabilities (Jazayeri &amp; Movshon 2006, Ma et al. 2006, Beck et al. 2012).
Here, we show that these alternatives - contrary to common assumptions - are
not mutually exclusive and that the very same system can be compatible with all
of them. As a central analytical result, we show that modeling neural responses
in area V1 as samples from a posterior distribution over latents in a linear
Gaussian model of the image implies that those neural responses form a linear
Probabilistic Population Code (PPC, Ma et al. 2006). In particular, the
posterior distribution over some experimenter-defined variable like
"orientation" is part of the exponential family with sufficient statistics that
are linear in the neural sampling-based firing rates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41968">Piezo's membrane footprint and its contribution to mechanosensitivity</a></h4>

Piezo1 is an ion channel that gates open when mechanical force is applied to a cell membrane, thus allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical stimulation. Molecular structures of Piezo1 reveal a large ion channel with an unusually curved shape. This study analyzes how such a curved ion channel interacts energetically with the cell membrane. Through membrane mechanical calculations, we show that Piezo1 deforms the membrane shape outside the perimeter of the channel into a curved 'membrane footprint'. This membrane footprint amplifies the sensitivity of Piezo1 to changes in membrane tension, rendering it exquisitely responsive. We assert that the shape of the Piezo channel is an elegant example of molecular form evolved to optimize a specific function, in this case tension sensitivity. Furthermore, the predicted influence of the membrane footprint on Piezo gating is consistent with the demonstrated importance of membrane-cytoskeletal attachments to Piezo gating.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41604">Molecular basis for activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase by a compound that increases HDL cholesterol</a></h4>

Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and LCAT-activating compounds are being investigated as treatments for coronary heart disease (CHD) and familial LCAT deficiency (FLD). Herein we report the crystal structure of human LCAT in complex with a potent piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator and an acyl intermediate-like inhibitor, revealing LCAT in an active conformation. Unlike other LCAT activators, the piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator binds exclusively to the membrane-binding domain (MBD). Functional studies indicate that the compound does not modulate the affinity of LCAT for HDL, but instead stabilizes residues in the MBD and facilitates channeling of substrates into the active site. By demonstrating that these activators increase the activity of an FLD variant, we show that compounds targeting the MBD have therapeutic potential. Our data better define the substrate binding site of LCAT and pave the way for rational design of LCAT agonists and improved biotherapeutics for augmenting or restoring reverse cholesterol transport in CHD and FLD patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41319">Managing a sustainable deep-sea ‘blue economy’ requires knowledge of what actually lives there</a></h4>

Ensuring that the wealth of resources contained in our oceans are managed and developed in a sustainable manner is a priority for the emerging 'blue economy'. However, modern ecosystem-based management approaches do not translate well to regions where we know almost nothing about the individual species found in the ecosystem. Here, we propose a new taxon-focused approach to deep-sea conservation that includes regulatory oversight to set targets for the delivery of taxonomic data. For example, a five-year plan to deliver taxonomic and genomic knowledge on a thousand species in regions of the ocean earmarked for industrial activity is an achievable target. High-throughput, integrative taxonomy can, therefore, provide the data that is needed to monitor various ecosystem services (such as the natural history, connectivity, value and function of species) and to help break the regulatory deadlock of high-seas conservation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40841">Natural variation in sugar tolerance associates with changes in signaling and mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis</a></h4>

How dietary selection impacts genome evolution to define the optimal range of nutrient intake is a poorly understood question with medical relevance. We have addressed this question by analyzing <i>Drosophila simulans</i> and <i>sechellia</i>, recently diverged species with differential diet choice. <i>D. sechellia</i> larvae, specialized to a nutrient scarce diet, did not survive on sugar rich conditions, while the generalist species <i>D. simulans</i> was sugar tolerant. Sugar tolerance in <i>D. simulans</i> was a tradeoff for performance on low energy diet and was associated with global reprogramming of metabolic gene expression. Hybridization and phenotype-based introgression revealed the genomic regions of <i>D. simulans</i> that were sufficient for sugar tolerance. These regions included genes that are involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and intracellular signaling, such as <i>PPP1R15</i>/<i>Gadd34 </i>and <i>SERCA</i>, which contributed to sugar tolerance. In conclusion, genomic variation affecting genes involved in global metabolic control defines the optimal range for dietary macronutrient composition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40314">Translation attenuation by minocycline enhances longevity and proteostasis in old post-stress-responsive organisms</a></h4>

Aging impairs the activation of stress signaling pathways (SSPs), preventing the induction of longevity mechanisms late in life. Here, we show that the antibiotic minocycline increases lifespan and reduces protein aggregation even in old, SSP-deficient <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> by targeting cytoplasmic ribosomes, preferentially attenuating translation of highly translated mRNAs. In contrast to most other longevity paradigms, minocycline inhibits rather than activates all major SSPs and extends lifespan in mutants deficient in the activation of SSPs, lysosomal or autophagic pathways. We propose that minocycline lowers the concentration of newly synthesized aggregation-prone proteins, resulting in a relative increase in protein-folding capacity without the necessity to induce protein-folding pathways. Our study suggests that in old individuals with incapacitated SSPs or autophagic pathways, pharmacological attenuation of cytoplasmic translation is a promising strategy to reduce protein aggregation. Altogether, it provides a geroprotecive mechanism for the many beneficial effects of tetracyclines in models of neurodegenerative disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39720">Selective agonist of TRPML2 reveals direct role in chemokine release from innate immune cells</a></h4>

Cytokines and chemokines are produced and secreted by a broad range of immune cells including macrophages. Remarkably, little is known about how these inflammatory mediators are released from the various immune cells. Here, the endolysosomal cation channel TRPML2 is shown to play a direct role in chemokine trafficking and secretion from murine macrophages. To demonstrate acute and direct involvement of TRPML2 in these processes, the first isoform-selective TRPML2 channel agonist was generated, ML2-SA1. ML2-SA1 was not only found to directly stimulate release of the chemokine CCL2 from macrophages but also to stimulate macrophage migration, thus mimicking CCL2 function. Endogenous TRPML2 is expressed in early/recycling endosomes as demonstrated by endolysosomal patch-clamp experimentation and ML2-SA1 promotes trafficking through early/recycling endosomes, suggesting CCL2 being transported and secreted via this pathway. These data provide a direct link between TRPML2 activation, CCL2 release and stimulation of macrophage migration in the innate immune response.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38407">Theoretical tool bridging cell polarities with development of robust morphologies</a></h4>

Despite continual renewal and damages, a multicellular organism is able to maintain its complex morphology. How is this stability compatible with the complexity and diversity of living forms? Looking for answers at protein level may be limiting as diverging protein sequences can result in similar morphologies. Inspired by the progressive role of apical-basal and planar cell polarity in development, we propose that stability, complexity, and diversity are emergent properties in populations of proliferating polarized cells. We support our hypothesis by a theoretical approach, developed to effectively capture both types of polar cell adhesions. When applied to specific cases of development – gastrulation and the origins of folds and tubes – our theoretical tool suggests experimentally testable predictions pointing to the strength of polar adhesion, restricted directions of cell polarities, and the rate of cell proliferation to be major determinants of morphological diversity and stability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38393">Spatiotemporally controlled genetic perturbation for efficient large-scale studies of cell non-autonomous effects</a></h4>

Studies in genetic model organisms have revealed much about the development and pathology of complex tissues. Most have focused on cell-intrinsic gene functions and mechanisms. Much less is known about how transformed, or otherwise functionally disrupted, cells interact with healthy ones towards a favorable or pathological outcome. This is largely due to technical limitations. We developed new genetic tools in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that permit efficient multiplexed gain- and loss-of-function genetic perturbations with separable spatial and temporal control. Importantly, our novel tool-set is independent of the commonly used GAL4/UAS system, freeing the latter for additional, non-autonomous, genetic manipulations; and is built into a single strain, allowing one-generation interrogation of non-autonomous effects. Altogether, our design opens up efficient genome-wide screens on any deleterious phenotype, once plasmid or genome engineering is used to place the desired miRNA(s) or ORF(s) into our genotype. Specifically, we developed tools to study extrinsic effects on neural tumor growth but the strategy presented has endless applications within and beyond neurobiology, and in other model organisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37841">Augmented reality powers a cognitive assistant for the blind</a></h4>

To restore vision for the blind, several prosthetic approaches have been explored that convey raw images to the brain. So far, these schemes all suffer from a lack of bandwidth. An alternate approach would restore vision at the cognitive level, bypassing the need to convey sensory data. A wearable computer captures video and other data, extracts important scene knowledge, and conveys that to the user in compact form. Here, we implement an intuitive user interface for such a device using augmented reality: each object in the environment has a voice and communicates with the user on command. With minimal training, this system supports many aspects of visual cognition: obstacle avoidance, scene understanding, formation and recall of spatial memories, navigation. Blind subjects can traverse an unfamiliar multi-story building on their first attempt. To spur further development in this domain, we developed an open-source environment for standardized benchmarking of visual assistive devices.

Research has shown that oxytocin (OT) injection to periaqueductal gray (PAG) eases pain. We hypothesized that OT in PAG may eventually suppress the activity of pain perception neurons inside the spinal cord (SC), then block further aversion signals to the brain. Here, we confirmed that PAG receives OT-ergic axons from the paraventricular nucleus in rats. In PAG, optogenetically triggered axonal OT release evoked excitation in some neurons, and inhibition in others. Of these OT-excited neurons, active neurons alternated between one and the other as time passed, but the number of active neurons at each moment was continuously maintained at the same level at least for 300 s after laser beam stimulation. Further, OT release in PAG reduced pain-induced activity of SC neurons, whose effect reached maximum levels at approximately 220 s after the laser beam stimulation. Interestingly, in rats presented with pain but where OT release was not evoked, a similar time course of SC activity reduction was observed, but the magnitude of reduction was minor. Lastly, OT release in PAG raised the threshold of mechanical pain but not heat pain in inflammation model animals.

Background: Measuring the brain's response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) offers a unique insight into the local cortical circuits and networks activated following stimulation, particularly in non-motor regions where less is known about TMS physiology. However, the mechanisms underlying TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) remain largely unknown. Objective: We assessed TEP reliability, site-specificity, and sensitivity to changes in excitatory neurotransmission mediated by n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors following stimulation of non-motor regions. Methods: In fourteen male volunteers, resting EEG and TEPs from prefrontal (PFC) and parietal (PAR) cortex were measured before and after administration of either dextromethorphan (an NMDA receptor antagonist) or placebo across two sessions separated by at least a week in a double-blinded pseudo-randomised crossover design. Results: At baseline, TEPs showed lower within- than between-subject variability for both stimulation sites across sessions, demonstrating the reliability of non-motor TEPs within individuals. There were differences in amplitude between PFC and PAR TEPs across a wide time range (15-250 ms), however the signals were correlated after ~80 ms, suggesting that early peaks reflect site-specific activity, whereas later peaks reflect global activity patterns independent of stimulation site. TEPs were not altered following dextromethorphan compared to placebo, however low frequency resting oscillations were reduced in power. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that TEPs from PFC and PAR: 1) are reliable within and variable between individuals; 2) reflect stimulation site specific activity across early (&lt;80 ms), but not late time points; and 3) are not sensitive to changes in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cortical dysfunction and can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy. Multiple studies demonstrate that GABAergic inhibitory network function is compromised following TBI, which may contribute to hyperexcitability and motor, behavioral, and cognitive deficits. Preserving the function of GABAergic interneurons, therefore, is a rational therapeutic strategy to preserve cortical function after TBI and prevent long-term clinical complications. Here, we explored an approach based on the ketogenic diet, a neuroprotective and anticonvulsant dietary therapy which results in reduced glycolysis and increased ketosis. Utilizing a pharmacologic inhibitor of glycolysis (2-deoxyglucose, or 2-DG), we found that acute in vitro glycolytic inhibition decreased the excitability of excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory interneurons, in cortical slices from naive mice. Employing the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in mice, we found that in vitro 2-DG treatment rapidly attenuated epileptiform activity seen in acute cortical slices 3-5 weeks after TBI. One week of in vivo 2-DG treatment immediately after TBI prevented the development of epileptiform activity, restored excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity, and attenuated loss of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons. In summary, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG may have therapeutic potential to restore network function following TBI.

In rodents, poorly formed hippocampal memories can be improved by novelty exploration within a critical time window, in line with the behavioral tagging hypothesis. Here, we sought to establish an analogue protocol to investigate if novelty exploration similarly operates to rescue weak hippocampal-dependent memories in humans. Adult humans underwent suboptimal contextual fear conditioning, followed 10 minutes later by open field novelty exploration in immersive 3D virtual reality. Novelty exploration did not improve long-term contextual fear memory, contrary to a behavioral tagging hypothesis. Despite this null result, we suggest further attempts to translate behavioral tagging from rodents to humans is warranted.

<p>by Letícia Stock, Juliana Hosoume, Leonardo Cirqueira, Werner Treptow</p>

The direct-site hypothesis assumes general anesthetics bind ion channels to impact protein equilibrium and function, inducing anesthesia. Despite advancements in the field, a first principle all-atom demonstration of this structure-function premise is still missing. We focus on the clinically used sevoflurane interaction to anesthetic-sensitive Kv1.2 mammalian channel to resolve if sevoflurane binds protein’s well-characterized open and closed structures in a conformation-dependent manner to shift channel equilibrium. We employ an innovative approach relying on extensive docking calculations and free-energy perturbation of all potential binding sites revealed by the latter, and find sevoflurane binds open and closed structures at multiple sites under complex saturation and concentration effects. Results point to a non-trivial interplay of site and conformation-dependent modes of action involving distinct binding sites that increase channel open-probability at diluted ligand concentrations. Given the challenge in exploring more complex processes potentially impacting channel-anesthetic interaction, the result is revealing as it demonstrates the process of multiple anesthetic binding events alone may account for open-probability shifts recorded in measurements.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R7l5I-sNaNM" width="1" />

<p>by Sarah F. Beul, Alexandros Goulas, Claus C. Hilgetag</p>

The architectonic type principle relates patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions. One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our <i>in silico</i> model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YGzOoH1dEQs" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaodong Huang, Zhen Song, Zhilin Qu</p>

Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are spontaneous depolarizations during the repolarization phase of an action potential in cardiac myocytes. It is widely known that EADs are promoted by increasing inward currents and/or decreasing outward currents, a condition called reduced repolarization reserve. Recent studies based on bifurcation theories show that EADs are caused by a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation, bringing in further mechanistic insights into the genesis and dynamics of EADs. In this study, we investigated the EAD properties, such as the EAD amplitude, the inter-EAD interval, and the latency of the first EAD, and their major determinants. We first made predictions based on the bifurcation theory and then validated them in physiologically more detailed action potential models. These properties were investigated by varying one parameter at a time or using parameter sets randomly drawn from assigned intervals. The theoretical and simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Our major findings are that the EAD amplitude and takeoff potential exhibit a negative linear correlation; the inter-EAD interval is insensitive to the maximum ionic current conductance but mainly determined by the kinetics of I<sub>Ca,L</sub> and the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation; and both inter-EAD interval and latency vary largely from model to model. Most of the model results generally agree with experimental observations in isolated ventricular myocytes. However, a major discrepancy between modeling results and experimental observations is that the inter-EAD intervals observed in experiments are mainly between 200 and 500 ms, irrespective of species, while those of the mathematical models exhibit a much wider range with some models exhibiting inter-EAD intervals less than 100 ms. Our simulations show that the cause of this discrepancy is likely due to the difference in I<sub>Ca,L</sub> recovery properties in different mathematical models, which needs to be addressed in future action potential model development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vXy6RgqS0DE" width="1" />

Abstract<p>A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception <i>in vivo</i> by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.</p>

Abstract<p>The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.</p>

Abstract<p>Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and "fine-tuned" subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic "liking" associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0008-18.2018v1?rss=1">Hierarchical Cognition causes Task Related Deactivations but not just in Default Mode Regions</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by <i>any</i> region not <i>currently</i> involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.</p>

<p>The ideas that we forge creatively as individuals and groups build on one
another in a manner that is cumulative and adaptive, forming open-ended
lineages across space and time. Thus, human culture is believed to evolve. The
pervasiveness of cross-domain creativity--as when a song inspires a
painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social
group level.

<p>The aim of the paper is to address the behavior in large population of
diffusions interacting on a random, possibly diluted and inhomogeneous graph.
This is the natural continuation of a previous work, where the homogeneous
Erd\H os-R\'enyi case was considered. The class of graphs we consider includes
disordered $W$-random graphs, with possibly unbounded graphons. The main result
concerns a quenched convergence (that is true for almost every realization of
the random graph) of the empirical measure of the system towards the solution
of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck PDE with spatial extension, also appearing in
different contexts, especially in neuroscience. The convergence of the spatial
profile associated to the diffusions is also considered, and one proves that
the limit is described in terms of a nonlinear integro-differential equation
which matches the neural field equation in certain particular cases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43326">Endocytosis at the <i>Drosophila</i> blood–brain barrier as a function for sleep</a></h4>

Glia are important modulators of neural activity, yet few studies link glia to sleep regulation. We find that blocking activity of the endocytosis protein, dynamin, in adult <i>Drosophila</i> glia increases sleep and enhances sleep need, manifest as resistance to sleep deprivation. Surface glia comprising the fly equivalent of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediate the effect of dynamin on sleep. Blocking dynamin in the surface glia causes ultrastructural changes, albeit without compromising the integrity of the barrier. Supporting a role for endocytic trafficking in sleep, a screen of Rab GTPases identifies sleep-modulating effects of the recycling endosome Rab11 in surface glia. We also find that endocytosis is increased in BBB glia during sleep and reflects sleep need. We propose that endocytic trafficking through the BBB represents a function of sleep.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40325">Splicing factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct roles in mitotic chromosome segregation</a></h4>

Several studies have shown that RNAi-mediated depletion of splicing factors (SFs) results in mitotic abnormalities. However, it is currently unclear whether these abnormalities reflect defective splicing of specific pre-mRNAs or a direct role of the SFs in mitosis. Here we show that two highly conserved SFs, Sf3A2 and Prp31, are required for chromosome segregation in both <i>Drosophila</i> and human cells. Injections of anti-Sf3A2 and anti-Prp31 antibodies into <i>Drosophila</i> embryos disrupt mitotic division within 1 minute, arguing strongly against a splicing-related mitotic function of these factors. We demonstrate that both SFs bind spindle microtubules (MTs) and the Ndc80 complex, which in Sf3A2- and Prp31-depleted cells is not tightly associated with the kinetochores; in HeLa cells the Ndc80/HEC1-SF interaction is restricted to the M phase. These results indicate that Sf3A2 and Prp31 directly regulate interactions among kinetochores, spindle microtubules and the Ndc80 complex in both <i>Drosophila </i>and human cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.</p>

<p>Predictive modelling of functional connectomes from structural connectomes
explores commonalities across multimodal imaging data. However, direct
application of multivariate approaches such as sparse Canonical Correlation
Analysis (sCCA) applies on the vectorised elements of functional connectivity
across subjects and it does not guarantee that the predicted models of
functional connectivity are Symmetric Positive Matrices (SPD). We suggest an
elegant solution based on the transportation of the connectivity matrices on a
Riemannian manifold, which notably improves the prediction performance of the
model. Subsequently, we construct a statistical framework to highlight brain
connections that are selected with probability well above chance and we
estimate their sCCA loadings based on a de-noising approach.

<p>An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement. Where we
localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or
proprioception, but often only predicted sensory consequences based on
efference copies of motor commands are considered. Both signals should
contribute, so here we use passive training with rotated visual feedback of
hand position to prevent updates of predicted sensory consequences, but still
recalibrate proprioception. After this training we measure participants' hand
location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent
proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements as well as based on
proprioception only with robot-generated movements. The changes in hand
localization are equally large after training with robot- and self-generated
hand movements. Both motor and proprioceptive changes are only slightly smaller
as those after training with self-generated movements, confirming that
recalibrated proprioception contributes to motor learning.

<p>The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly
increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex
cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be
important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values
of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose
relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on
the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter
values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest
(QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual
parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output
uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said
parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size
and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension
reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The
methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of
neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity
analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of
$K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the
perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the
smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter,
for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological
dysfunction and areas of further investigation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08465">Fading of collective attention shapes the evolution of linguistic variants. (arXiv:1811.08465v1 [cs.CL])</a></h4>

<p>Language change involves the competition between alternative linguistic forms
(1). Notably, the Spanish past subjunctive comes in two perfectly equivalent
variants ended in -ra or -se (2); for instance, in the sentence 'If I were
there', the verb can be equally translated to estuviera or estuviese. During a
first spontaneous process that began in the Middle Ages, the form -ra migrated
from the indicative to the subjunctive, displacing the original -se form (3-5).
A second period started with the creation of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1713,
which produced a global standardization process that enforced the official
spelling of -ra and -se as perfectly interchangeable variants (6). Time series
extracted from a massive corpus of books (7) show that this standardization
produced a boost in the declining old form -se that eventually faded, leaving
-ra as the dominant one in the present time. The time series were successfully
fitted by a low dimensional model that integrates two basic collective
behaviors: an imitative component, and a fading of collective attention to the
institutional regulation. We show that the natural scale over which collective
attention fades is inversely proportional to the frequency of use of the verbs.

<p>Cortical oscillations, electrophysiological activity patterns, associated
with cognitive functions and impaired in many psychiatric disorders can be
observed in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Direct cortical
stimulation (DCS) may directly target these oscillations and may serve as
therapeutic approaches to restore functional impairments. However, the presence
of electrical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological data limits the
analysis of the effects of stimulation. Currently available methods suffer in
performance in the presence of nonstationarity inherent in biological data. Our
algorithm, Shape Adaptive Nonlocal Artifact Removal (SANAR) is based on
unsupervised manifold learning. By estimating the Euclidean median of k nearest
neighbors of each artifact in a nonlocal fashion, we obtain a faithful
representation of the artifact which is then subtracted. This approach
overcomes the challenges presented by nonstationarity. SANAR is effective in
removing stimulation artifacts in the time domain while preserving the spectral
content of the endogenous neurophysiological signal. We demonstrate the
performance in a simulated dataset as well as in human iEEG data. Using two
quantitative measures, that capture how much of information from endogenous
activity is retained, we demonstrate that SANAR's performance exceeds that of
one of the widely used approaches, independent component analysis, in the time
domain as well as the frequency domain. This approach allows for the analysis
of iEEG data, single channel or multiple channels, during DCS, a crucial step
in advancing our understanding of the effects of periodic stimulation and
developing new therapies.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D<sub>2</sub>R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region. D<sub>2</sub>R availability—here reliably quantified only in striatum—was not associated with either arousal or valence. These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.</span>

<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.</p>

Abstract<p>World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.</p>

<p>Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.</p>

<p>Synaptic AMPAR expression controls the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. An excess of synaptic AMPARs leads to epilepsy in response to seizure-inducible stimulation. The appropriate regulation of AMPARs plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying epilepsy remain unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that a key modification of AMPAR trafficking to and from postsynaptic membranes is the reversible, posttranslational <i>S</i>-palmitoylation at the C-termini of receptors. To clarify the role of palmitoylation-dependent regulation of AMPARs <i>in vivo</i>, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient (Cys811 to Ser substitution) knock-in mice. These mutant male mice showed elevated seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal activity without impairments in synaptic transmission, gross brain structure, or behavior at the basal level. Disruption of the palmitoylation site was accompanied by upregulated GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831, but not at Ser845, in the hippocampus and increased GluA1 protein expression in the cortex. Furthermore, GluA1 palmitoylation suppressed excessive spine enlargement above a certain size after LTP. Our findings indicate that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation can lead to hyperexcitability in the cerebrum, which negatively affects the maintenance of network stability, resulting in epileptic seizures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> AMPARs predominantly mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are regulated in a posttranslational, palmitoylation-dependent manner in excitatory synapses of the mammalian brain. Reversible palmitoylation dynamically controls synaptic expression and intracellular trafficking of the receptors. Here, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient knock-in mice to clarify the role of AMPAR palmitoylation <i>in vivo</i>. We showed that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation led to hyperexcitability, resulting in epileptic seizure. This is the first identification of a specific palmitoylated protein critical for the seizure-suppressing process. Our data also provide insight into how predicted receptors such as AMPARs can effectively preserve network stability in the brain. Furthermore, these findings help to define novel key targets for developing anti-epileptic drugs.</p>

<p>A photomicrograph of HeLa cells expressing amino acids 1‐149 of the protein KCTD7 with a mutation (L108M) seen in patients who have progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). The mutant protein has an HA tag that has been stained with red fluorescence to localize the protein, revealing red filaments in the nucleus and in the surrounding cytoplasm. Filament structures are altered by this L108M mutation in the BTB domain of KCTD7. The nucleus of each cell is stained blue.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;84:725–736</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Several small case series identified <i>KCTD7</i> mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Novel <i>KCTD7</i> variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>KCTD7</i> mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published <i>KCTD7</i> patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient <i>KCTD7</i> variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of <i>KCTD7</i> and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>KCTD7</i> mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. <i>KCTD7</i> deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

<p>
   <i>NBEA</i> is a candidate gene for autism, and de novo variants have been reported in neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) cohorts. However, <i>NBEA</i> has not been rigorously evaluated as a disease gene, and associated phenotypes have not been delineated. We identified 24 de novo <i>NBEA</i> variants in patients with NDD, establishing <i>NBEA</i> as an NDD gene. Most patients had epilepsy with onset in the first few years of life, often characterized by generalized seizure types, including myoclonic and atonic seizures. Our data show a broader phenotypic spectrum than previously described, including a myoclonic‐astatic epilepsy–like phenotype in a subset of patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:796–803</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health–related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population‐based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health–related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology–related changes has great utility for cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713–724</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive disease with weakness of bulbar and extremity muscles. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but several clinical trials have been conducted over the past years. The results from these trials have uncovered a great need to develop quantitative, reliable outcome measures. In this study, we prospectively investigated disease progression over 18 months in 29 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA, using quantitative outcome measures, including Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MRI to assess changes in muscle fat content and stationary dynamometry to assess changes in muscle strength. Disease progression was also investigated with the SBMA functional rating scale, bulbar rating scale, 6‐minute walk test, and blood samples, among others.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean muscle fat content, muscle strength in knee extensors, handgrip strength, walking distance, and creatinine levels changed significantly. Mean muscle fat content increased by 2 ± 1.25%, and knee extension strength decreased from 83 ± 60 to 76 ± 56Nm, handgrip strength from 31 ± 13 to 29 ± 13kg, walking distance from 362 ± 216 to 336 ± 219m, and creatinine level from 58 ± 21 to 54 ± 20 μmol/l. Functional rating scores did not change.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study demonstrates a slow and steady disease progression in SBMA. Dixon MRI detected increases in muscle fat content in all investigated muscles and is therefore a suitable candidate for an outcome measure in natural history or treatment studies in SBMA. The 6‐minute walk test and handgrip strength also seem to be reliable outcome measures for SBMA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:762–773</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize the pattern of neuron loss in hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS‐Aging) and age‐related diseases and to evaluate its contribution to cognitive impairment in the elderly.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 1,361) came from longitudinal observational studies of aging at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Relative neuron loss in the hippocampus of HS‐Aging was measured using unbiased stereological methods. Transactive response DNA‐binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP‐43) proteinopathy, a putative marker of HS‐Aging, was assessed. Clinical and cognitive data were analyzed using parametric statistical methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety‐three cases had HS‐Aging (6.8%), 8 cases had “pure” HS‐Aging, and 37 cases had comorbid intermediate or high Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change (i/h ADNC). Relative neuron loss (ratio of neuron number in hippocampal subfield CA1 to the neuron number in parahippocampal gyrus) was 0.15 for HS‐Aging; this was significantly lower than 0.64 for i/h ADNC and 0.66 for control cases (Kruskal‐Wallis test, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; <i>p</i> = 0.0003, respectively). TDP‐43 proteinopathy was present in 92.4% of HS‐Aging cases, higher than that in i/h ADNC (52%) and control (25%) cases. Pure HS‐Aging cases were more likely to have cognitive impairment in the memory domain.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Relative neuron loss in the hippocampus compared to the parahippocampus gyrus may be useful in distinguishing HS‐Aging in the context of comorbid ADNC. HS‐Aging contributes to cognitive impairment, which phenotypically resembles AD dementia. TDP proteinopathy is a frequent comorbidity in HS‐Aging and may contribute to cognitive impairment to a modest degree. Ann Neurol 2018;84:749–761</p>

<p>Etiologic diagnosis is uncertain in 35% to 50% of patients with encephalitis, despite its substantial global prevalence and disease burden. We report on 2 adult female patients with fatal leukoencephalitis associated with human pegivirus‐1 (HPgV‐1) brain infection. Neuroimaging showed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter. Brain‐derived HPgV‐1 RNA sequences clustered phylogenetically with other pegiviruses despite an 87‐nucleotide deletion in the viral nonstructural (NS)2 gene. Neuropathology disclosed lymphocyte infiltration and gliosis predominantly in brain white matter. HPgV‐1 NS5A antigen was detected in lymphocytes as well as in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. HPgV‐1 neuroadaptation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive leukoencephalitis in humans. Ann Neurol 2018;84:789–795</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whether intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC‐ICH) has a better outcome compared to ICH associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA‐ICH) is uncertain.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic review and individual patient data meta‐analysis of cohort studies comparing clinical and radiological outcomes between NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH patients. The primary outcome measure was 30‐day all‐cause mortality. All outcomes were assessed in multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, ICH location, and intraventricular hemorrhage extension.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 7 eligible studies comprising 219 NOAC‐ICH and 831 VKA‐ICH patients (mean age = 77 years, 52.5% females). The 30‐day mortality was similar between NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH (24.3% vs 26.5%; hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67–1.31). However, in multivariate analyses adjusting for potential confounders, NOAC‐ICH was associated with lower admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (linear regression coefficient = −2.83, 95% CI = −5.28 to −0.38), lower likelihood of severe stroke (NIHSS &gt; 10 points) on admission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30–0.84), and smaller baseline hematoma volume (linear regression coefficient = −0.24, 95% CI = −0.47 to −0.16). The two groups did not differ in the likelihood of baseline hematoma volume &lt; 30cm<sup>3</sup> (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.81–1.62), hematoma expansion (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63–1.48), in‐hospital mortality (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.49–1.11), functional status at discharge (common OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57–1.07), or functional status at 3 months (common OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.75–1.43).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although functional outcome at discharge, 1 month, or 3 months was comparable after NOAC‐ICH and VKA‐ICH, patients with NOAC‐ICH had smaller baseline hematoma volumes and less severe acute stroke syndromes. Ann Neurol 2018;84:702–712</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A recent study observed a 2‐fold greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) in relation to the β2‐adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol and a markedly lower risk of PD for the β2‐adrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol. We examined whether confounding by clinical indication for these medications, that is, tremor and smoking‐related pulmonary conditions, explained these associations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a large, population‐based case–control study of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 with diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and prescription data (48,295 incident PD cases, 52,324 controls), we examined the risk of PD in relation to use of selected β antagonists (propranolol, carvedilol, metoprolol), the β2 agonist salbutamol, and other medications used for the same clinical indications (primidone, inhaled corticosteroids). We adjusted for demographics, smoking, and overall use of medical care. We then examined the effect of also adjusting for clinical indication and applying medication exposure lagging.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Propranolol appeared to increase PD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.31–3.96). When we adjusted for tremor or abnormal involuntary movement prior to the PD diagnosis/reference date and lagged propranolol exposure, the association was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.80–1.18). Primidone, also used for tremor, was similarly sensitive to this adjustment and lagging. β Antagonists not indicated for tremor appeared to reduce PD risk (carvedilol: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.73–0.81; metoprolol: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91–0.97) and were insensitive to adjustment for indications and lagging. Neither salbutamol nor inhaled corticosteroids were consistently associated with PD risk.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists do not appear to alter PD risk. Ann Neurol 2018;84:691–701</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Muscle cramps occur in &gt;50% of diabetic patients and reduce the quality of life. No effective treatment is available. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (BTX‐A) injections for treating cramps in diabetic patients with neuropathy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This single‐center, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled perspective study investigated the efficacy and safety of BTX‐A intramuscular injection for treating calf or foot cramps refractory to common pharmacological drugs. Fifty diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and cramps were randomly assigned to 2 matched groups. BTX‐A (100 or 30 units) or saline was injected on each side into the gastrocnemius or the small flexor foot muscles. Changes in pain intensity (primary outcome) and cramp frequency were evaluated over the course of 20 weeks after BTX‐A administration. Cramp interference in daily life and the electrophysiological cramp threshold frequency were also measured. The treatment was repeated 5 months after first injection in 19 responders.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All outcome measures improved significantly after BTX‐A compared with placebo. The changes with respect to baseline were already significant after 1 week and persisted up to week 14. Only 5 of 25 (20%) patients were nonresponders (&lt;50% decrease of the primary outcome). The responses to a second BTX‐A injection provided results similar to the first administration. Mild pain at the injection site (4/25 cases) was the only adverse event, and it disappeared within 2 to 3 days.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Local BTX‐A infiltration is an efficacious and safe procedure for obtaining a sustained amelioration of muscle cramps associated with diabetic neuropathy. Ann Neurol 2018;84:682–690</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Riboflavin‐responsive multiple acyl–coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (RR‐MADD) is an inherited fatty acid metabolism disorder mainly caused by genetic defects in electron transfer flavoprotein–ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QO). The variant ETF:QO protein folding deficiency, which can be corrected by therapeutic dosage of riboflavin supplement, has been identified in HEK‐293 cells and is believed to be the molecular mechanism of this disease. To verify this hypothesis in vivo, we generated <i>Etfdh</i>
   <sup>
      <i>(h)A84T</i>
   </sup> knockin (KI) mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tissues from these mice as well as muscle biopsies and fibroblasts from 7 RR‐MADD patients were used to examine the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) concentration and ETF:QO protein amount.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All of the homozygous KI mice (<i>Etfdh</i>
   <sup>
      <i>(h)A84T/(h)A84T</i>
   </sup>, KI/KI) were initially normal. After being given a high‐fat and vitamin B<sub>2</sub>–deficient (HF‐B<sub>2</sub>D) diet for 5 weeks, they developed weight loss, movement ability defects, lipid storage in muscle and liver, and elevated serum acyl‐carnitine levels, which are clinically and biochemically similar to RR‐MADD patients. Both ETF:QO protein and FAD concentrations were significantly decreased in tissues of HF‐B<sub>2</sub>D–KI/KI mice and in cultured fibroblasts from RR‐MADD patients. After riboflavin treatment, ETF:QO protein increased in proportion to elevated FAD concentrations, but not related to mRNA levels. These results were further confirmed in cultured fibroblasts from RR‐MADD patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For the first time, we successfully developed a RR‐MADD mice model and confirmed that FAD homeostasis disturbances played a crucial role on the pathomechanism of RR‐MADD in this mouse model and culture cells from patients. Supplementation of riboflavin may stabilize variant ETF:QO protein by rebuilding FAD homeostasis. Ann Neurol 2018;84:667–681</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated the association of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, and total tau (tTau) with the presence of Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 248 subjects with SCD (61 ± 9 years, 42% female, Mini‐Mental State Examination = 28 ± 2) from the SCIENCe project and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Subjects were dichotomized as amyloid abnormal by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Baseline plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and tTau were measured using Simoa technology. Associations between plasma levels and amyloid status were assessed using logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Association of plasma levels with risk of clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifty‐seven (23%) subjects were CSF‐amyloid abnormal. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and plasma Abeta42 alone, but not tTau, identified abnormal CSF‐amyloid status (plasma ratio: area under the curve [AUC] = 77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 69–84%; plasma Abeta42: AUC = 66%, 95% CI: 58–74%). Combining plasma ratio with age and apolipoprotein E resulted in AUC = 83% (95% CI = 77–89%). The Youden cutoff of the plasma ratio gave a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 75%, and applying this as a prescreener would reduce the number of lumbar punctures by 51%. Using PET as outcome, a comparable reduction in number of PET scans would be achieved when applying the plasma ratio as prescreener. In addition, low plasma ratio was associated with clinical progression to MCI or dementia (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4–2.3).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio has potential as a prescreener to identify Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with SCD. Ann Neurol 2018;84:656–666</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a meta‐analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid‐β pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86%) than in nfvPPA (20%) or svPPA (16%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid‐β positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10% at age 50 years to 27% at age 80 years, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and svPPA (from 6% at age 50 years to 32% at age 80 years, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but not in lvPPA (<i>p</i> = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often amyloid‐β positive (58.0%) than noncarriers (35.0%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP‐43 in svPPA (80%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration–TDP‐43/tau in nfvPPA (64%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid‐β biomarkers in PPA patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:737–748</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify causes of the autosomal‐recessive malformation, diencephalic‐mesencephalic junction dysplasia (DMJD) syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eight families with DMJD were studied by whole‐exome or targeted sequencing, with detailed clinical and radiological characterization. Patient‐derived induced pluripotent stem cells were derived into neural precursor and endothelial cells to study gene expression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients showed biallelic mutations in the nonclustered <i>protocadherin‐12</i> (<i>PCDH12</i>) gene. The characteristic clinical presentation included progressive microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, psychomotor disability, epilepsy, and axial hypotonia with variable appendicular spasticity. Brain imaging showed brainstem malformations and with frequent thinned corpus callosum with punctate brain calcifications, reflecting expression of <i>PCDH12</i> in neural and endothelial cells. These cells showed lack of <i>PCDH12</i> expression and impaired neurite outgrowth.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMJD patients have biallelic mutations in <i>PCDH12</i> and lack of protein expression. These patients present with characteristic microcephaly and abnormalities of white matter tracts. Such pathogenic variants predict a poor outcome as a result of brainstem malformation and evidence of white matter tract defects, and should be added to the phenotypic spectrum associated with <i>PCDH12</i>‐related conditions.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most frequent heritable muscular dystrophies, with a large variety in age at onset and disease severity. The natural history and molecular characteristics of FSHD in childhood are incompletely understood. Our objective is to clinically and genetically characterize FSHD in childhood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a nationwide, single‐investigator, natural history study on FSHD in childhood.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Multiple‐source recruitment resulted in 32 patients with FSHD (0–17 years), leading to an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 children in The Netherlands. This series of 32 children with FSHD revealed a heterogeneous phenotype and genotype in childhood. The phenotypic hallmarks of FSHD in childhood are: facial weakness with normal or only mildly affected motor performance, decreased functional exercise capacity (6‐minute walk test), lumbar hyperlordosis, and increased echo intensity on muscle ultrasonography. In addition, pain and fatigue were frequent and patients experienced a lower quality of life compared to healthy peers. In contrast to the literature on early‐onset FSHD, systemic features such as hearing loss and retinal and cardiac abnormalities were infrequent and subclinical, and epilepsy and intellectual disability were absent. Genotypically, patients had a mean D4Z4 repeat array of 5 units (range, 2–9), and 14% of the mutations were de novo.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FSHD in childhood is more prevalent than previously known and the genotype resembles classic FSHD. Importantly, FSHD mainly affects functional exercise capacity and quality of life in children. As such, these results are paramount for counseling, clinical management, and stratification in clinical research. Ann Neurol 2018;84:635–645</p>

<p>Stigmergy has proved its great superiority in terms of distributed control,
robustness and adaptability, thus being regarded as an ideal solution for
large-scale swarm control problems. Based on new discoveries on astrocytes in
regulating synaptic transmission in the brain, this paper has mapped stigmergy
mechanism into the interaction between synapses and investigated its
characteristics and advantages. Particularly, we have divided the interaction
between synapses which are not directly connected into three phases and
proposed a stigmergic learning model. In this model, the state change of a
stigmergy agent will expand its influence to affect the states of others. The
strength of the interaction is determined by the level of neural activity as
well as the distance between stigmergy agents. Inspired by the morphological
and functional changes in astrocytes during environmental enrichment, it is
likely that the regulation of distance between stigmergy agents plays a
critical role in the stigmergy learning process. Simulation results have
verified its importance and indicated that the well-regulated distance between
stigmergy agents can help to obtain stigmergy learning gain.

How does our brain give rise to passive or active defensive responses when we are confronted with threats? In a recent study in Cell, Terburg, Scheggia and colleagues (Terburg et al., 2018) show that, in both humans and rats, a pathway originating from the amygdala can help suppress passive responses, thereby facilitating active responses to imminent threats.

The cerebellum, a brain structure historically considered to be important for motor coordination, is often overlooked in terms of its role in higher-order control processing. Using resting-state functional connectivity and precision mapping, Marek et al. (2018) illuminate the cerebellum as an important source of individual variation in brain function and cognition.

In this issue of Neuron, Lopes-Dos-Santos et al.

During motor adaptation, the brain must learn to produce new muscle outputs without disrupting the intricate coordination between numerous motor areas. A new paper (Perich et al., 2018) shows how adaptation can occur in a subset of neural dimensions and avoid muddling inter-area communication.

<p>by Ryan R. Wick, Louise M. Judd, Kathryn E. Holt</p>

Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zSKzkzc7_uc" width="1" />

<p>by Yusuf Ozuysal, David B. Kastner, Stephen A. Baccus</p>

To transmit information efficiently in a changing environment, the retina adapts to visual contrast by adjusting its gain, latency and mean response. Additionally, the temporal frequency selectivity, or bandwidth changes to encode the absolute intensity when the stimulus environment is noisy, and intensity differences when noise is low. We show that the On pathway of On-Off retinal amacrine and ganglion cells is required to change temporal bandwidth but not other adaptive properties. This remarkably specific adaptive mechanism arises from differential effects of contrast on the On and Off pathways. We analyzed a biophysical model fit only to a cell’s membrane potential, and verified pharmacologically that it accurately revealed the two pathways. We conclude that changes in bandwidth arise mostly from differences in synaptic threshold in the two pathways, rather than synaptic release dynamics as has previously been proposed to underlie contrast adaptation. Different efficient codes are selected by different thresholds in two independently adapting neural pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sklOjZc6RaM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.</p>

Abstract<p>The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In <i>C. elegans,</i> RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Simple head orientation behaviors in <i>C. elegans</i> provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.</p>

Abstract
<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592">Coding with transient trajectories in recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1811.07592v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time
and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet an understanding of the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a
population code based on transient trajectories is still missing. Here we show
that a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of recurrently connected
units exhibits the properties needed for transient coding. We first identify a
general criterion that distinguishes two classes of networks depending on
properties of the connectivity matrix: networks in which all inputs lead to
weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs elicit
strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal output
states during the dynamics. For the second class of networks, we provide a
procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the corresponding
readouts for arbitrary connectivity matrices. We then exploit our approach to
build the minimal connectivity which robustly implements trajectories that map
a specific input onto a specific output state, and we demonstrate that the
capacity of the obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

The robust computational design of functional proteins has the potential to deeply impact translational research and broaden our understanding of the determinants of protein function and stability. The low success rates of computational design protocols and the extensive in vitro optimization often required, highlight the challenge of designing proteins that perform essential biochemical functions, such as binding or catalysis. One of the most simplistic approaches for the design of function is to adopt functional motifs in naturally occurring proteins and transplant them to computationally designed proteins. The structural complexity of the functional motif largely determines how readily one can find host protein structures that are “designable”, meaning that are likely to present the functional motif in the desired conformation. One promising route to enhance the “designability” of protein structures is to allow backbone flexibility. Here, we present a computational approach that couples conformational folding with sequence design to embed functional motifs into heterologous proteins—Rosetta Functional Folding and Design (FunFolDes). We performed extensive computational benchmarks, where we observed that the enforcement of functional requirements resulted in designs distant from the global energetic minimum of the protein. An observation consistent with several experimental studies that have revealed function-stability tradeoffs. To test the design capabilities of FunFolDes we transplanted two viral epitopes into distant structural templates including one <i>de novo</i> “functionless” fold, which represent two typical challenges where the designability problem arises. The designed proteins were experimentally characterized showing high binding affinities to monoclonal antibodies, making them valuable candidates for vaccine design endeavors. Overall, we present an accessible strategy to repurpose old protein folds for new functions. This may lead to important improvements on the computational design of proteins, with structurally complex functional sites, that can perform elaborate biochemical functions related to binding and catalysis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7gRf2xrFcak" width="1" />

Recent advances in modeling oxygen supply to cortical brain tissue have begun to elucidate the functional mechanisms of neurovascular coupling. While the principal mechanisms of blood flow regulation after neuronal firing are generally known, mechanistic hemodynamic simulations cannot yet pinpoint the exact spatial and temporal coordination between the network of arteries, arterioles, capillaries and veins for the entire brain. Because of the potential significance of blood flow and oxygen supply simulations for illuminating spatiotemporal regulation inside the cortical microanatomy, there is a need to create mathematical models of the entire cerebral circulation with realistic anatomical detail. Our hypothesis is that an anatomically accurate reconstruction of the cerebrocirculatory architecture will inform about possible regulatory mechanisms of the neurovascular interface. In this article, we introduce large-scale networks of the murine cerebral circulation spanning the Circle of Willis, main cerebral arteries connected to the pial network down to the microcirculation in the capillary bed. Several multiscale models were generated from state-of-the-art neuroimaging data. Using a vascular network construction algorithm, the entire circulation of the middle cerebral artery was synthesized. Blood flow simulations indicate a consistent trend of higher hematocrit in deeper cortical layers, while surface layers with shorter vascular path lengths seem to carry comparatively lower red blood cell (RBC) concentrations. Moreover, the variability of RBC flux decreases with cortical depth. These results support the notion that plasma skimming serves a self-regulating function for maintaining uniform oxygen perfusion to neurons irrespective of their location in the blood supply hierarchy. Our computations also demonstrate the practicality of simulating blood flow for large portions of the mouse brain with existing computer resources. The efficient simulation of blood flow throughout the entire middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is a promising milestone towards the final aim of predicting blood flow patterns for the entire brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OY-184gvy8" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing <i>in vivo</i> microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different <i>ex vivo</i> experimental conditions, as well as from <i>in vivo</i> data, and images of other branching cell types.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0137-18.2018v1?rss=1">Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (<i>E<sub>GABA</sub></i>) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.</p>

<p>by Andrej Berg, Oleksandra Kukharenko, Martin Scheffner, Christine Peter</p>

Covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. Different types of ubiquitin chains are assumed to selectively signal respectively modified proteins for different fates. In support of this hypothesis, structural studies have shown that the eight possible ubiquitin dimers adopt different conformations. However, at least in some cases, these structures cannot sufficiently explain the molecular basis of the selective signaling mechanisms. This indicates that the available structures represent only a few distinct conformations within the entire conformational space adopted by a ubiquitin dimer. Here, molecular simulations on different levels of resolution can complement the structural information. We have combined exhaustive coarse grained and atomistic simulations of all eight possible ubiquitin dimers with a suitable dimensionality reduction technique and a new method to characterize protein-protein interfaces and the conformational landscape of protein conjugates. We found that ubiquitin dimers exhibit characteristic linkage type-dependent properties in solution, such as interface stability and the character of contacts between the subunits, which can be directly correlated with experimentally observed linkage-specific properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6aIN2Kla9rU" width="1" />

<p>by Joana C. Xavier, Kiran Raosaheb Patil, Isabel Rocha</p>

Essential metabolic reactions are shaping constituents of metabolic networks, enabling viable and distinct phenotypes across diverse life forms. Here we analyse and compare modelling predictions of essential metabolic functions with experimental data and thereby identify core metabolic pathways in prokaryotes. Simulations of 15 manually curated genome-scale metabolic models were integrated with 36 large-scale gene essentiality datasets encompassing a wide variety of species of bacteria and archaea. Conservation of metabolic genes was estimated by analysing 79 representative genomes from all the branches of the prokaryotic tree of life. We find that essentiality patterns reflect phylogenetic relations both for modelling and experimental data, which correlate highly at the pathway level. Genes that are essential for several species tend to be highly conserved as opposed to non-essential genes which may be conserved or not. The tRNA-charging module is highlighted as ancestral and with high centrality in the networks, followed closely by cofactor metabolism, pointing to an early information processing system supplied by organic cofactors. The results, which point to model improvements and also indicate faults in the experimental data, should be relevant to the study of centrality in metabolic networks and ancient metabolism but also to metabolic engineering with prokaryotes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YfypktDVdWM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play multiple roles during development. In the embryonic cerebral wall, microglia modulate the functions of neural stem/progenitor cells through their distribution in regions undergoing cell proliferation and/or differentiation. Previous studies using CX3CR1-GFP transgenic mice demonstrated that microglia extensively survey these regions. To simultaneously visualize microglia and neural-lineage cells that interact with each other, we applied the <i>in utero</i> electroporation (IUE) technique, which has been widely used for gene-transfer in neurodevelopmental studies, to CX3CR1-GFP mice (males and females). However, we unexpectedly faced a technical problem: although microglia are normally distributed homogeneously throughout the mid-embryonic cortical wall with only limited luminal entry, the intraventricular presence of exogenously derived plasmid DNAs induced microglia to accumulate along the apical surface of the cortex and aggregate in the choroid plexus. This effect was independent of capillary needle puncture of the brain wall or application of electrical pulses. The microglial response occurred at plasmid DNA concentrations lower than those routinely used for IUE, and was mediated by activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immune sensor that recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs abundant in microbial DNA. Administration of plasmid DNA together with oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, the antagonist of TLR9, restored the normal (dispersed) intramural localization of microglia and decreased luminal accumulation of these cells. Thus, via TLR9, intraventricular plasmid DNA administration causes aberrant distribution of embryonic microglia, suggesting that the behavior of microglia in brain primordia subjected to IUE should be carefully interpreted.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Microglia have been recently shown to play multiple roles in the embryonic brain. In the trials for labeling neural-lineage cells using IUE technique in CX3CR1-GFP mice, in which microglia express GFP, to achieve dual live-imaging of these cell types, we unexpectedly found that intra-ventricular administration of plasmid DNA caused microglial aberrant accumulation along the luminal surface of the cerebral wall and in the choroid plexus. Notably, Co-administration of TLR9 antagonist into the ventricle together with plasmid DNA restored the normal dispersed localization of microglia in the mid-embryonic (E14) cortex, suggesting that massive microglial accumulation induced by plasmid DNA is primarily mediated by TLR9 activation. Our findings have implications for the application of IUE to investigate embryonic microglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>Survival Motor Neuron</i> (<i>SMN1</i>) gene. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) mutants lacking <i>SMN</i> recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span extension conferred benefits to <i>C. elegans</i> lacking SMN. We find that reducing DAF-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves locomotor behavior in this <i>C. elegans</i> model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in <i>C. elegans</i> lacking <i>SMN</i> correlated with structural and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction in DAF-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> SMA is a pediatric motor neuron disease resulting from the loss of the SMN protein. While great effort has been expended on interventions aimed at increasing levels of compensatory SMN1, identification of genes that modify the SMA phenotype has lagged. Here we undertook a targeted genetic screen to identify SMA disease suppressors. We demonstrated that reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling is beneficial for not only longevity but also locomotor activity in SMA worm models. Our results from anatomical, functional, and genetic studies show that the impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission contributes to locomotor dysfunction in <i>smn-1</i> null worms. Enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission alone can correct the locomotor dysfunction. This work leads to new understanding of disease pathogenesis and opens up new opportunities for therapy.</p>

Abstract<p>Treatments to stop gray matter degeneration are needed to prevent progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). We tested whether inhibiting mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs), which can drive inflammatory microglial activation and neuronal degeneration, could protect hippocampal synapses in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a disease model that recapitulates the excitatory synaptic injury that occurs widely within the gray matter in MS. URMC-099, a broad spectrum MLK inhibitor with additional activity against LRRK2 and other kinases, prevented loss of PSD95-positive postsynaptic structures, shifted activated microglia toward a less inflammatory phenotype, and reversed deficits in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning in EAE mice when administered after the onset of motor symptoms. A narrow spectrum inhibitor designed to be highly selective for MLK3 failed to protect synapses in EAE hippocampi, and could not rescue cultured neurons from trophic deprivation in an <i>in vitro</i> model of MLK-driven neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS, and demonstrate that a broad spectrum of inhibition against a combination of MLK and other kinases is more effective in neuroinflammatory disease than selectively targeting a single kinase.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive neurologic decline that correlates with damage to gray matter in the brain, and is not stopped by current treatments. We used a mouse model of MS, in which gray matter injury is associated with inflammatory molecules produced by activated microglia, to test novel neuroprotective treatments. URMC-099, a mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties, prevented loss of hippocampal synapses and reversed deficits in learning and memory in a mouse model of MS. An MLK inhibitor with a narrower range of specificity was not effective, suggesting that combination kinase inhibition with URMC-099 may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment in MS.</p>

Abstract
<p>Memory formation is a protracted process that initially involves the hippocampus and becomes increasingly dependent on the cortex over time, but the mechanisms of this transfer are unclear. We recently showed that hippocampal depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z enhances both recent and remote memories, but the use of virally mediated depletion reduced H2A.Z levels throughout testing, making its temporally specific function unclear. Given the lack of drugs that target histone variants, we tested existing drugs for efficacy against H2A.Z based on their targeting of known H2A.Z regulators. The Tip60 (part of H2A.Z deposition complex) inhibitor Nu9056 reduced H2A.Z binding, whereas the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin-A increased H2A.Z acetylation without influencing total H2A.Z in cultured hippocampal neurons. Tip60 (but not HDAC) inhibition 23 h after learning enhanced remote (tested at 7 d) and not recent (tested at 24 h) contextual fear memory in mice. In contrast, Tip60 inhibition 30 d after learning impaired recall of remote memory after 1 h, but protected the memory from further decline 24 h later. These data provide the first evidence of a delayed postlearning role for histone variants in supporting memory transfer during systems consolidation.</p>

<p>A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food, and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type (WT) mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 knock-out (KO) mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.</p>

<p>Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse <i>in vivo</i> two-photon imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover rates of neocortical spines <i>in vivo</i>. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a greater extent in a mouse model (<i>Fmr1</i> knockout) of fragile X mental retardation than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice could be represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent differences in the statistical distribution in <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice even in adulthood, which reflects the abnormal <i>in vivo</i> dynamics of spine volumes.</p>

Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.

<p>by Nils Klughammer, Johanna Bischof, Nikolas D. Schnellbächer, Andrea Callegari, Péter Lénárt, Ulrich S. Schwarz</p>

Cytoplasmic flows are an ubiquitous feature of biological systems, in particular in large cells, such as oocytes and eggs in early animal development. Here we show that cytoplasmic flows in starfish oocytes, which can be imaged well with transmission light microscopy, are fully determined by the cortical dynamics during surface contraction waves. We first show that the dynamics of the oocyte surface is highly symmetric around the animal-vegetal axis. We then mathematically solve the Stokes equation for flows inside a deforming sphere using the measured surface displacements as boundary conditions. Our theoretical predictions agree very well with the intracellular flows quantified by particle image velocimetry, proving that during this stage the starfish cytoplasm behaves as a simple Newtonian fluid on the micrometer scale. We calculate the pressure field inside the oocyte and find that its gradient is too small as to explain polar body extrusion, in contrast to earlier suggestions. Myosin II inhibition by blebbistatin confirms this conclusion, because it diminishes cell shape changes and hydrodynamic flow, but does not abolish polar body formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TABMnyJYzl0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/WfAj38t5J5A/article">Patterning the insect eye: From stochastic to deterministic mechanisms</a></h4>

<p>by Haleh Ebadi, Michael Perry, Keith Short, Konstantin Klemm, Claude Desplan, Peter F. Stadler, Anita Mehta</p>

While most processes in biology are highly deterministic, stochastic mechanisms are sometimes used to increase cellular diversity. In human and Drosophila eyes, photoreceptors sensitive to different wavelengths of light are distributed in stochastic patterns, and one such patterning system has been analyzed in detail in the Drosophila retina. Interestingly, some species in the dipteran family Dolichopodidae (the “long legged” flies, or “Doli”) instead exhibit highly orderly deterministic eye patterns. In these species, alternating columns of ommatidia (unit eyes) produce corneal lenses of different colors. Occasional perturbations in some individuals disrupt the regular columns in a way that suggests that patterning occurs via a posterior-to-anterior signaling relay during development, and that specification follows a local, cellular-automaton-like rule. We hypothesize that the regulatory mechanisms that pattern the eye are largely conserved among flies and that the difference between unordered Drosophila and ordered dolichopodid eyes can be explained in terms of relative strengths of signaling interactions rather than a rewiring of the regulatory network itself. We present a simple stochastic model that is capable of explaining both the stochastic Drosophila eye and the striped pattern of Dolichopodidae eyes and thereby characterize the least number of underlying developmental rules necessary to produce both stochastic and deterministic patterns. We show that only small changes to model parameters are needed to also reproduce intermediate, semi-random patterns observed in another Doli species, and quantification of ommatidial distributions in these eyes suggests that their patterning follows similar rules.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WfAj38t5J5A" width="1" />

Ponce-Alvarez et al. show that zebrafish larvae generate spontaneous neuronal avalanches across the entire brain. These collective cascading events exhibit scale invariance, typical of critical phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, paper crumpling). The brain’s critical dynamics are modulated during interactions with the environment.

Tripathy et al. show that mutations in MAST1, a microtubule-associated protein, cause a syndrome characterized by an enlarged corpus callosum. They attribute this thickening to an increase in the number of contralateral projections despite extensive cortical apoptosis.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adolescence is marked by increased vulnerability to mental disorders and maladaptive behaviors, including anorexia nervosa. Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human brain undergoes dramatic structural changes during childhood that co-occur with behavioral development. These age-related changes are documented for the brain’s gray matter and white matter. However, their interrelation is largely unknown.

<p>by Marie Levakova, Lubomir Kostal, Christelle Monsempès, Vincent Jacob, Philippe Lucas</p>

The efficient coding hypothesis predicts that sensory neurons adjust their coding resources to optimally represent the stimulus statistics of their environment. To test this prediction in the moth olfactory system, we have developed a stimulation protocol that mimics the natural temporal structure within a turbulent pheromone plume. We report that responses of antennal olfactory receptor neurons to pheromone encounters follow the temporal fluctuations in such a way that the most frequent stimulus timescales are encoded with maximum accuracy. We also observe that the average coding precision of the neurons adjusted to the stimulus-timescale statistics at a given distance from the pheromone source is higher than if the same encoding model is applied at a shorter, non-matching, distance. Finally, the coding accuracy profile and the stimulus-timescale distribution are related in the manner predicted by the information theory for the many-to-one convergence scenario of the moth peripheral sensory system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3ETnhHC120" width="1" />

<p>by William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma</p>

Humans can meaningfully report their confidence in a perceptual or cognitive decision. It is widely believed that these reports reflect the Bayesian probability that the decision is correct, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested against non-Bayesian alternatives. We use two perceptual categorization tasks in which Bayesian confidence reporting requires subjects to take sensory uncertainty into account in a specific way. We find that subjects do take sensory uncertainty into account when reporting confidence, suggesting that brain areas involved in reporting confidence can access low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite of Bayesian inference. However, behavior is not fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis and is better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in a non-Bayesian way. Both conclusions are robust to changes in the uncertainty manipulation, task, response modality, model comparison metric, and additional flexibility in the Bayesian model. Our results suggest that adhering to a rational account of confidence behavior may require incorporating implementational constraints.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1ezyXe_qUo" width="1" />

<p>by Erik M. Volz, Igor Siveroni</p>

Population genetic modeling can enhance Bayesian phylogenetic inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package <i>PhyDyn</i> for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwoD24QGeY" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Akinesia, a cardinal symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been linked to abnormal activation in putamen and posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). However, little is known whether clinical severity of akinesia is linked to dysfunctional connectivity of these regions. Using a seed-based approach, we here investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of putamen, pMFC and primary motor cortex (M1) in 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease on regular medication and 72 healthy controls. We found that in patients putamen featured decreases of connectivity for a number of cortical and subcortical areas engaged in sensorimotor and cognitive processing. In contrast, the pMFC showed reduced connectivity with a more focal cortical network involved in higher-level motor-cognition. Finally, M1 featured a selective disruption of connectivity in a network specifically connected with M1. Correlating clinical impairment with connectivity changes revealed a relationship between akinesia and reduced RSFC between pMFC and left intraparietal lobule (IPL). Together, the present study demonstrated RSFC decreases in networks for motor initiation and execution in Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, results suggest a relationship between pMFC-IPL decoupling and the manifestation of akinetic symptoms.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The first voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed in 282 patients with major depressive disorder compared with 254 controls, some higher, and some lower FCs. However, in 125 unmedicated patients, primarily increases of FC were found: of the subcallosal anterior cingulate with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, of the pregenual/supracallosal anterior cingulate with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and of parts of the anterior cingulate with the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and with early cortical visual areas. In the 157 medicated patients, these and other FCs were lower than in the unmedicated group. Parcellation was performed based on the FC of individual ACC voxels in healthy controls. A pregenual subdivision had high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and a supracallosal subdivision had high FC with lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The high FC in depression between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the subcallosal parts of the ACC provides a mechanism for more non-reward information transmission to the ACC, contributing to depression. The high FC between the medial orbitofrontal cortex and supracallosal ACC in depression may also contribute to depressive symptoms.</span>
