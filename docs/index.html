              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00777">Quantum Measurement, Entanglement and the Warping Mechanism of Human Perception</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the quantum measurement process contains the same warping mechanism that occurs in categorical perception, a phenomenon ubiquitous in human perception. This warping causes stimuli belonging to the same category to be perceived as more similar, while stimuli belonging to different categories are perceived as more different. As a result of a detailed study of the quantum measurement using the Bloch representation, we identify the natural metric for pure states, namely the Fubini Study metric, and the natural metric for density states, namely the trace class metric. The warping mechanism of categorical perception is then manifested, when the distances between pure states, playing the role of stimuli for the quantum measurement, are warped into the distances between density states, playing the role of percepts for quantum measurement. We work out the example of a two-dimensional quantum model, a qubit, with 'light' and 'dark' as the two eigenstates, and show how the typical contraction and dilation warping of human perception manifest themselves in this example of the quantum measurement model of light and dark.

                arXiv:2505.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying preictal states -- periods during which seizures are more likely to occur -- remains a central challenge in clinical computational neuroscience. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that embeds functional brain connectivity networks, derived from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This compact representation captures essential topological features of brain dynamics and facilitates the detection of subtle connectivity changes preceding seizures. Using standard machine learning techniques, we define a dimensionless biomarker, $\mathcal{B}$, that discriminates between interictal (seizure-free) and preictal (within 24 hours of seizure) network states. Our method focuses on connectivity patterns among a subset of informative iEEG electrodes, enabling robust classification of brain states across time. We validate our approach using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme and a pseudo-prospective forecasting strategy, assessing performance with metrics such as F1-score and balanced accuracy. Results show that low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings of iEEG connectivity yield interpretable and predictive markers of preictal activity, offering promising implications for real-time seizure forecasting and individualized therapeutic interventions.

                arXiv:2505.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a fundamental computational motif in neural circuits, supporting diverse cognitive functions through stable, self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. In these lecture notes, we review four key examples that demonstrate how autoassociative neural network models can elucidate the computational mechanisms underlying attractor-based information processing in biological neural systems performing cognitive functions. Drawing on empirical evidence, we explore hippocampal spatial representations, visual classification in the inferotemporal cortex, perceptual adaptation and priming, and working-memory biases shaped by sensory history. Across these domains, attractor network models reveal common computational principles and provide analytical insights into how experience shapes neural activity and behavior. Our synthesis underscores the value of attractor models as powerful tools for probing the neural basis of cognition and behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01178">A flexible Bayesian non-parametric mixture model reveals multiple dependencies of swap errors in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behavioural data in psychophysics has been used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive processes, such as attention, sensorimotor integration, and perceptual decision making. Visual working memory has particularly benefited from this approach: analyses of VWM errors have proven crucial for understanding VWM capacity and coding schemes, in turn constraining neural models of both. One poorly understood class of VWM errors are swap errors, whereby participants recall an uncued item from memory. Swap errors could arise from erroneous memory encoding, noisy storage, or errors at retrieval time - previous research has mostly implicated the latter two. However, these studies made strong a priori assumptions on the detailed mechanisms and/or parametric form of errors contributed by these sources. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach instead, introducing a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model of swap errors (BNS) which provides a flexible descriptive model of swapping behaviour, such that swaps are allowed to depend on both the probed and reported features of every stimulus item. We fit BNS to the trial-by-trial behaviour of human participants and show that it recapitulates the strong dependence of swaps on cue similarity in multiple datasets. Critically, BNS reveals that this dependence coexists with a non-monotonic modulation in the report feature dimension for a random dot motion direction-cued, location-reported dataset. The form of the modulation inferred by BNS opens new questions about the importance of memory encoding in causing swap errors in VWM, a distinct source to the previously suggested binding and cueing errors. Our analyses, combining qualitative comparisons of the highly interpretable BNS parameter structure with rigorous quantitative model comparison and recovery methods, show that previous interpretations of swap errors may have been incomplete.

                arXiv:2503.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesized signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be reused for gender classification task, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline and a model trained directly on EEG data. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00803">To Repair or Not to Repair? Investigating the Importance of AB-Cycles for the State-of-the-Art TSP Heuristic EAX</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Edge Assembly Crossover (EAX) algorithm is the state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It regularly outperforms other methods, such as the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun heuristic (LKH), across diverse sets of TSP instances. Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism that focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and, subsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm has been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in particular, its first stage has hardly been examined.
  In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel method that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its internal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to be repaired. Knowledge of the latter is also particularly relevant before applying other powerful crossover operators such as the Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX). Based on our insights, we propose and evaluate several improved versions of EAX. According to our benchmark study across 10 000 different TSP instances, the most promising of our proposed EAX variants demonstrates improved computational efficiency and solution quality on previously rather difficult instances compared to the current state-of-the-art EAX algorithm.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01077">Zero-Shot Document-Level Biomedical Relation Extraction via Scenario-based Prompt Design in Two-Stage with LLM</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), many researchers are attempting to extract structured information from document-level biomedical literature by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). However, they face significant challenges such as the need for expensive hardware, like high-performance GPUs and the high labor costs associated with annotating training datasets, especially in biomedical realm. Recent research on LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Llama3, has shown promising performance in zero-shot settings, inspiring us to explore a novel approach to achieve the same results from unannotated full documents using general LLMs with lower hardware and labor costs. Our approach combines two major stages: named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). NER identifies chemical, disease and gene entities from the document with synonym and hypernym extraction using an LLM with a crafted prompt. RE extracts relations between entities based on predefined relation schemas and prompts. To enhance the effectiveness of prompt, we propose a five-part template structure and a scenario-based prompt design principles, along with evaluation method to systematically assess the prompts. Finally, we evaluated our approach against fine-tuning and pre-trained models on two biomedical datasets: ChemDisGene and CDR. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method can achieve comparable accuracy levels to fine-tuning and pre-trained models but with reduced human and hardware expenses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01256">A First Runtime Analysis of NSGA-III on a Many-Objective Multimodal Problem: Provable Exponential Speedup via Stochastic Population Update</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NSGA-III is a prominent algorithm in evolutionary many-objective optimization. It is well-suited for optimizing functions with more than three objectives, setting it apart from the classic NSGA-II. However, theoretical insights about NSGA-III of when and why it performs well are still in its early development. This paper addresses this point and conducts a rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on the many-objective \textsc{OneJumpZeroJump} benchmark (\textsc{OjZj} for short), providing the first runtime bounds where the number of objectives is constant. We show that NSGA-III finds the Pareto front of \textsc{OjZj} in time $O(n^{k+d/2}+ \mu n \ln(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the number of objectives, $k$ is the gap size, a problem specific parameter, if its population size $\mu \in 2^{O(n)}$ is at least $(2n/d+1)^{d/2}$. Notably, NSGA-III is faster than NSGA-II by a factor of $\mu/n^{d/2}$ for some $\mu \in \omega(n^{d/2})$. We also show that a stochastic population update, proposed by Bian et al., provably guarantees a speedup of order $\Theta((k/b)^{k-1})$ in the runtime where $b>0$ is a constant. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on \textsc{OjZj}. Proving these bounds requires a much deeper understanding of the population dynamics of NSGA-III than previous papers achieved.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01262">Thinking Outside the Template with Modular GP-GOMEA</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal in Symbolic Regression (SR) is to discover expressions that accurately map input to output data. Because often the intent is to understand these expressions, there is a trade-off between accuracy and the interpretability of expressions. GP-GOMEA excels at producing small SR expressions (increasing the potential for interpretability) with high accuracy, but requires a fixed tree template, which limits the types of expressions that can be evolved. This paper presents a modular representation for GP-GOMEA that allows multiple trees to be evolved simultaneously that can be used as (functional) subexpressions. While each tree individually is constrained to a (small) fixed tree template, the final expression, if expanded, can exhibit a much larger structure. Furthermore, the use of subexpressions decomposes the original regression problem and opens the possibility for enhanced interpretability through the piece-wise understanding of small subexpressions. We compare the performance of GP-GOMEA with and without modular templates on a variety of datasets. We find that our proposed approach generally outperforms single-template GP-GOMEA and can moreover uncover ground-truth expressions underlying synthetic datasets with modular subexpressions at a faster rate than GP-GOMEA without modular subexpressions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01266">Tight Runtime Guarantees From Understanding the Population Dynamics of the GSEMO Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (GSEMO) is a simple, yet often effective multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). By only maintaining non-dominated solutions, it has a variable population size that automatically adjusts to the needs of the optimization process. The downside of the dynamic population size is that the population dynamics of this algorithm are harder to understand, resulting, e.g., in the fact that only sporadic tight runtime analyses exist. In this work, we significantly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the GSEMO, in particular, for the classic CountingOnesCountingZeros (COCZ) benchmark. From this, we prove a lower bound of order $\Omega(n^2 \log n)$, for the first time matching the seminal upper bounds known for over twenty years. We also show that the GSEMO finds any constant fraction of the Pareto front in time $O(n^2)$, improving over the previous estimate of $O(n^2 \log n)$ for the time to find the first Pareto optimum. Our methods extend to other classic benchmarks and yield, e.g., the first $\Omega(n^{k+1})$ lower bound for the OJZJ benchmark in the case that the gap parameter is $k \in \{2,3\}$. We are therefore optimistic that our new methods will be useful in future mathematical analyses of MOEAs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new optimisation algorithm, called Adaptive Bacterial Colony Optimisation (ABCO), modelled after the foraging behaviour of E. coli bacteria. The algorithm follows three stages--explore, exploit and reproduce--and is adaptable to meet the requirements of its applications. The performance of the proposed ABCO algorithm is compared to that of established optimisation algorithms--particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and ant colony optimisation (ACO)--on a set of benchmark functions. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the adaptive nature of the proposed algorithm: ABCO runs much faster than PSO and ACO while producing competitive results and outperforms PSO and ACO in a scenario where the running time is not crucial.

                arXiv:2505.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA, the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) is one of the most prominent dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Different from the NSGA-II, it does not employ the crowding distance (essentially the distance to neighboring solutions) to compare pairwise non-dominating solutions but a complex system of $\sigma$-distances that builds on the distances to all other solutions. In this work, we give a first mathematical proof showing that this more complex system of distances can be superior. More specifically, we prove that a simple steady-state SPEA2 can compute optimal approximations of the Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark in polynomial time. The best proven guarantee for a comparable variant of the NSGA-II only assures approximation ratios of roughly a factor of two, and both mathematical analyses and experiments indicate that optimal approximations are not found efficiently.

                arXiv:2505.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, camera localization has been widely adopted in autonomous robotic navigation due to its efficiency and convenience. However, autonomous navigation in unknown environments often suffers from scene ambiguity, environmental disturbances, and dynamic object transformation in camera localization. To address this problem, inspired by the biological brain navigation mechanism (such as grid cells, place cells, and head direction cells), we propose a novel neurobiological camera location method, namely NeuroLoc. Firstly, we designed a Hebbian learning module driven by place cells to save and replay historical information, aiming to restore the details of historical representations and solve the issue of scene fuzziness. Secondly, we utilized the head direction cell-inspired internal direction learning as multi-head attention embedding to help restore the true orientation in similar scenes. Finally, we added a 3D grid center prediction in the pose regression module to reduce the final wrong prediction. We evaluate the proposed NeuroLoc on commonly used benchmark indoor and outdoor datasets. The experimental results show that our NeuroLoc can enhance the robustness in complex environments and improve the performance of pose regression by using only a single image.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

                arXiv:2505.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Hopfield networks, using Hebbian learning, face severe storage capacity limits ($\approx 0.14$ P/N) and spurious attractors. Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) offers a non-linear approach, mapping patterns to high-dimensional feature spaces for improved separability. Our previous work showed KLR dramatically improves capacity and noise robustness over conventional methods. This paper quantitatively analyzes the attractor structures in KLR-trained networks via extensive simulations. We evaluated recall from diverse initial states across wide storage loads (up to 4.0 P/N) and noise levels. We quantified convergence rates and speed. Our analysis confirms KLR's superior performance: high capacity (up to 4.0 P/N) and robustness. The attractor landscape is remarkably "clean," with near-zero spurious fixed points. Recall failures under high load/noise are primarily due to convergence to other learned patterns, not spurious ones. Dynamics are exceptionally fast (typically 1-2 steps for high-similarity states). This characterization reveals how KLR reshapes dynamics for high-capacity associative memory, highlighting its effectiveness and contributing to AM understanding.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for neural network structures with better translation results, we considered perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation metric.

                arXiv:2505.00251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is crucial in scientific and industrial applications where solutions must balance trade-offs among conflicting objectives. State-of-the-art methods, such as NSGA-III and MOEA/D, can handle many objectives but struggle with coverage issues, particularly in cases involving inverted triangular Pareto fronts or strong nonlinearity. Moreover, NSGA-III often relies on simulated binary crossover, which deteriorates in problems with variable dependencies. In this study, we propose a novel multi-start optimization method that addresses these challenges. Our approach introduces a newly introduced scalarization technique, the Target Point-based Tchebycheff Distance (TPTD) method, which significantly improves coverage on problems with inverted triangular Pareto fronts. For efficient multi-start optimization, TPTD leverages a target point defined in the objective space, which plays a critical role in shaping the scalarized function. The position of the target point is adaptively determined according to the shape of the Pareto front, ensuring improvement in coverage. Furthermore, the flexibility of this scalarization allows seamless integration with powerful single-objective optimization methods, such as natural evolution strategies, to efficiently handle variable dependencies. Experimental results on benchmark problems, including those with inverted triangular Pareto fronts, demonstrate that our method outperforms NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D-DE in terms of the Hypervolume indicator. Notably, our approach achieves computational efficiency improvements of up to 474 times over these baselines.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11502">Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

                arXiv:2501.12352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.

                arXiv:2504.12561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching $\beta$=1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

">Pharmacological restoration of deficits in mitochondrial trafficking rescues aberrant axonal activity in tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative tauopathies are associated with impairments in both active axonal trafficking and presynaptic function. Deficits in axonal trafficking reduce the supply of mitochondria to presynaptic sites, where they provide a local source of energy production and calcium homeostasis, and may therefore contribute to the progressive synaptic impairment. Using in vivo two-photon imaging of mitochondrial dynamics and axonal calcium activity in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy, we show an age- and genotype-dependent decrease in mitochondrial trafficking which is correlated to disrupted presynaptic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a rescue in aberrant activity with pharmacological upregulation of axonal trafficking. The presented work reveals the disruptive influence of tau-induced trafficking impairments on presynaptic function in the early stages of the disease and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting axonal trafficking as a strategy to confer synaptic resilience in a pathogenic environment.

">Compensating Cortical Thickness for Cortical Folding-Related Variation</a></h4>

              
                Cortical thickness is a widely used biomarker of brain morphology and health, yet it is dependent on local cortical folding. Because gyral crowns are consistently thicker than sulcal fundi and cortical folds vary widely across individuals, these fluctuations introduce unmodeled nuisance variance that can obscure meaningful biological effects of interest. Previous global methods of folding compensation incompletely compensate for folding effects on cortical thickness and the spatial smoothing that is typically used to reduce these effects in the literature also markedly degrades spatial localization precision. To address these limitations, we developed a novel method for folding-compensated cortical thickness estimation that uses nonlinear local multiple regression with five folding measures to model and more completely remove folding-related variance from cortical thickness. This approach estimates what cortical thickness would have been in the absence of folding, yielding a more biologically interpretable measure of cortical architecture. We applied this new approach to data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA) and Aging Human Connectome Project (HCA), demonstrating substantial reductions in intra-areal and inter-individual variability, substantially increasing standardized effect sizes of age on cortical thickness while preserving the neurobiologically expected patterns, and avoiding the loss of spatial precision that occurs with the spatial smoothing that has traditionally been used in the literature. The method has been integrated into the HCP pipelines, facilitating its widespread use. By attenuating folding-induced variability, this technique enhances cortical thickness as a structural phenotype and may support more accurate cortical parcellation, longitudinal tracking, and biomarker discovery in brain health and disease.

">Recycling of prefrontal subspaces dynamically multiplexes information</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spiking activity in areas like prefrontal cortex (PFC) encodes information only along a small number of dimensions, a subspace of the full space of population activity patterns. PFC often uses distinct subspaces to represent incoming sensory information and to maintain it in working memory. However, it's generally assumed that a subspace carries specific information within a specific time frame. Here, in two datasets, we show that neither assumption is correct. The same subspace used during initial encoding was later reactivated during the behavioral response. We also found that subspaces ostensibly dedicated to processing sensory information were recycled to represent behavioral response information later in a trial. We further found a consistent spatial mapping between the original subspace usage and its later recycling. These results demonstrate previously unknown flexibility of PFC subspace coding, both in the deployment of subspaces across time and in their multiplexing of information. This flexibility suggests that PFC subspaces function more like "workspaces" into which different types of information can be written.

">Hippocampal-prelimbic coupling during context-dependent extinction retrieval in rats</a></h4>

              
                After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6-8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence with the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed in the IL. These results reveal that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.

">Empowering multitrait brain phenotypes GWAS</a></h4>

              
                Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are now becoming available in human genetic cohorts including thousands of participants, providing a powerful mean to decipher the genetic architecture of brain phenotypes. Univariates genome-wide association screenings (GWAS) are typically applied as a baseline approach, but there are increasing interest for multitrait approaches to both increase statistical power and uncover shared structure underlying those phenotypes. However, there are limited guidelines on how to select phenotypes to be analyzed jointly and optimize power. Here we investigated factors impacting variant discoverability of state-of-the art multitrait GWAS using 1,010 MRI-derived phenotypes measured in 32,947 participants from the UK Biobank. Our study shows that the expected gain of multitrait approaches over univariate GWAS is highly predictable. We further propose data-driven strategy to define optimize sets and compare its performances with biologically driven approaches.

">Afferent-specific modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission by acetylcholine and serotonin in the prelimbic cortex</a></h4>

              
                Acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) differentially regulate the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the mouse prelimbic (PL) cortex according to their long-distance projections. We tested for afferent- and/or target-specific modulation of glutamate release by these neuromodulators in two key afferents to the PL cortex: commissural (COM) projections from the contralateral hemisphere and projections from the mediodorsal nucleus (MDN) of the thalamus. Using an ex-vivo optogenetic approach, we mapped the connectivity of COM and MDN afferents in intratelencephalic (IT) and extratelencephalic (ET) layer 5 projection neurons and tested for afferent-selective neuromodulation of synaptic transmission. Dual whole-cell recordings in pairs of IT and ET neurons found that COM afferents monosynaptically target both IT and ET neurons, but that MDN afferents selectively target IT neurons. Both afferents exhibited similar, and target-independent, short-term synaptic plasticity (facilitation), but were differentially modulated by ACh and 5-HT. COM transmission was suppressed strongly by ACh and moderately by 5-HT, while MDN inputs to IT neurons were largely unaffected by either neuromodulator. Cholinergic suppression of COM transmission was blocked by atropine or the M4-preferring antagonist VU602841, but enhanced by the M4 positive allosteric modulator VU0467154. Serotonergic suppression of COM transmission was mildly reduced in the presence of SB216691, a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist. Chemogenetic inhibition of hM4Di-expressing COM terminals mimicked the suppressive effects of ACh and 5-HT on synaptic transmission. These data demonstrate that, while ACh and 5-HT differentially regulate IT and ET excitability, they are similarly selective in regulating COM synaptic transmission in the PL cortex.

">A highly efficient method to differentiate CGRP-expressing peptidergic nociceptors from human induced pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human cellular models of disease developed using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have enabled wide-ranging research from investigation of human disease mechanisms to phenotypic drug screens. Pain disorders such as neuropathic pain and headache remain areas of considerable unmet need and are considered high risk by pharma. Human iPSC-derived sensory neurons have already been used to accelerate translational research but the current differentiation protocols produce non-peptidergic nociceptors. We demonstrate for the first time the robust differentiation of hiPSC into peptidergic nociceptor lineage with high yield. These nociceptors express CGRP and TRPV1 whilst the non-peptidergic marker RET was completely absent. Functionally, the nociceptors show functional maturity including the expression of TTX-resistant currents and responding to TRPV1 and TRPA1 agonists. Importantly, they were able to release CGRP basally and upon stimulation by an inflammatory soup, which was inhibited upon the application of the 5-HT1B/1D/1F agonist, sumatriptan and topiramate, a migraine prophylactic drug. Overall, we report the successful generation of a novel in vitro functional peptidergic nociceptor model which will allow investigation of disease mechanisms in pain and for the development of new effective pain therapies.

">The Brain, Body, and Behavior Dataset (BBBD): Multimodal Recordings during Educational Videos</a></h4>

              
                When humans engage with video, their brain and body interact in response to sensory input. To investigate these interactions, we recorded and are releasing a dataset from N=178 participants across five experiments featuring short online educational videos. This dataset comprises approximately 110 hours of multimodal data including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, respiration, breathing rate, pupil size, electrooculogram (EOG), gaze position, saccades, blinks, fixations, head movement, and electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants viewed 3-6 videos (mean total duration: 28{+/-}5 min) to test attentional states (attentive vs. distracted), memory retention (multiple-choice questions), learning scenarios (incidental vs. intentional), and an intervention (monetary incentive). Demographic data, ADHD self-report (ASRS), and working memory assessments (digit span) were collected. Basic statistics and noteworthy effects: increased alpha power in a distracted condition, broadband EEG power increases from posterior to anterior scalp, increased blink-rate, and decreased saccade-rate in distracted and intervention conditions. All modalities are time-aligned with stimuli and standardized using BIDS, making the dataset valuable for researchers investigating attention, memory, and learning in naturalistic settings.

">Spontaneous Dynamics Predict the Effects of Targeted Intervention in Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures</a></h4>

              
                Dissociated neuronal cultures on High-Density Multi-Electrode Arrays (HD-MEAs) provide a controllable in vitro platform to systematically investigate the formation, development, and functioning of neural circuits, as well as their response to a wide array of electrical and pharmacological manipulations. Yet, this potential cannot be fully exploited without a a reliable characterization of the intricate web of causal interconnections within the culture. In this work, we present a protocol to map the network-wide impact of focal stimulation by sequentially stimulating individual sites and recording the evoked responses across the culture. We demonstrate that evoked responses are consistent and replicable across stimulation trials, allowing us to map causal links in terms of the strength of stimulus-response effects, termed Interventional Connectivity (IC). However, this time-consuming protocol may be inconvenient for experimental settings that demand rapid recordings or no perturbation, such as analyses of spontaneous plasticity. We thus investigate whether IC can be predicted from the network`s ongoing activity by comparing it to Effective Connectivity (EC) estimates derived from relatively short (10 minutes) recordings of spontaneous, unperturbed activity. We show that EC is strongly informative of IC, regardless of the specific metric used for EC inference (Transfer Entropy, Signed Cross-Correlation, or Cross-Covariance), proving that spontaneous activity can reliably reveal key aspects of the culture`s causal architecture. Our findings open the way to robust network analyses of in vitro neuronal systems, and the design of effective, targeted stimulation experiments exploiting the culture`s strongest connections or most highly connected sites.

">A combined neuroanatomy, ex vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry defined MRI mask for the human paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is an evolutionarily conserved midline thalamic structure known to contribute to arousal, interoceptive states, and motivated behaviors. Yet, a consensus anatomical definition of the human PVT across tissue-based and MRI-based approaches remains elusive, thereby limiting reliable translation between its cellular characteristics and in vivo functional connectivity. To address this challenge, we describe a histologically-informed PVT segmentation compatible with standard 3T MR imaging pipelines. We performed postmortem anatomical MRI scans on an intact whole brain and an excised thalamic block, manually segmented the PVT at high resolution using ex vivo calretinin staining and neuroanatomical landmarks, registered the resulting image-label pair to a commonly used MRI template space (Montreal Neurological Institute's MNI152), and performed a comparative reanalysis using this newly defined mask. This tissue-grounded PVT mask largely overlaps spatially with existing MRI-based PVT masks, with the exception of additional voxels posteriorly. Importantly, the functional connectivity patterns of this tissue-grounded mask are highly consistent with those previously reported. Collectively, this multimodal definition of the human PVT balances tissue-based ground truth with in vivo MRI features, providing a valuable resource for advancing translation between cellular level features identified by histology and in vivo functional connectivity at the meso/macro scale in the understudied human PVT.

">Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure induces sex-specific and time-dependent changes in affective behaviors and metabolomic profiles.</a></h4>

              
                Given the adverse effects of adolescent binge alcohol consumption in humans, the present work explores the lasting behavioral and metabolomic impacts following adolescent binge ethanol exposure. Here we determine short- and long-term changes in affective behaviors and metabolomic profiles in male and female adolescent binge ethanol-exposed mice. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) as a model of binge ethanol exposure using intermittent vapor inhalation from postnatal day (PND) 28-42. Mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tests and metabolomic analyses were conducted following short-term and long-term withdrawal from AIE exposure. Mice were tested for affective behaviors using the open field test (OFT), the light/dark test (LDT), and the tail suspension test (TST) one week following AIE exposure from PND 49-53 and again from PND 91-95. Serum samples were collected on PND 43, corresponding to 24 hours after the last exposure, fecal samples were collected during each OFT, and liver samples were collected approximately 80 days after AIE exposure for metabolomic analysis. We show modest incubation of behavioral differences in anxiety-like behavior in males after adolescent binge ethanol exposure; an effect that was absent in female mice. In contrast, metabolomic differences in male mice that were more pronounced shortly after adolescent binge ethanol exposure waned as time progressed since last exposure. Male mice appear to be more susceptible to the persistent changes in adolescent binge ethanol exposure that varies over time. It is possible that short-term metabolomic changes may predict long-term behavioral changes in affective behaviors.

">TBK1 eliminates aggregation-prone monomeric TDP-43 through the IFNβ-immunoproteasome pathway</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are genetically linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and induce cytoplasmic aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), known as TDP-43 pathology. Although TBK1 deficiency is thought to contribute to TDP-43 pathology primarily through impaired autophagy, the full spectrum of its pathological impact remains unclear. Given the multifunctional nature of TBK1, alternative pathways beyond autophagy are possibly involved in TDP-43 pathology. Here, we found that TBK1 alleviates TDP-43 pathology in neuronal cells via induction of interferon-beta (IFN{beta}), and that the IFN{beta} receptor is downregulated in spinal motor neurons from ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology. We further demonstrated that IFN{beta} induces the immunoproteasome by upregulating its subunits, thereby promoting the degradation of aggregation-prone monomeric TDP-43. Furthermore, heterozygous deletion of Tbk1 in SOD1G93A ALS model mice resulted in reduced immunoproteasome induction and increased polyubiquitinated protein accumulation in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that impairment of the TBK1-IFN{beta}-immunoproteasome axis may contribute to the development of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTD.

">Sex-specific transcriptional signatures of oxycodone persist during withdrawal and abstinence in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of heterogeneous stock rats</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major public health issue. Sleep and circadian disruptions are recognized as hallmarks of opioid addiction, often emerging during withdrawal and lasting into abstinence. However, little is known about the impact of opioids on the brain's primary circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We examined SCN transcriptomic changes in genetically diverse heterogeneous stock rats across different opioid physiological and behavioral states (naive, oxycodone intoxication, acute withdrawal, and prolonged abstinence), alongside behavioral assessments. In females, intoxication and withdrawal altered pathways related to neurotransmission, circadian rhythms, and inflammation, while in males, changes involved immune regulation, DNA damage, and metabolism. During abstinence, females showed enrichment in stress-related pathways, particularly those involved in energy metabolism and neurotransmitter function, whereas males exhibited enrichment in pathways related to cellular detoxification and oxidative stress, suggesting lasting, sex-specific effects of oxycodone administration during withdrawal and abstinence. Further, the highest proportion of sex-specific rhythmic differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during abstinence compared to other states, suggesting sex differences in gene expression in the SCN during opioid abstinence. Co-expression network analysis identified a black module linked to synaptic signaling and a red module linked to ciliary function, which were positively and negatively associated with intoxication, respectively. Black module genes were positively correlated with addiction-related behaviors during abstinence, while red module genes inversely correlated with these behaviors during intoxication, linking opioid-induced alterations in the SCN to addiction-like phenotypes. These findings highlight the SCN as a dynamic, sex-specific target of opioid exposure and suggests that SCN alterations may contribute to long-term behavioral and physiological consequences of OUD.

">Haptic Force Feedback Enhances de Novo Learning of Arm Kinematics and Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human motor system exhibits remarkable plasticity: not only can we master complex skills, but we can also learn to control artificial effectors. Here, we examine whether haptic force feedback from a simulated endpoint mass facilitates the de novo learning of novel kinematic and dynamic mappings. We investigate this using a virtual 2D planar arm controlled via a bimanual robotic manipulandum. Human participants moved two handles constrained to 1D channels, with handle positions specifying shoulder and elbow joint angles. Across two days, they performed center-out and out-back movements under two experimental conditions. On Day 1, one half of the participants practiced with a purely kinematic arm, whereas the other half received continuous haptic feedback from an endpoint mass. Although intrinsic hand movements were often initially sequential, participants rapidly adopted more coordinated control strategies, and trajectories became straighter with practice. Notably, the haptic-feedback group exhibited significantly greater improvements in virtual arm control. On Day 2, we introduced a velocity-dependent curl field to both groups. The curl field initially resulted in curved, loopy paths, but participants gradually compensated, consistent with internal-model formation. Prior exposure to haptic feedback conferred a superior capacity to adapt to the novel dynamics, evidenced by straighter trajectories and smaller directional biases throughout force-field exposure. These findings suggest haptic feedback enhances sensorimotor learning, possibly by engaging a distributed neural network of brain regions involved in motor skill acquisition and refinement.

">Harmonized Protocol for Subfield Segmentation in the Hippocampal Body on High-Resolution in vivo MRI from the Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG)</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal subfields differentially develop and age, and they vary in vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. Innovation in high-resolution imaging has accelerated clinical research on human hippocampal subfields, but substantial differences in segmentation protocols impede comparisons of results across laboratories. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international organization seeking to address this issue by developing a histologically-valid, reliable, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution T2-weighted 3 tesla MRI (http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com). Here, we report the first portion of the protocol focused on subfields in the hippocampal body; protocols for the head and tail are in development. The body protocol includes definitions of the internal boundaries between subiculum, Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-3 subfields, and dentate gyrus, in addition to the external boundaries of the hippocampus apart from surrounding white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The segmentation protocol is based on a novel histological reference data set labeled by multiple expert neuroanatomists. With broad participation of the research community, we voted on the segmentation protocol via online survey, which included detailed protocol information, feasibility testing, demonstration videos, example segmentations, and labeled histology. All boundary definitions were rated as having high clarity and reached consensus agreement by Delphi procedure. The harmonized body protocol yielded high inter- and intra-rater reliability. In the present paper we report the procedures to develop and test the protocol, as well as the detailed procedures for manual segmentation using the harmonized protocol. The harmonized protocol will significantly facilitate cross-study comparisons and provide increased insight into the structure and function of hippocampal subfields across the lifespan and in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Task-specificity of local load feedback depends on intersegmental information in an insect walking system</a></h4>

              
                Load proprioceptive feedback measured by campaniform sensilla (CS) substantially contributes to the generation of leg stepping during walking. In stick insects, the effect of load feedback on the antagonistic protractor and retractor motor neurons (MNs) reverses depending on the walking direction to support the functional stance MN pool in both stepping directions. However, this was shown in highly reduced preparations in which the stimulated leg did not perform actual stepping movements, but the effect was inferred from MN activity profiles. It is still largely unknown whether the load feedback similarly shows a direction dependent reversal in its effects on protractor and retractor activity during actual stepping of the stimulated leg. Here, we implemented load stimulation in a single-middle leg preparation and recorded protractor and retractor MN activity extracellularly during fictive forward and backward stepping. We show that CS stimulation during the stance phase prolonged stance (retractor) activity for the duration of the stimulation and induced stance (retractor) activity when applied during the swing phase in forward stepping. During backward stepping, when protractor and retractor switch phases, the same stimulation again prolonged stance (protractor) activity for the duration of the stimulation. However, it rarely induced stance (protractor) activity when applied during the swing phase. We provide evidence that this is due to the absence of signals about the stepping direction of the neighboring legs, thus highlighting the importance of intersegmental signals for task-specific processing of load proprioceptive feedback.

">Housing environment bilaterally alters transcriptomic profile in the rat hippocampal CA1 region</a></h4>

              
                Brain asymmetry is widely observed in different species. Studies on rodent hippocampi have provided morphological and physiological explanations for left-right asymmetry and have shown that the environment influences hippocampal lateralization in the CA1 region. However, how the left-right asymmetry arises, and its significance are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the transcriptome profiles of the rat hippocampus associated with lateralization and to assess the sensitivity of the bilateral CA1 region to an enriched environment. Transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq was performed on the left and right CA1 regions of male rats reared in isolated or enriched environments. Although differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were not found between left and right CA1 under either environmental condition, environment-induced DEGs were significantly detected in both left and right CA1. DEGs common to both hemispheres were also found in the environmental comparison, and immediate early genes were suggested as relevant together with gene co-expression network analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the profiles of gene expression change due to the enriched environment in the bilateral CA1 were significantly enriched in the suppressed direction in several gene sets, including those related to synaptic signaling and organization, and neuronal connection.

">Metabolic alterations in the absence of a detectable neuromuscular phenotype in novel genomically humanised SOD1A4V mice.</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) accounts for 15-30% of familial ALS and is typically autosomal dominant. How single base pair/amino acid changes in this small protein cause neurodegeneration is unknown. In North America, SOD1A4V is the most common familial ALS SOD1 mutation and results in an aggressive form of ALS. Here, we present a novel genomically humanised mouse model of SOD1A4V, in which the mouse Sod1 locus has been replaced by the human SOD1 gene, with intact genomic architecture of exons and introns, but bearing an A4V mutation. In agreement with previously reported human genomic knock-in mice, the phenotype is mild; however, transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling reveal significant dysregulation of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and lipid metabolism. These changes suggest an early bioenergetic imbalance that precedes neuromuscular impairment. Our findings support metabolic dysfunction as an early event in ALS pathogenesis. This freely available SOD1A4V model provides a valuable tool for studying ALS progression and identifying therapeutic targets for pre-symptomatic treatment.

">Striatal signaling tracks naturalistic short-term fluctuations in hunger-satiety</a></h4>

              
                The neuromodulator dopamine is integral to feeding behavior, believed to modulate food pursuit and satiety. Here, we examine how dopamine and spiny projection neurons (SPNs) signaling the nucleus accumbens change during consumption as animals transition from hunger to satiety in naturalistic feeding. Both dopamine and SPNs transiently increase during food approach; however, the magnitude of this approach-related increase diminishes across progressive pellet ingestion, reflecting short-term satiation. Fasting dissociates the regulation of meal size and frequency-- termination and initiation, respectively-- with altered dopamine corresponding to changes in meal size but not frequency. Despite substantially decreasing feeding, pharmacological satiation via a glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) agonist had no impact on dopamine signaling, suggesting that the GLP-1 agonist disengaged or decoupled dopamine from its modulatory role in food seeking.

">Identifying Explainable and Generalizable Features for MEG Decoding</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neural coding, the brain's process of transforming inputs into informative patterns of neural activity, generates complex and multiplexed neural codes which are hard to interpret. Although decoding methods have facilitated the interpretation of these codes, the specific features of neural activity that generalize across individuals, along with their precise timing, largely remain elusive. To address this gap, we investigated the potential of interpretable time-series features in magnetoencephalography (MEG) for decoding visual stimulus attributes (spatial frequency and orientation) and their generalizability across individuals. We extracted a comprehensive set of highly informative features from 18 subjects engaged in a visual task and performed a time-resolved decoding analysis. Our findings revealed that particular features, especially those capturing rapid changes in neural activity within the first 200 milliseconds of stimulus presentation, yielded high decoding accuracy. Notably, these early, transient features exhibited robust cross-subject generalizability, suggesting a shared neural coding mechanism during the initial processing of visual inputs. Furthermore, these features outperformed previously successful electroencephalography (EEG) wavelet features when applied to MEG data. While within-subject decoding demonstrated sustained above-chance performance, cross-subject generalization diminished after the initial 200 milliseconds, indicating more individualized processing at later stages. Our results underscore the importance of systematic, data-driven evaluation of neural signals for elucidating neural codes and for developing more transparent and generalizable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems that capitalize on these reliable neural signatures.

">Isomerized Aβ in the brain can distinguish the status of amyloidosis in the Alzheimer's Disease spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular amyloid plaques, the pathognomonic hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are also observed in cognitively unimpaired subjects in the preclinical stages. Progressive accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) as plaques and perivascular deposits occur two decades prior to clinical onset, making A{beta} a long-lived peptide. To characterize the amyloid plaques biochemically, both the A{beta} load as well the post-translational modifications (PTMs) could serve as markers for distinguishing the pre-clinical stage compared to later prodromal and clinical stages of AD. Recently, we described the presence of extensive isomerization of the A{beta} N-terminus in AD post-mortem brains that are significantly increased compared to the age-matched non-AD control brains with A{beta} aggregates in the frontal cortex. In this report, we used targeted mass spectrometry to conduct a quantitative analysis of the most common PTMs associated with A{beta} pyroglutamation, citrullination, N-terminal truncation (A{beta}4-x), C-terminal truncation (A{beta}42 and A{beta}40), and isomerization of aspartic acid residues (Asp-1 and Asp-7) in postmortem human brain tissue from pathologically negative (no A{beta} plaques) controls, controls with A{beta} plaques, Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without A{beta} accumulation/plaques and symptomatic AD. The AD cases contained statistically significant amounts of Asp-1and Asp-7 isomerized A{beta}1-15 (~ 90 %) compared to controls (preclinical AD) and PD brains with fibrillar A{beta} aggregates/deposits. We find that ratio of isomerized N-terminus A{beta} (A{beta}1-15) species in the brain detergent soluble pool differentiates older fibrillar A{beta} deposits in symptomatic AD brain compared to A{beta} deposits detected in preclinical AD and PD. Citrullinated A{beta}3pglu-15 was increased only in symptomatic AD, highlighting this A{beta} PTM is a unique feature of parenchymal plaques in advanced AD. Our results have implications for early therapeutic targeting of these modified species as well potential for better biofluid biomarker development for drug efficacy monitoring.

">Adaptations in common synaptic inputs to spinal motor neurons during grasping versus a less functional hand task</a></h4>

              
                Previous evidence suggests that shared synaptic inputs across spinal motor neurons play a key role in coordinating multiple muscles during hand movements, reducing control complexity. In this study, we investigated how the nervous system modulates these common synaptic inputs during a functionally relevant grip (grasping) compared to less functionally relevant hand tasks. Seventeen participants performed three different tasks: simultaneous four-finger flexion without thumb involvement (four-finger flexion), thumb flexion, and simultaneous flexion of both fingers and thumb (grasping). For each task, subjects sustained isometric contractions at 5% and 15% of maximal voluntary contraction, while high-density surface electromyograms (HDsEMG) were recorded from the superficial extrinsic flexor muscles of the hand. Motor unit spike trains were decomposed from HDsEMG and tracked across tasks, and their mean discharge rate was calculated. Coherence between motor units was quantified within the delta, alpha, and beta bands to estimate common synaptic oscillations. At both force levels, the mean discharge rate decreased during grasping compared to four-finger flexion but increased during grasping compared to thumb flexion. Additionally, the area under the curve of coherence within the alpha band decreased by ~20% during grasping compared to the four-finger flexion task, with no significant delta or beta bands changes. These reductions in alpha band coherence were reflected in force oscillations, showing decreased force-neural drive coupling within the alpha band and increased force steadiness during grasping compared to four-finger flexion. Our findings suggest that a functionally relevant and frequently used grip involves distinct neural control mechanisms that ultimately enhance force control.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Infants’ electroencephalography (EEG) dominant rhythm oscillates between 6 and 9 Hz. The desynchronization of this rhythm from baseline to the processing of visual stimuli is used as an index to better understand the development of visual attention. However, development trajectories of desynchronization remain underexplored. Additionally, it is unclear whether development of desynchronization is sensitive to task demands or if it reflects broader developmental changes. To investigate these questions, EEG data were collected from infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months while they passively viewed a fixation cross followed by 10-s trials of a female face or novel object tracked down the screen. Dominant rhythm desynchronization was calculated by subtracting power during the fixation period from power during each task condition. The results revealed significant desynchronization in response to faces at occipital electrodes for all age groups. The magnitude of the desynchronization also increased from 6 to 9 to 12 months of age in response to faces over right occipital electrodes. No significant desynchronization was observed for object stimuli. These findings suggest that dominant rhythm desynchronization develops across infancy and is sensitive to stimulus type. The increased desynchronization for faces compared to objects highlights infants’ general preference for faces relative to objects.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Working memory training (WMT) has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Brain network connectivity, particularly as measured by the participation coefficient (PC), offers a valuable framework for elucidating these neural changes. This study investigated the effects of WMT on brain network connectivity, utilizing PC as a primary assessment of network integration and segregation. The relationship between WMT-induced changes in PC and the density of specific neurotransmitter receptors was examined. Seventy-six healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a WMT group or a control group. After 8 wks of training, the WMT group exhibited significant cognitive improvements, especially in near and far transfer tasks. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by specific changes in brain connectivity, including a reduction in PC within the sensorimotor network and node-specific alterations in the left prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital-parietal junction, and parietal operculum. Moreover, changes in PC were significantly correlated with the density of dopamine D2 receptors, mu-opioid receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. These findings enhance our understanding of how WMT influences cognitive function and brain network connectivity, highlighting the potential for targeting specific networks and neurotransmitter systems in cognitive training interventions.</span>

                Arekar et al. demonstrate that the liver peptide hepcidin holds therapeutic promises for treating invasive fungal infections by Candida albicans. A hepcidin agonist improves infection outcome because it protects from renal pathology by diminishing iron bioavailability in kidneys.

">Effects of stimulus modality and response type on oddball stimulus discrimination using polarity-considered EEG microstate labeling</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require effective feature extraction and dimensionality reduction from multidimensional brain signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate analysis offers a fast and noise-resistant approach by classifying the states of brain signals into spatial distribution patterns (templates). Each EEG segment was assigned the template with the highest spatial correlation, reducing the information to a one-dimensional representation. However, prior BCI studies have often ignored the polarity of spatial distributions in these templates. Incorporating polarity during labeling may enhance classification performance. This study investigated the effectiveness of polarity-considered microstate labeling for classifying infrequent stimuli in an auditory-visual oddball task with implications for BCI applications. Method: EEG recordings were analyzed using polarity-considered microstate labeling to classify infrequent stimuli. This study examined the effects of stimulus modality (auditory or visual), modality conditions (unimodal: stimulus and response in the same modality; cross-modal: stimulus and response in different modalities), and response type (key-press task vs. mental counting task) on classification accuracy. Machine learning models were used for classification, including support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, CatBoost and K-means methods. Results: Polarity-considered labeling outperformed the non-polarity approach, especially in decision-tree-based models (20.1% improvement in the key-press task and 22.2% improvement in the mental counting task). A significant interaction was observed between stimulus modality and response type, with the highest accuracy achieved when the infrequent stimuli in the key-press task involved cross-modal visual information. Conclusion: The findings suggest that polarity-considered microstate labeling enhances EEG-based classification. This approach has potential applications in BCI, such as in P300 spellers using cross-modal auditory-visual stimuli.

">Combined Angiographic, Structural and Perfusion Radial Imaging using Arterial Spin Labeling</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To develop a non-contrast MRI method for the simultaneous acquisition of time-resolved 3D angiographic, perfusion and multi-contrast T1-weighted structural brain images in a single six-minute acquisition. Methods: The proposed Combined Angiographic, Structural and Perfusion Radial Imaging using Arterial Spin Labeling (CASPRIA) pulse sequence uses pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) to label inflowing blood, an inversion pulse to provide background suppression and T1-weighted contrast, and a continuous 3D golden ratio spoiled gradient echo readout. Label-control subtraction isolates the blood signal and can be flexibly reconstructed at high/low spatiotemporal resolution for angiography/perfusion imaging. The mean signal retains the static tissue, allowing T1-weighted structural images to be reconstructed at different effective inversion times. CASPRIA was compared with conventional time-of-flight (TOF) angiography, 3D-gradient and spin echo (3D-GRASE) PCASL perfusion imaging and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) structural imaging (10 minutes total) in healthy volunteers. Results: CASPRIA gave improved distal vessel visibility and fewer artefacts than TOF angiography, whilst also providing dynamic information, with blood transit time and dispersion maps. CASPRIA perfusion images were comparable to 3D-GRASE data, but without through-slice blurring or artefacts in inferior brain regions. Comparable quantitative cerebral blood flow maps were produced, with CASPRIA being significantly more repeatable. Structural CASPRIA images were comparable to MP-RAGE, but also yielded a range of T1-weighted contrasts and allowed quantitative T1 maps to be estimated. Conclusion: CASPRIA is an efficient single acquisition to provide intrinsically co-registered quantitative information about brain blood flow and structure that has considerable advantages over conventional methods.

">Integrating simulated and experimental data to identify mitochondrial bioenergetic defects in Parkinson's Disease models</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial bioenergetics are vital for ATP production and are associated with several diseases, including Parkinsons Disease. Here, we simulated a computational model of mitochondrial ATP production to interrogate mitochondrial bioenergetics under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and provide a data resource that can be used to interpret mitochondrial bioenergetics experiments. We first characterised the impact of several common respiratory chain impairments on experimentally-observable bioenergetic parameters. We then established an analysis pipeline to integrate simulations with experimental data and predict the molecular defects underlying experimental bioenergetic phenotypes. We applied the pipeline to data from Parkinsons Disease models. We verified that the impaired bioenergetic profile previously measured in Parkin knockout neurons can be explained by increased mitochondrial uncoupling. We then generated primary cortical neurons from a Pink1 KO mouse model of Parkinsons, and measured reduced OCR capacity and increased resistance to Complex III inhibition. Here, our pipeline predicted that multiple respiratory chain impairments are required to explain this bioenergetic phenotype. Finally, we provide all simulated data as a user-friendly resource that can be used to interpret mitochondrial bioenergetics experiments, predict underlying molecular defects, and inform experimental design.

">Electrophysiological recordings reveal photoreceptor coupling in the dorsal rim areas of honeybee and bumblebee eyes</a></h4>

              
                Many insects rely on skylight polarization patterns to navigate their habitats. To perform this vital task, most insect species have evolved specialized ommatidia in the dorsal rim area (DRA) of their compound eyes that are adapted to detect linearly polarized light in large patches of sky. In this study, we conducted electrophysiological recordings of honeybee (Apis mellifera) and bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) photoreceptors in the DRA and other regions of the compound eye to map their receptive fields. For both species, we report novel evidence for photoreceptor coupling, i.e., spatial summation, present in the retinal layer of the DRA. We explore spatial summation as a possible, eye-region-specific mechanism to increase the effective size of DRA ommatidia receptive fields; a crucial functional feature of the polarization compass.

">Isolation of Neural Stem Cells Using Platelet Derived Growth Factor C</a></h4>

              
                Here, we show that Platelet-Derived Growth Factor C (PDGFC) supports the isolation of neural stem cells (NSCs) from the murine subventricular zone (SVZ) and maintains them in quiescent and slowly proliferating states. We also show that NSCs isolated using PDGFC can be induced to proliferate rapidly when switched to media supplemented with Epidermal Growth Factor and Fibroblast Growth Factor (EGF/FGF), the gold standard growth condition for NSCs. Although patterns of gene expression in NSCs isolated in PDGFC or in EGF/FGF are similar, a comparative analysis of quiescence genes reveals that NSCs in PDGFC are more like SVZ tissue than are NSCs maintained in EGF/FGF. In addition, NSCs isolated using PDGFC transition to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) when FGF is added to PDGFC and have an expression profile indistinguishable from OPCs that are isolated traditionally using PDGFA/FGF.

">Automatic Individual Cortical Parcellation for the Human Connectome Project</a></h4>

              
                The original Human Connectome Project multimodal cortical parcellation (HCP_MMP1.0) used MRI-derived local features and long-distance functional connectivity measures to define a multimodal parcellation at the group level, accompanied by an automated areal classifier, to create subject-specific mappings of the human cerebral cortex. These mappings, referred to as individual (cortex) parcellations, aim to capture individual variability in areal organization by learning from both structural and functional data. However, a strict supervised learning approach using the group parcellation as labels would have no incentive to learn individual differences that registration is unable to reconcile (e.g., atypical 55b topologies). Furthermore, there are many types of resting state network (RSN) feature maps, and it is unclear which type would most accurately or effectively classify areas, or even what should be the primary criteria for evaluating classification performance. Here, we introduce an Areal Recognition Ensemble with Nested Approach (ARENA) classifier that learns from uncertain labels, using a novel application of weakly supervised learning to this type of problem. Additionally, in comparing multiple candidate RSN decompositions, temporal ICA and PROFUMO maps outperformed the original spatial ICA-based approach based on objective criteria. With these refinements, the ensemble classifier achieved a reliable individual variability score of 8380, an average areal detection rate of 97.8%, and test-retest reproducibility of 73.3%, outperforming a retrained version of the original Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model (whose reliable individual variability score was 3128, average areal detection rate was 97.2%, and test-retest reproducibility was 71.6% on the same dataset). Furthermore, the ARENA classifier demonstrated stronger generalization for all three measures when applied to task fMRI data that were not part of the training dataset. Using the refined classifier and leveraging all 1071 HCP-Young Adult subjects, we identified new types of atypical organization of language-related area 55b. Here we provide the fully data-driven HCP_MMP1.0_1071_MPM (Maximum Probability Map) group parcellation and a summary of area 55b organization in both hemispheres. Our automated individual parcellation pipeline powered by the novel ARENA classifier is now integrated into the HCP pipelines, offering a user-friendly tool for the neuroimaging community.

">Inter-brain similarity and connectivity based on EEG hyperscanning during patient-acupuncturist interactions</a></h4>

              
                The study of patient-clinician relationships is a vital branch of interpersonal interaction research. Acupuncture attaches great importance to positive patient-clinician interactions; thus, it serves as a typical example of patient-clinician interaction research. Based on electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning, this study explored inter-brain similarity based on spatial correlations between two brains as well as inter-brain connectivity of different regions through different frequency bands. Regarding inter-brain similarity, both acupuncture and sham acupuncture significantly decreased spatial correlation during certain sessions during acupuncture. Regarding inter-brain connectivity, acupuncture enhanced not only the connectivity of the beta frequency band in the right temporoparietal regions but also the connectivity of the fast-ripple frequency band in the right and left temporoparietal regions. These results suggest that inter-brain similarity should be emphasized in patient-clinician relationship research. Moreover, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) potentially play an important role in inter-brain connectivity in addition to the classical EEG low-frequency bands.

">The Impact of Visual Perturbations on Balance Control during Walking</a></h4>

              
                Visual perturbations may lead to a perception of self-motion and affect balance control. We studied effects of different visual perturbations in 16 healthy young participants walking on a treadmill, by assessing foot placement and center of mass (CoM) movement. Three different visual perturbations were applied: fixating a stationary target at eye level while the background moved to the right (MB), tracking a target moving rightward over a stationary background with head rotation (MT-HR), and tracking the moving target with eye movement only (MT-EM). Linear models were fit to the kinematics data to predict foot placement from CoM state at mid-swing. Over the whole trial, MT-HR and MT-EM caused an increase in step width variability, CoM position variability and foot placement residual error. During visual perturbation epochs specifically, in MB, a left deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed from the start of background movement. In MT-HR and MT-EM, a right deviation of foot and CoM trajectories was observed only after the target had stopped moving. Contrary to our expectations, foot placement errors did not coincide with subsequent CoM deviations in the opposite direction. An obvious change in frontal plane trunk orientation was found only in MT-HR. While all visual perturbations affected control of the CoM trajectory in the frontal plane, these effects appeared caused by effects on heading as well as balance control. Head rotation appears to additionally disturb balance through a coupling with trunk orientation.

                <p>Despite its central role in the proper functioning of the motor system, sensation has been less studied than motor outputs in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring sensation non-invasively: while motor outputs have easily observable consequences, sensation is inherently an internal variable of the motor system. In this study, we investigated how well participants can sense relevant sensory stimuli that induce locomotor adaptation. We addressed this question with a split-belt treadmill, which moves the legs at different speeds. We used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm with multiple repetitions of various speed differences considering the probabilistic nature of perceptual responses. We found that the participants correctly identified a speed difference of 49.7 mm/s in 75% of the trials when walking at 1.05 m/s (i.e., 4.7% Weber Fraction). To gain insight into the perceptual process in walking, we applied a drift-diffusion model (DDM) relating the participants&rsquo; identification of speed difference (i.e., stimulus identification) and their response time during walking. The implemented DDM was able to predict participants&rsquo; stimulus identification for all speed differences by simply using the recorded reaction times (RTs) to fit a single set of model parameters. Taken together, our results indicate that individuals can accurately identify smaller speed differences than previously reported and that participants&rsquo; stimulus perception follows the evidence accumulation process outlined by drift diffusion models, conventionally used for short-latency, static sensory tasks, rather than long-latency, and motor tasks such as walking.</p>

                <p>by Neda Shahidi, Fernando Rozenblit, Mohammad H. Khani, Helene M. Schreyer, Matthias Mietsch, Dario A. Protti, Tim Gollisch</p>

The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron’s spiking responses and shapes the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models for predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depends on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and perform best for different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                <p>by Di Wu, Qi Ouyang, Hongli Wang, Youdong Mao</p>

Despite high-resolution structural studies on the USP14-proteasome-substrate complexes, time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results on USP14-regulated allostery of the 26S proteasome are still very limited and a quantitative understanding of substrate degradation dynamics remains elusive. In this study, we propose a mean field model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for USP14 regulated substrate degradation in 26S proteasome. The kinetic model incorporates recent cryo-EM findings on the allostery of 26S proteasome and generates results in good agreement with time-resolved experimental observations. The model elucidates that USP14 typically reduces the substrate degradation rate and reveals the functional dependence of this rate on the concentrations of substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the substrate for different ATP concentrations is predicted. When multiple substrates are present, the model suggests that substrates that are easier to insert into the OB-ring and disengage from the proteasome, or less likely to undergo deubiquitination would be more favored to be degraded by the USP14-bound proteasome. The mean field model proposed here quantitatively considers the process of proteasomal substrate degradation from the perspective of chemical kinetics, and provides a quantitative framework to decode the dynamic interplay between USP14 and the proteasome.

                <p>by Romani Osbourne, Kelly M. Thayer</p>

The link between p53 tumor suppressive functions and organismal lifespan is multifaceted. Its DNA-repair mechanism is longevity-enhancing while its role in cellular senescence pathways induces pro-aging phenotypes. To understand how p53 may regulate organismal lifespan, cross-species genotype-phenotype (GP) studies of the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) have been used to assess the correlation of amino acid changes to lifespan. Amino acid changes in non-DNA-binding regions such as the transactivation (TAD), proline-rich (PRD), regulatory (REG), and tetramerization (TET) are largely unexplored. In addition, existing GP correlation tools such as SigniSite do not account for phylogenetic relationships between aligned sequences in correlating genotypic differences to phenotypes such as lifespan. To identify phylogenetically significant, longevity-correlated residues in full-length p53 alignments, we developed a Python- and R-based workflow, Relative Evolutionary Scoring (RES). While RES-predicted longevity-associated residues (RPLARs) are concentrated primarily in the DBD, the PRD, TET, and REG domains also house RPLARs. While yeast functional assay enrichment reveals that RPLARs may be dispensable for p53-mediated transactivation, PEPPI and Rosetta-based protein-protein interaction prediction suggests a role for RPLARs in p53 stability and interaction interfaces of tumor suppressive protein-protein complexes. With experimental validation of the RPLARs’ roles in p53 stability, transactivity, and involvement in senescence-regulatory pathways, we can gain crucial insights into mechanisms underlying dysregulated tumor suppression and accelerated aging.

The growing interest in the role of the gut virome in human health and disease, has led to several recent large-scale viral catalogue projects mining human gut metagenomes each using varied computational tools and quality control criteria. Importantly, there has been to date no consistent comparison of these catalogues’ quality, diversity, and overlap. In this project, we therefore systematically surveyed nine previously published human gut viral catalogues. While these catalogues collectively screened >40,000 human fecal metagenomes, 82% of the recovered 345,613 viral sequences were unique to one catalogue, highlighting limited redundancy between the ressources and suggesting the need for an aggregated resource bringing these viral sequences together. We further expanded these viral catalogues by mining 7,867 infant gut metagenomes from 12 large-scale infant studies collected in 9 different countries. From these datasets, we constructed the Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC), a unified modular resource containing 1,018,941 dereplicated viral sequences (449,859 species-level vOTUs). Using computational inference tools, annotations were obtained for each vOTU representative sequence quality, viral taxonomy, predicted viral lifestyle, and putative host. This project aims to facilitate the reuse of previously published viral catalogues by the research community and follows a modular framework to enable future expansions as novel data becomes available.

Sensory thresholds enable animals to regulate their behavioral responses to environmental threats. Despite the importance of sensory thresholds for animal behavior and human health, we do not yet have a full appreciation of the underlying molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms. The larval zebrafish acoustic startle response provides a powerful system to identify molecular mechanisms underlying establishment of sensory thresholds and plasticity of thresholds through mechanisms like habituation. Using this system, we identify Cadherin-16 as a previously undescribed regulator of sensory gating. We demonstrate that Cadherin-16 regulates sensory thresholds via an endocrine organ, the corpuscle of Stannius (CS), which is essential in zebrafish for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. We further show that Cadherin-16 regulates whole-body calcium and ultimately behavior through the hormone Stanniocalcin 1l (Stc1l), and the IGF-regulatory metalloprotease, Papp-aa. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the CS through ablation experiments that reveal its role in promoting normal acoustic sensory gating. Together, our results uncover a previously undescribed brain non-autonomous pathway for the regulation of behavior and underscore Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as a critical process underlying sensory gating <i>in vivo.</i>

Agricultural diseases are a major threat to sustainable food production. Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus <i>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</i> (Bgt). We sampled Bgt across two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions. We identified a single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, <i>AvrPm17</i>, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple <i>AvrPm17</i> haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade <i>Pm17</i> resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>T</i>ubulin <i>P</i>olymerization <i>P</i>romoting <i>P</i>roteins (TPPPs) are highly conserved across species but remain poorly understood. There are three <i>TPPP</i> genes in humans, with only one homologous <i>TPPP</i> gene in invertebrates, such as <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. The human TPPP (TPPP1/p25/p25α) is enriched in the brain and shares sequence similarities with the invertebrate TPPPs. TPPP/p25 associates with microtubules and plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics, bundling, and polymerization, thereby stabilizing the microtubular network. This is essential for cytoskeletal organization and proper functioning of neurons and glial cells, including axonal growth, regeneration, migration, trafficking, synapse formation, and myelination of axons. However, studies have also uncovered that besides its cytoplasmic/microtubular localization, TPPP/p25 is present in other subcellular compartments, including the mitochondria and nucleus, underscoring the presence of additional novel functions. At the molecular level, TPPP/p25 is predicted to exist as an intrinsically disordered protein and is implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and related disorders and Multiple Sclerosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of TPPP/p25, highlighting its evolutionary conservation, cellular and subcellular localization, established and emerging functions in the nervous system, interacting partners, potential clinical relevance to human neurological disorders, and conclude with unresolved questions and future areas of study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1089/v3?src=rss">Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly, several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy, notably, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as zebularine. However, a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity, i.e., the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable, thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance, treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene, leading to unintended adverse effect. Methods Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample, we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning. Results We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at eight doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1µM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available, our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore, a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model. Conclusions Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v2?src=rss">Relationship between the perception of oral health and the quality of life of hospital staff [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1378/v2?src=rss">Decoding Investor Sentiments in the Indian Stock Market: A Structural Equation Modelling Approach [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This research examines how psychological and social biases affect individual investors’ investing decisions. Investor sentiment significantly influences financial markets, frequently causing stock prices to deviate from their intrinsic values. In rising economies such as India, where retail investors are significantly affected by psychological factors, comprehending these attitudes is crucial. Methods This study analyses data from a comprehensive questionnaire that was conducted throughout the nation and included 552 retail investors. The investigation employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the elements that influence the decision-making of individuals who invest in the Indian stock market. Findings The research offers insight on the influence that investor attitude has on investment decision-making as well as the factors that precede it. The study demonstrates that investors make financial decisions based on sentiment. In addition to assessing the efficacy of the Indian financial market, this study sought to ascertain the rationality of investors’ choices by exploring the factors that influence their decision-making process. Conclusion The outcome of the study shows that information seeking, anchoring, herding, representativeness, and overconfidence all have a big impact on investors. Moreover, the study has proven investors’ irrationality and stock market inefficiency. The findings may be employed to further examine the trading practices of international investors and encourage further study in the field of behavioural finance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-473/v1?src=rss">Overcoming Data Barriers: Digital Inclusion and Equitable Public Services for People with Disabilities in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ensuring equitable access to public services for people with disabilities remains a persistent challenge in digital governance. Despite advancements in data governance frameworks, disparities in accessibility continue to exclude marginalized populations. While government-led digital initiatives f ocus on efficiency and compliance, their impact on vulnerable groups remains underexplored. This study examines the causal factors influencing audit data governance in Thailand’s public sector, with a particular focus on the contrasting perspectives between government officials, who are responsible for delivering public services, and people with disabilities, who rely on these services. Methods This research employs Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MG-SEM) to analyze survey responses from 711 participants, including policymakers, policy implementers, auditors, and people with disabilities (specifically individuals with visual and physical impairments). The study utilizes a quantitative approach, ensuring that all analyses are based on structured survey data. Key constructs examined include public service delivery for people with disabilities (measured by perception of public service, enablers for access to data, citizen-oriented policy, and fair & efficient administrative procedures), data-driven culture, which ultimately influence audit data governance. Results The findings reveal significant disparities in how data governance is perceived. Government officials emphasize efficiency, compliance, and regulatory adherence, whereas people with disabilities prioritize accessibility, usability, and inclusivity in digital public services. These contrasting perspectives highlight systemic barriers that hinder the equitable implementation of digital governance frameworks, exacerbating the digital divide in public service accessibility. Conclusions To address these challenges, the study proposes targeted policy interventions, including the integration of AI-driven auditing mechanisms, the establishment of universal digital accessibility standards, and the implementation of participatory governance strategies. These recommendations provide valuable insights for policymakers, auditors, and public administrators aiming to foster transparency, trust, and inclusivity in digital public services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1299/v2?src=rss">A causality investigation into stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in the Indian stock market [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.70041?af=R">A Novel H2S Donor Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Seizures by Inhibiting the C3‐C3aR Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Both astrocytes and microglia are activated in the epileptic brain. There is an interaction between them through the complement 3 (C3)-C3a receptor (C3aR) pathway, which plays a detrimental role in seizures. Our self-developed novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor has been found to have anti-seizure effects. However, its mechanism remains to be explored. In the present study, we showed that the novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor can inhibit the activation of astrocytes and microglia and their interaction through C3-C3aR signaling, which contributed to alleviating microglial neuroinflammation and seizures. In LPS-treated astrocytes and pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor reduced C3 production in astrocytes and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-10 in microglia. The H<sub>2</sub>S donor also reduced the EEG amplitude of hippocampal epileptic waves and relieved seizures in epileptic mice. These effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor can be reversed by intranasal C3 treatment and mimicked by a C3aR antagonist. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the anti-seizure effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor. Therefore, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor has the potential to be used as a candidate for antiepileptic drugs.</p>

                The appropriate and rapid encoding of stimuli bearing a negative valence enables behaviors that are essential for survival. Recent advances in neuroscience using rodents as a model system highlight the relevance of cell type-specific neuronal activities in diverse brain networks for the encoding of aversion, as well as their importance for subsequent behavioral strategies. Within these networks, neuromodulators influence cell excitability, adjust fast synaptic neurotransmission, and affect plasticity, ultimately modulating behaviors. In this review we first discuss contemporary findings leveraging the use of cutting-edge neurotechnologies to define aversion-related neural circuits. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the release of neuromodulators and neuropeptides upon exposure to aversive stimuli are described within defined brain circuits. Together, these mechanistic insights update the present neural framework through which aversion drives motivated behaviors.

                Eubanks et al. found that gene expression networks that are specific for brain regions that develop high degrees of alpha-synuclein pathology carry an increased frequency of rare risk variants in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This dysregulates alpha-synuclein homeostasis, in particular its liquid-liquid phase separation and association with lipids in inclusions.

                Feeding is a fundamental requirement for the survival of host and gut microbiota. Here, Pan et al. discovered how gut microbiota influences feeding behavior through KYNA. During fasting, increased KYNA levels stimulate food intake by inhibiting vagal afferent nerves and activating AgRP neurons, demonstrating a mechanism of microbiota-mediated appetite regulation.

                Aguilar-Gómez et al. find evidence of evolutionary adaptation with potential relevance to breath-hold diving in the Haenyeo divers of Korea. Genetic variants under selection in this population may help mitigate the physiological strain of repeated diving during pregnancy. Additionally, long-term training appears to enhance the diving response through pronounced bradycardia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101420">Aberration correction in long GRIN lens-based microendoscopes for extended field-of-view two-photon imaging in deep brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of 2P microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length &lt;4.1 mm (Antonini et al., 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length &gt;6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 µm). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high-precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100918">Temporal dynamics analysis reveals that concurrent working memory load eliminates the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping</a></h4>

              
                Concurrent verbal working memory task can eliminate the color-word Stroop effect. Previous research, based on specific and limited resources, suggested that the disappearance of the conflict effect was due to the memory information preempting the resources for distractors. However, it remains unclear which particular stage of Stroop conflict processing is influenced by working memory loads. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, time-frequency analyses, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPAs), and representational similarity analyses (RSAs) were applied to provide an in-depth investigation of the aforementioned issue. Subjects were required to complete the single task (the classical manual color-word Stroop task) and the dual task (the Sternberg working memory task combined with the Stroop task), respectively. Behaviorally, the results indicated that the Stroop effect was eliminated in the dual-task condition. The EEG results showed that the concurrent working memory task did not modulate the P1, N450, and alpha bands. However, it modulated the sustained potential (SP), late theta (740–820 ms), and beta (920–1040 ms) power, showing no difference between congruent and incongruent trials in the dual-task condition but significant difference in the single-task condition. Importantly, the RSA results revealed that the neural activation pattern of the late theta was similar to the response interaction pattern. Together, these findings implied that the concurrent working memory task eliminated the Stroop effect through disrupting stimulus-response mapping.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98033">Semantical and geometrical protein encoding toward enhanced bioactivity and thermostability</a></h4>

              
                Protein engineering is a pivotal aspect of synthetic biology, involving the modification of amino acids within existing protein sequences to achieve novel or enhanced functionalities and physical properties. Accurate prediction of protein variant effects requires a thorough understanding of protein sequence, structure, and function. Deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in guiding protein modification for improved functionality. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on protein sequences, which face challenges in efficiently encoding the geometric aspects of amino acids’ local environment and often fall short in capturing crucial details related to protein folding stability, internal molecular interactions, and bio-functions. Furthermore, there lacks a fundamental evaluation for developed methods in predicting protein thermostability, although it is a key physical property that is frequently investigated in practice. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel pre-training framework that integrates sequential and geometric encoders for protein primary and tertiary structures. This framework guides mutation directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates variant effects based on their fitness to perform specific functions. We assess the proposed approach using three benchmarks comprising over 300 deep mutational scanning assays. The prediction results showcase exceptional performance across extensive experiments compared to other zero-shot learning methods, all while maintaining a minimal cost in terms of trainable parameters. This study not only proposes an effective framework for more accurate and comprehensive predictions to facilitate efficient protein engineering, but also enhances the in silico assessment system for future deep learning models to better align with empirical requirements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100870">The neuropeptide sulfakinin is a peripheral regulator of insect behavioral switch between mating and foraging</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral strategies for foraging and reproduction in the oriental fruit fly (<i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>) are alternative options for resource allocation and are controlled by neuropeptides. Here, we show that the behavioral switch between foraging and reproduction is associated with changes in antennal sensitivity. Starved flies became more sensitive to food odors while suppressing their response to opposite-sex pheromones. The gene encoding sulfakinin receptor 1 (<i>SkR1</i>) was significantly upregulated in the antennae of starved flies, so we tested the behavioral phenotypes of null mutants for the genes encoding the receptor (<i>skr1</i><sup>–/–</sup>) and its ligand sulfakinin (<i>sk</i><sup>–/–</sup>). In both knockout lines, the antennal responses shifted to mating mode even when flies were starved. This suggests that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1 promotes foraging while suppressing mating. Further analysis of the mutant flies revealed that sets of odorant receptor (OR) genes were differentially expressed. Functional characterization of the differentially expressed ORs suggested that sulfakinin directly suppresses the expression of ORs that respond to opposite-sex hormones while enhancing the expression of ORs that detect food volatiles. We conclude that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1, modulating OR expressions and leading to altered antenna sensitivities, is an important component in starvation-dependent behavioral change.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103413">Disruption of the novel nested gene Aff3ir mediates disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Disturbed shear stress-induced endothelial atherogenic responses are pivotal in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, contributing to the uneven distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. This study investigates the role of <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i>, a novel nested gene variant, in disturbed flow-induced endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> expression, we demonstrate that <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in <i>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. RNA sequencing revealed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (<i>Irf5</i>), a key regulator of inflammatory processes, mediates inflammatory responses associated with <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficiency. <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> interacts with <i>Irf5</i>, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the <i>Irf5</i>-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, <i>Irf5</i> knockdown in <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. These findings elucidate a novel role for <i>Aff3ir-ORF2</i> in mitigating endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis by acting as an inhibitor of <i>Irf5</i>, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90309">Interdependence of plasma membrane nanoscale dynamics of a kinase and its cognate substrate underlies Arabidopsis response to viral infection</a></h4>

              
                Plant viruses represent a risk to agricultural production and as only a few treatments exist, it is urgent to identify resistance mechanisms and factors. In plant immunity, plasma membrane (PM)-localized proteins play an essential role in sensing the extracellular threat presented by bacteria, fungi, or herbivores. Viruses are intracellular pathogens and as such the role of the plant PM in detection and resistance against viruses is often overlooked. We investigated the role of the partially PM-bound Calcium-dependent protein kinase 3 (CPK3) in viral infection and we discovered that it displayed a specific ability to hamper viral propagation over CPK isoforms that are involved in immune response to extracellular pathogens. More and more evidence supports that the lateral organization of PM proteins and lipids underlies signal transduction in plants. We showed here that CPK3 diffusion in the PM is reduced upon activation as well as upon viral infection and that such immobilization depended on its substrate, Remorin (REM1.2), a scaffold protein. Furthermore, we discovered that the viral infection induced a CPK3-dependent increase of REM1.2 PM diffusion. Such interdependence was also observable regarding viral propagation. This study unveils a complex relationship between a kinase and its substrate that contrasts with the commonly described co-stabilisation upon activation while it proposes a PM-based mechanism involved in decreased sensitivity to viral infection in plants.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The organization of the cingulate cortex has been the subject of intensive studies, concluding to its central role in motor control, cognition, and arousal. One of the key anatomical pathways through which the cingulate cortex influences behavior is its efferent connection to the locus coeruleus (LC). This brainstem region is responsible for noradrenaline (NA) release and is critical for various cognitive and behavioral functions. However, the specific impact of cingulate subregions on the LC-NA system remains unexplored. This study investigated how the different cingulate cortex areas affect LC-NA activity by measuring pupil-evoked responses (PERs) as an index of LC-NA activity. Using intra-cortical stimulation across the eight cingulate areas in rats, we found that anterior cingulate cortex and midcingulate cortex subregions evoked rare autonomic responses but significant pupil dilations whose amplitude increased along the caudo-rostral and dorso-ventral axes. By using the DSP-4, a neurotoxin-selective ablation of the LC-NA system, we suppressed PER and confirmed the role of LC-NA activity in this response. The differential influence of cortical areas on the PER demonstrates that each subregion of the rat cingulate cortex has the potential to differentially activate the LC-NA system, suggesting a clear parcellation of the rodent cingulate cortex, likely corresponding to functional specialization.</span>

Endomembrane breaching is a crucial strategy employed by intracellular pathogens enclosed within vacuoles to access the nutrient-rich cytosol for intracellular replication. While bacteria use various mechanisms to compromise host membranes, the specific processes and factors involved are often unknown. <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, a major human pathogen, accesses the cytosol relying on the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) and secreted effectors. Using in-cell correlative light and electron microscopy, we tracked the sequential steps of <i>Shigella</i> host cell entry. Moreover, we captured the T3SS, which projects a needle from the bacterial surface, in the process of puncturing holes in the vacuolar membrane. This initial puncture ensures disruption of the vacuole. Together this introduces the concept of mechanoporation via a bacterial secretion system as a crucial process for bacterial pathogen-induced membrane damage.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are limited population-based data regarding the prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and associated risks of mortality and incident cerebrovascular events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient claims from 2008 to 2022 from a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. CAA and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were identified using validated International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. We ascertained CAA from October 1, 2015 through 2022, and used data from 2008 through September 30, 2015 to ascertain comorbidities including prevalent stroke. We used Cox regression to examine the association of CAA with subsequent death and incident stroke subtypes after adjustment for demographics, vascular risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,920,312 Medicare beneficiaries in our sample, 2,161 (11.3 per 10,000) had a diagnosis of CAA. In adjusted Cox regression analysis, there was an association between CAA and subsequent mortality (HR 4.9; 95% CI 4.6–5.2). Among 1,872,474 patients without prevalent stroke, including 900 of the CAA patients, there was a significant association between CAA and an increased risk of any stroke (HR 8.0; 95% CI 6.7–9.6), ischemic stroke (HR 4.6; 95% CI 3.6–6.0), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR 26.9; 95% CI 20.3–35.6), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR 21.6; 95% CI 12.2–38.1). After a diagnosis of CAA, absolute risks of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were broadly similar.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a large, nationwide cohort of Medicare beneficiaries, the prevalence of clinically diagnosed CAA was approximately 11 per 10,000. CAA was associated with an increased risk of mortality and incident stroke, both hemorrhagic and ischemic. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 5 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 94.26%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least five days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

Methods This observational analytic study, conducted in 2019, aimed to examine the relationship between xylene concentration, xylene RQ, and liver function in industrial workers in Surabaya, especially in shoe industries. The chi-square method was utilized for data analysis. To ensure the validity and reliability of the study results, air and blood sampling procedures were implemented. Air sampling was conducted to measure xylene concentrations in the workplace environment, while blood samples were collected from workers to assess Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels. The study was conducted in five regions in Surabaya, namely Kalijudan, Ketintang, Jemursari, AUP, and Romokalisari. Participants were between 16 and 65 years old, provided informed consent, had no history of medically diagnosed liver disease, and submitted complete and accurate questionnaire responses. Confounding factors (physical activity, nutrition, smoking) were controlled through participant questionnaires and statistical adjustments. The population includes a total of 90 workers with 77 of them taken as samples using the accidental sampling method. Results The results show that there is a relationship between xylene concentration and Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = 0,65) and there is no relationship between xylene concentrations and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) levels (p> 0.05); (r = -0,12). There was no relationship between RQ and SGOT levels (p> 0.05) and there was no relationship between RQ and SGPT levels (p> 0.05). However, from the calculation of the prevalence ratio, workers with unsafe RQ (RQ>1) have a 7.09x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGOT levels and a 1.06x greater chance of experiencing damage to SGPT levels. Conclusions Xylene exposure (concentration & RQ) affects liver enzyme levels (SGOT/SGPT) in workers. Industries should consider providing nutritious food to aid xylene removal and stricter safety policies are needed. This study highlights the importance of a holistic approach to worker health and safety when dealing with hazardous chemicals.

                Background Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in critical care. Despite extensive preclinical research on sepsis pathophysiology, the development of effective therapies has been largely unsuccessful. Key obstacles include limited construct validity of animal models, insufficient methodological rigor and the lack of collaborative frameworks akin to clinical trials. These issues plague not only sepsis research, but preclinical research in general. The National Preclinical Sepsis Platform (NPSP), an interdisciplinary network under Sepsis Canada, addresses these challenges in sepsis research through multilaboratory, randomized, controlled preclinical studies. NPSP-01 will establish baseline conditions for future investigations using an acute fecal-induced peritonitis model of sepsis. Methods This randomized, controlled study will evaluate the effect of standard sepsis therapy in a mouse model of sepsis across six centres. Interlaboratory variability and the interaction of biological sex on outcomes will also be examined. C57BL/6 mice of both sexes will be randomized into sham (healthy control) + treatment, sepsis, or sepsis + treatment groups. Sepsis will be induced via intraperitoneal injection of fecal slurry, while sham mice will receive vehicle control. Antibiotics and fluids will be administered to treatment groups at 4 hours post-induction, and mice with be euthanized at 8 hours post-induction. The primary outcome is plasma interleukin-6 levels. Secondary outcomes include biological (blood gas and chemistry, white blood cell count, bacterial load), clinical (body weight, core temperature, sepsis score, mortality as measured by surrogate humane endpoints), and feasibility measures. Conclusions NPSP-01 will be the first multilaboratory study of sepsis and represents a shift in preclinical critical illness research, mirroring the rigor of clinical multicenter trials. By addressing procedural standardization, interlaboratory variability, and sex-based differences, this study aims to enhance the reliability and translational relevance of preclinical findings. The outcomes of NPSP-01 will establish foundational data for future investigations and provide a roadmap for rigorous collaborative preclinical studies to accelerate the evaluation of novel sepsis therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00413-9?rss=yes">Regulatory T cells suppress GM-CSF-producing T helper cells via IL-2 modulation to restrain immunopathology</a></h4>

              
                Costa-Pereira et al. uncover a key role for regulatory T (Treg) cells in suppressing GM-CSF-producing T helper (TH) cells via IL-2 modulation, thereby preventing fatal immunopathology. Their study highlights how GM-CSF orchestrates phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction in the absence of Treg cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00391-2?rss=yes">Universal fibroblasts across tissues can differentiate into niche cells for hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Higaki et al. provided direct evidence that universal fibroblasts from the lung, the colon, and muscle differentiated into functional HSC niche cells, known as BM CAR cells. This is the first demonstration of the ability of universal fibroblasts to generate tissue-specific specialized fibroblasts.
