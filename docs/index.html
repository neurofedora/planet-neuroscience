              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neural basis of prosocial behavior</a></h4>

              
                The ability to behave in ways that benefit other individuals’ well-being is among the most celebrated human characteristics crucial for social cohesiveness. Across mammalian species, animals display various forms of prosocial behaviors – comforting, helping, and resource sharing – to support others’ emotions, goals, and/or material needs. In this review, we provide a cross-species view of the behavioral manifestations, proximate and ultimate drives, and neural mechanisms of prosocial behaviors. We summarize key findings from recent studies in humans and rodents that have shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying different processes essential for prosocial interactions, from perception and empathic sharing of others’ states to prosocial decisions and actions.

Material and Methods: Four CBS patients CBS(+), three patients with visual loss but no visual hallucinations CBS(-) and 15 healthy individuals (HS) undergo resting state fMRI recordings and their resting state data is analyzed for Default Mode Network (DMN) changes through dual regression analysis. Cognitive functions of the participants were also evaluated through Mini Mental State Examination and University of Miami - Parkinson's Disease Hallucination Questionnaire (um-PDHQ). Results: Although we found no difference in Default Mode Networks between CBS(-) and CBS(+), and between the CBS(-) and HC groups, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to the HC group especially in visual heteromodal association centers (bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, bilateral lingual gyrus, occipital pole, right medial temporal cortex, right temporo-occipital cortex) when left angular gyrus was selected as ROI. Similarly, we detected decreased connectivity in CBS(+) compared to HC in right medial frontal gyrus, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and right angular gyrus when selected right superior frontal gyrus as ROI. In contrast, increased connectivity was detected in CBS +compared to HC, in bilateral occipital poles, bilateral occipital fusiform gyrus, bilateral intracalcarine cortex, right lingual gyrus and precuneus regions when left medial temporal gyrus was selected as ROI. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a combined mechanism in CBS related to increased internal created images caused by decreased visual external input causing visual hallucinations as well as impaired frontotemporal resource tracking system that together impair cognitive processing.

                An animals nervous system recognizes visual features regardless of where the visual feature is located. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable location invariant feature detection are not fully understood, particularly when visual feature information contributed by each eye needs to be resolved. Here we investigate directional invariance of looming responses in descending neurons (DN) of Drosophila melanogaster. We find multiple looming responsive DN integrate looming information across both eyes, even though their dendrites are unilateral. One DN in particular, the giant fibers (GF), generates invariant looming responses across approach directions. We confirm visual information propagates to the GF from the contralateral eye through an as of yet unidentified pathway and demonstrate the absence of this pathway alters GF responses to looming stimuli from the ipsilateral eye. Our data highlight a role for bilateral visual integration in generating consistent escape responses that are robust across a wide range of stimulus locations and parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential disruptions in population coding along the dorsal-ventral axis of CA1 in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Aβ pathology</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of behavioral alterations including memory loss as well as cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. While there is growing evidence that cellular and molecular pathologies, such as the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques may contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology can give rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis for these diverse behavioral presentations is that amyloid beta plaques; accumulation has differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the diverse neurophysiological properties and connections within and between the neurons in these different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in the dorsal and ventral CA1 regions of the hippocampus, areas that are known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in both APP/PS1 animals, a mouse model of Amyloid pathology, and age-matched C57BL/6 controls. Although we found similar levels of Amyloid pathology in the two subregions, populations of neurons in dorsal and ventral CA1 in APP/PS1 mice showed distinct signatures of disrupted neuronal activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dorsal CA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in the APP/PS1 mice. However, in ventral CA1, the opposite findings were observed; pair-wise correlations and entropy was increased in APP/PS1 mice relative to C57BL/6 controls. When we attempted to connect the microscopic features of population activity (the correlations) with the macroscopic features of the population code (the entropy) using a pairwise Ising model, we found that the models' performance decreased in predicting dorsal CA1 activity but increased in predicting vCA1 activity in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to the C57BL/6 animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that amyloid beta pathology exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions. Our results suggest that the diverse behavioral deficits associated with AD and the cellular pathology that arises from amyloid accumulation may be mechanistically linked by studying the dynamics of neural activity within these diverse hippocampal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switches to rhythmic brain activity lead to a plasticity-induced reset in synaptic weights</a></h4>

              
                Brain function relies on the ability to quickly process incoming information while being capable of forming memories of past relevant events through the formation of novel synaptic connections. Synaptic connections are functionally strengthened or weakened to form new memories through synaptic plasticity rules that strongly rely on neuronal rhythmic activities. Brain information processing, on the other hand, is shaped by fluctuations in these neuronal rhythmic activities, each defining distinctive brain states, which poses the question of how such fluctuations in brain states affect the outcome of memory formation. This question is particularly relevant in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, wakefulness to sleep transitions being characterized by large modifications in global neuronal activity. By combining computational models of neuronal activity switches and plasticity rules, we show that switches to rhythmic brain activity reminiscent of sleep lead to a reset in synaptic weights towards a basal value. This reset is shown to occur both in phenomenological and biophysical models of synaptic plasticity, and to be robust to neuronal and synaptic variability and network heterogeneity. Analytical analyses further show that the mechanisms of the synaptic reset are rooted in the endogenous nature of the sleep-like rhythmic activity. This sleep-dependent reset in synaptic weights permits regularizing synaptic connections during sleep, which could be a key component of sleep homeostasis and has the potential to play a central role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

                Early deafness leads to the reorganization of large-scale brain networks, involving and extending beyond the auditory system. Body-centered visuomotor transformation is impaired after early auditory deprivation, associated with a hyper-crosstalk between the task-critical frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default-mode network (DMN). It remains to be elucidated, how the reorganized functional connectivity between the auditory system, the FPN, and the DMN contributes to the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness. In this fMRI study, we asked early deaf participants and hearing controls to judge the spatial location of a visual target, either about the middle-sagittal line of their own body (the egocentric task) or another background object (the allocentric task). The bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the deaf group exhibited cross-modal reorganization, with generally enhanced neural activity during the visual tasks, compared to hearing controls. Moreover, the STG showed significantly increased functional connectivity with both the FPN and the DMN in the deaf group compared to hearing controls, specifically during the egocentric task. The increased STG-FPN and STG-DMN coupling, however, showed antagonistic effects on the egocentric performance of the deaf participants. The increased STG-FPN connectivity was associated with improved (i.e., a beneficial role) while the increased STG-DMN with deteriorated (i.e., a detrimental role) egocentric performance in the deaf participants. No such effect was observed in hearing controls. Therefore, the auditory cortex is reorganized to functionally resemble the FPN in the deaf brain, representing compensatory neuroplasticity to mitigate the impaired visuomotor transformation after early deafness.

                Perivascular spaces (PVS) are important highways for fluid and solute transport in the brain enabling efficient waste clearance during sleep. Using two-photon imaging of naturally sleeping mice we demonstrate sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics - slow, large-amplitude oscillations in NREM, a reduction in REM and an enlargement upon awakening at the end of a sleep cycle. By biomechanical modeling we demonstrate that these sleep cycle-dependent PVS dynamics drive fluid flow and solute transport.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early-life stress lastingly impacts microglial transcriptome and function under basal and immune-challenged conditions</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) leads to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including depression later in life. Neuroinflammatory processes have been implicated in ELS-induced negative health outcomes, but how ELS impacts microglia, the main tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system, is unknown. Here, we determined the effects of ELS induced by limited bedding and nesting material during the first week of life (postnatal days [P]2 - 9) on microglial i) morphology; ii) hippocampal gene expression; and iii) synaptosome phagocytic capacity in male pups (P9) and adult (P200) mice. The hippocampus of ELS-exposed adult mice displayed altered proportions of morphological subtypes of microglia, as well as microglial transcriptomic changes related to the tumor necrosis factor response and protein ubiquitination. ELS exposure leads to distinct gene expression profiles during microglial development from P9 to P200 and in response to an LPS challenge at P200. Functionally, synaptosomes from ELS-exposed mice were phagocytosed less by age-matched microglia. At P200, but not P9, ELS microglia showed reduced synaptosome phagocytic capacity when compared to CTRL microglia. Lastly, we confirmed the ELS-induced increased expression of the phagocytosis-related gene GAS6 that we observed in mice, in the dentate gyrus of individuals with a history of child abuse using in situ hybridization. These findings reveal persistent effects of ELS on microglial function and suggest that altered microglial phagocytic capacity is a key contributor to ELS-induced phenotypes.

                The large heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a major drawback for the development of therapies. Here, we apply consensus-subtyping strategies based on functional connectivity patterns to a population of N=657 quality-assured autistic subjects. We found two major subtypes (each divided hierarchically into several minor subtypes): Subtype 1 exhibited hypoconnectivity (less average connectivity than typically developing controls) and subtype 2, hyperconnectivity. The two subtypes did not differ in structural imaging metrics in any of the regions analyzed (64 cortical and 14 subcortical), nor in any of the behavioral scores (including Intelligence Quotient, ADI and ADOS). Finally, we used the Allen Human Brain Atlas of gene transcription to show that subtype 2, corresponding with about 42% of all patients, had significant enrichment (after multiple comparisons correction) to excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance, a leading reported mechanism in the developmental pathophysiology of ASD. Altogether, our results support a link between E/I imbalance and brain hyperconnectivity in ASD, an association that does not exist in hypoconnected autistic subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immunological contributions to age-dependent variations in behavioural responses to cutaneous inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Systemic responses to immune challenge are immature at birth. However exposure to experimental inflammogens are able to produce an immunologic response which is characterised by swelling and oedema but, unlike in adults, does not result in sensory hypersensitivity. We sought to investigate whether the lack of nociceptive hypersensitivity was as a result of altered hemapoietic immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation and/or differences in the cytokine and chemokine profile released by tissue invading cells. Postnatal (day of birth) and young adult (40-days old) Sprague- Dawley rats were used. Inflammation was induced by s.c. injection of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) unilaterally into the one hind paw. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured before and after injection (2-168hrs). In adults a significant hyperalgesia was evoked which was absent in neonates. Immunohistochemical analysis of invading immune cells present in the perfusion fixed skin showed that although total cell numbers in the paw were the same in both age groups, neonates recruited more cells positive for both cell surface markers CD68 and Mannose-receptor (MR) whereas adults recruited significantly more cells positive for MR alone. There were no differences in neutrophil recruitment (as measured with H&E staining). TaqMan qPCR demonstrated that the temporal profile of cytokine production in the skin differed between ages with neonates responding faster than adults and that neonates produced significantly more IL-1b and IL-27 then adults who expressed significantly more IL-6 and IL-10. This study illustrates that in neonates the cell recruitment and cytokine profiles are markedly different to those seen in adults; this may in part explain why behavioural responses to inflammation are suppressed relative to adults.

                Nociceptors play an essential role in both acute pain and chronic pain conditions. and have recently been classified into distinct subsets using single-cell transcriptional profiling. In this study, we examined protein levels in dorsal root ganglia using DIA Mass-spectrometry technologies with NaV1.8Cre+/-; ROSA26-flox-stop-flox-DTA (Diphtheria toxin fragment A) mutant mice (NaV1.8Cre-DTA), in which NaV1.8-expressing neurons (mainly nociceptors) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were ablated. The results show that 353 transcripts and 78 proteins, including nociceptor-specific sodium channels NaV1.8 (Scn10a) and NaV1.9 (Scn11a), were specifically expressed in nociceptors of DRG. A comparative analysis revealed that about 40% of nociceptor-specific proteins are shared within the nociceptor-specific transcript dataset. Scatter plots show that the proteome and transcriptome datasets in nociceptors have a moderate correlation (r = 0.4825), indicating the existence of post-transcriptional and post-translational gene regulation in nociceptors. This combined profiling study provides a unique resource for sensory studies, especially for pain research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Percolation Theory Identifies Critical Constraints on White Matter Tract Development</a></h4>

              
                To better understand fundamental constraints on the global structural organization of the brain, we apply percolation theory as a quantitative measure of global communication across a network. The largest present sub-network across which all sets of regions are able to communicate defines a giant cluster. By novel analytic solution, we prove that if constructed tracts are constrained to emanate from those regions already in the giant cluster, a giant cluster grows smoothly without requiring a critical point. The predicted structure is highly consistent with brain data, among human diffusion MRI across adults (UK Biobank, N=19,380), adolescents (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, N=15,593) and neonates (Developing Human Connectome Project, N=758), as well as mouse viral tracing (Allen Institute). This suggests a fundamental mechanism for neurodevelopment in which the earliest tracts also become the longest and densest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG frequency tagging evidence of intact social interaction recognition in adults with autism</a></h4>

              
                To explain the social difficulties in autism, a large amount of research has been conducted on the neural correlates of social perception. However, this research has mostly used basic social stimuli (e.g. eyes, faces, hands, single agent), not resembling the complexity of what we encounter in our daily social lives, and as such, the situations people with autism experience difficulties in. A more complex stimulus that we do come across often and is also highly relevant for social functioning is that of third-party social interactions. Here, we investigated if individuals with and without autism process third-party social interactions differently. More specifically, we measured neural responses to social scenes depicting either social interaction or not with an electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency tagging task and compared these responses between adults with and without autism (N = 61). The results revealed an enhanced response to social scenes with interaction, replicating previous findings in a neurotypical sample (Oomen et al., 2022). Crucially, this effect was found in both groups with no difference between them. This suggest that social interaction recognition is not anomalous in adults with autism and cannot explain the social difficulties adults with autism experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adrenal sympathetic nerve mediated the anti-inflammatory effect of electroacupuncture at ST25 acupoint on a rat model of sepsis</a></h4>

              
                Acupuncture plays a vital anti-inflammatory action on sepsis through activating autonomic nerve anti-inflammatory pathways, such as sympathoadrenal medullary pathway, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to explore the optimum parameter of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation in regulating sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and evaluate EA anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis. To explore the optimum parameter of EA at homosegmental acupoint on adrenal sympathetic activity, the left adrenal sympathetic nerve firing rate evoked by different intensities of single shock electrical stimulation (ES) at ST25 in healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were evaluated by in vivo electrophysiological recording, and the levels of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites were also examined using mass spectrometry. To verify the role of EA at ST25 in sepsis, the rat was given intraperitoneal injection lipopolysaccharide to induce sepsis model, and survival rate, clinical score, and the level of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta}, and IL-10 were evaluated after EA application. We observed that 3 mA is the optimal intensity on activating adrenal sympathetic nerve, which significantly elevated the level of NE in the peripheral blood. For LPS-treated rats, EA at the ST25 apparently increased the survival rate and improved the clinical score compared to the control group. Furthermore, 3 mA EA at ST25 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1{beta} and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 compared to the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated group. Overall, these data suggest that 3 mA is the optimal EA intensity at ST25 to activate the sympathoadrenal medullary pathway and exert an anti-inflammatory effect on sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The activity of deep cortical layers characterizes thecomplexity of brain responses during wakefulnessfollowing electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the complexity of the brain is closely related to its state of consciousness. The perturbational complexity index (PCI) has been used in humans and rodents to distinguish conscious from unconscious states based on the global cortical responses (recorded by electroencephalography; EEG) to local cortical stimulation (CS). However, it has been unclear how different cortical layers respond to CS and contribute to the resulting intra- and inter-areal cortical communication and PCI. A detailed investigation of these local dynamics is needed to understand the basis for PCI. We hypothesized that the complexity level of global cortical responses (PCI) corresponds to variations in layer-specific activity and connectivity patterns. We investigated global cortical dynamics and layer specific activity in mice, combining cortical electrical stimulation, global EEG, and local multi-electrode, laminar recordings from layers 1-6 in somatosensory cortex, during wakefulness and general anesthesia (sevoflurane). We found that transition from wake to sevoflurane anesthesia correlated with a drop in global and local PCI values (complexity). This was accompanied by a local decrease in neural firing rate, spike-field coherence, and long-range functional connectivity specific to deep layers (L5, L6). Our results suggest that deep cortical layers are mechanistically important for changes in PCI, and thereby for variations in the states of consciousness.

                Cortical neurons exhibit temporally irregular spiking patterns and heterogeneous firing rates. These features arise in model circuits operating in a 'fluctuation-driven regime', in which fluctuations in membrane potentials emerge from the network dynamics. However, it is still unclear whether the cortex operates in this regime. We evaluated the fluctuation-driven hypothesis by analyzing spiking and sub-threshold membrane potentials of neurons in the sensory and frontal cortex recorded during a decision-making task. Standard fluctuation-driven models account for spiking statistics but fail to capture the heterogeneity in sub-threshold activity. We address this issue by effectively incorporating dendritic conductances into the standard models. Our model suggests that the frontal cortex operates in a fluctuation-driven regime. In contrast, excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are not fluctuation-driven; they spike in response to occasional synchronous inputs. Our work reveals fundamental differences between cortical areas, suggesting that they operate in different dynamical regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ComBat Harmonization: Empirical Bayes versus Fully Bayes Approaches</a></h4>

              
                Studying small effects or subtle neuroanatomical variation requires large-scale sample size data. As a result, combining neuroimaging data from multiple datasets is necessary. Variation in acquisition protocols, magnetic field strength, scanner build, and many other non-biologically related factors can introduce undesirable bias into studies. Hence, harmonization is required to remove the bias-inducing factors from the data. ComBat, introduced by (Johnson et al., 2007), is one of the most common methods applied to features from structural images. ComBat models the data using a hierarchical Bayesian model and uses the empirical Bayes approach to infer the distribution of the unknown factors. The empirical Bayes harmonization method is computationally efficient and provides valid point estimates. However, it tends to underestimate uncertainty. This paper investigates a new approach, fully Bayesian ComBat, where Monte Carlo Sampling is used for statistical inference. Our experiments show that our new fully Bayesian approach offers more accurate harmonization, unconstrained posterior distributions, and representative uncertainty quantification at the expense of higher computation costs for the inference. This fully Bayesian approach generates a rich posterior distribution, which is also useful for generating simulated imaging features for improving classifier performance in a limited data setting. We show the generative capacity of our model for augmenting and improving the detection of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Posterior distributions for harmonized imaging measures can also be used for brain-wide uncertainty comparison and more principled downstream statistical analysis. Code for our new fully Bayesian ComBat extension is available at https://github.com/batmanlab/BayesComBat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information theoretic evidence for layer- and frequency-specific changes in cortical information processing under anesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Nature relies on highly distributed computation for the processing of information in nervous systems across the entire animal kingdom. Such distributed computation can be more easily understood if decomposed into the three elementary components of information processing, i.e. storage, transfer and modification, and rigorous information theoretic measures for these components exist. However, the distributed computation is often also linked to neural dynamics exhibiting distinct rhythms. Thus, it would be beneficial to associate the above components of information processing with distinct rhythmic processes where possible. Here we focus on the storage of information in neural dynamics and introduce a novel spectrally-resolved measure of active information storage (AIS). Drawing on intracortical recordings of neural activity under anesthesia before and after loss of consciousness (LOC) we show that anesthesia-related modulation of AIS is highly specific to different frequency bands and that these frequency-specific effects differ across cortical layers and brain regions. We found that in the high/low gamma band the effects of anesthesia result in AIS modulation only in the supergranular layers, while in the alpha/beta band the strongest decrease in AIS can be seen at infragranular layers. Finally, we show that the increase of spectral power at multiple frequencies, in particular at alpha and delta bands in frontal areas, that is often observed during LOC ('anteriorization') also impacts local information processing - but in a frequency specific way: Increases in isoflurane concentration induced a decrease in AIS in the alpha frequencies, while they increased AIS in the delta frequency range < 2Hz. Thus, the analysis of spectrally-resolved AIS provides valuable additional insights into changes in cortical information processing under anaesthesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual-level Functional ConnectivityPredicts Cognitive Control Efficiency</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive control (CC) is a vital component of cognition associated with problem-solving in everyday life. Many neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions have deficits associated with CC. CC is composed of multiple behaviors including switching, inhibiting, and updating. The fronto-parietal control network B (FPCN-B), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and the dorsal default-mode network (dorsal-DMN) have been associated with switching and inhibiting behaviors. However, our understanding of how these brain regions interact to bring about CC behaviors is still unclear. In the current study, participants performed two in-scanner tasks that required switching and inhibiting. We then used a series of support vector regression (SVR) models containing individually-estimated functional connectivity between the networks of interest derived during tasks and at rest to predict inhibition and switching behaviors in individual subjects. We observed that the combination of between-network connectivity from these individually estimated functional networks predicted accurate and timely inhibition and switching behaviors in individuals. We also observed that the relationships between canonical task-positive and task-negative networks predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. Finally, we observed a functional dissociation between the FPCN-A and FPCN-B during rest, and task performance predicted inhibiting and switching behaviors. These results suggest that individually estimated networks can predict individual CC behaviors, that between-network functional connectivity estimated within individuals is vital to understanding how CC arises, and that the fractionation of the FPCN and the DMN may be associated with different behaviors than their canonically accepted behaviors.

                Bodily rhythms such as respiration are increasingly acknowledged to modulate neural oscillations underlying human action, perception, and cognition. Conversely, the link between respiration and aperiodic brain activity - a non-oscillatory reflection of excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance - has remained unstudied. Aiming to disentangle potential respiration-related dynamics of periodic and aperiodic activity, we applied novel algorithms of time-resolved parameter estimation to resting-state M/EEG data from two recording sites (N = 78). Our findings highlight the role of respiration as a physiological influence on brain signalling. We provide first evidence that fluctuations of aperiodic brain activity (1/f slope) are phase-locked to the respiratory cycle which strongly suggests that spontaneous state shifts of excitation-inhibition balance are at least partly influenced by peripheral bodily signals. Moreover, differential temporal dynamics in their coupling to non-oscillatory and oscillatory activity point towards a functional distinction in the way each component is related to respiration.

                Neuropeptide release from dense-core vesicles in Caenorhabditis elegans is promoted by UNC-31, ortholog of the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Loss of UNC-31 causes multiple phenotypes in C. elegans including reduced motility, retention of late-stage eggs and reduction in evoked synaptic release. However, the ability to analyze UNC-31 function over discrete timescales and in specific neurons is lacking. Here, we generated and validated a tool to enable UNC-31 expression and spatiotemporal functional analysis. We show that endogenously tagged UNC-31 is expressed in major ganglia and nerve cords from late-embryonic stages through to adult. Using the auxin-inducible degradation system, we depleted UNC-31 post-embryonically from the nervous system and revealed defects in egg-laying, locomotion and vesicle release that were comparable to unc-31 null mutant animals. In addition, we found that depleting UNC-31 specifically from the BAG sensory neurons causes increased intestinal fat storage, highlighting the spatial sensitivity of this system. Together, this protein degradation tool may be used to facilitate studies of neuropeptide function at precise cellular and temporal scales.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract motor neurons. Previous studies showed that adenosine-mediated neuromodulation is disturbed in ALS and that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a neuroprotective function in ALS mouse models. We evaluated how adenosine (A1R and A2AR) and VEGF (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) system markers are altered in the cortex and spinal cord of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice. We then assessed if/how chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with a widely consumed adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, modulates VEGF system and/or the levels of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), known to be under control of A2AR. We found out decreases in A1R and increases in A2AR levels even before disease onset. Concerning the VEGF system, we detected increases of VEGFB and VEGFR-2 levels in the spinal cord at pre-symptomatic stage, which reverses at the symptomatic stage, and decreases of VEGFA levels in the cortex, in very late disease states. Chronic treatment with caffeine rescued cortical A1R levels in SOD1G93A mice, bringing them to control levels, while rendering VEGF signaling nearly unaffected. In contrast, BDNF levels were significantly affected in SOD1G93A mice treated with caffeine, being decreased in the cortex and increased in spinal the cord. Altogether, these findings suggest an early dysfunction of the adenosinergic system in ALS and highlights the possibility that the negative influence of caffeine previously reported in ALS animal models results from interference with BDNF rather than with the VEGF signaling molecules.

                The ability to associate reward-predicting stimuli with adaptive behavior is frequently attributed to the prefrontal cortex, but the stimulus-specificity, spatial distribution, and stability of neural cue-reward associations are unresolved. We trained headfixed mice on an olfactory Pavlovian conditioning task and measured the coding properties of individual neurons across space (prefrontal, olfactory, and motor cortices) and time (multiple days). Neurons encoding cues and licks were most common in olfactory and motor cortex, respectively. By classifying cue-encoding neurons according to their responses to the six odor cues, we unexpectedly found value coding, including coding of trial-by-trial reward history, in all regions we sampled. We further found that prefrontal cue and lick codes were preserved across days. Our results demonstrate that individual prefrontal neurons stably encode components of cue-reward learning within a larger spatial gradient of coding properties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifiability analysis and noninvasive online estimation of the first-order neural activation dynamics in the brain with transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurons demonstrate very distinct nonlinear activation dynamics, influenced by the neuron type, morphology, ion channel expression, and various other factors. The measurement of the activation dynamics can identify the neural target of stimulation and detect deviations, e.g., for diagnosis. This paper describes a tool for closed-loop sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the activation dynamics through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The proposed SPE method operates in real time, selects ideal stimulus parameters, detects and processes the response, and concurrently estimates the input-output (IO) curve and the first-order approximation of the activated neural target. Objective: To develop a SPE method to concurrently estimate the first-order activation dynamics and IO curve in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) TMS. Method: First, identifiability of the integrated model of the first-order neural activation dynamics and IO curve is assessed, demonstrating that at least two IO curves need to be acquired with different pulse widths. Then, a two-stage SPE method is proposed. It estimates the IO curve by using Fisher information matrix optimization in the first stage and subsequently estimates the membrane time constant as well as the coupling gain in the second stage. The procedure continues in a sequential manner until a stopping rule is satisfied. Results: The results of 73 simulation cases confirm the satisfactory estimation of the membrane time constant and coupling gain with average absolute relative errors (AREs) of 6.2% and 5.3%, respectively, with an average of 344 pulses (172 pulses for each IO curve or pulse width). The method estimates the IO curves' lower and upper plateaus, mid-point, and slope with average AREs of 0.2%, 0.7%, 0.9%, and 14.5%, respectively. Conclusions: SPE of the activation dynamics requires acquiring at least two IO curves with different pulse widths, which needs a TMS device with adjustable pulse duration. Significance: The proposed SPE method enhances the cTMS functionality, which can contribute novel insights in TMS studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Covert shifts of attention towards the visual periphery induce pupil dilation</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have suggested that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral as compared to the (para)foveal visual field, i.e., with increasing attentional breadth. This finding is crucial because it matches the theoretical prediction that (para)foveal vision benefits more from the visual acuity provided by small pupils than peripheral vision does. However, no study has investigated this question while controlling for all possible confounds (e.g., task difficulty). Throughout three experiments (N=100) we tested whether pupil size increases with increasing attentional breadth, and if this effect depends on the shape of attention, that is, whether attention is broadly (Annulus Attention) or narrowly (Spotlight Attention) distributed. We found that pupil size increases with covert shifts of attention to the peripheral visual field, i.e., increasing attentional breadth, with no clear difference between the two shapes of attention. We further found a correlation with performance, suggesting a functional benefit of the link between attentional breadth and pupil size. Finally, we propose that cognitively driven pupil dilation is not merely a convenient marker of activity in brain areas such as the Locus Coeruleus, but rather is an adaptive response that reflects an emphasis on peripheral vision over foveal vision.

	<p>Background: Despite significant research progress surrounding precision medicine in psychiatry, there has been little tangible impact upon real-world clinical care. Objective: To identify barriers and facilitators affecting the real-world implementation of precision psychiatry. Method: A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature search of primary research studies, conducted in the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and OpenGrey databases. We included a qualitative data synthesis structured according to the &amp;amp;lsquo;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&amp;amp;rsquo; (CFIR) key constructs. Results: Of 93,886 records screened, 28 studies were suitable for inclusion. The included studies reported 38 barriers and facilitators attributed to the CFIR constructs. Commonly reported barriers included: potential psychological harm to the service user (n = 11), cost and time investments (n = 9), potential economic and occupational harm to the service user (n = 8), poor accuracy and utility of the model (n = 8), and poor perceived competence in precision medicine amongst staff (n = 7). The most highly reported facilitator was the availability of adequate competence and skills training for staff (n = 7). Conclusions: Psychiatry faces widespread challenges in the implementation of precision medicine methods. Innovative solutions are required at the level of the individual and the wider system to fulfil the translational gap and impact real-world care.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging and promising therapeutic approach for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The most common DBS targets include the anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). This protocol aims to explore the efficacy and safety of the combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS for treatment-refractory OCD. Methods: We will recruit 64 patients with refractory OCD from six centers, randomly allocate them to active and sham-stimulation groups through a three-month double-blind phase, then enter a three-month open-label phase. In the open-label stage, both groups experience real stimulation. Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be the efficacy and safety of combined ALIC- and NAcc-DBS, determined by treatment response rate between the active and sham-stimulation groups at the double-blind stage and spontaneously reported adverse events. The secondary outcomes are comparisons of change in Y&amp;amp;ndash;BOCS, CGI, HAMD, and HAMA scores at the third and sixth months compared to baseline between the active and sham-control groups, as well as the scores of the third month minus the sixth month between the two groups.</p>

	<p>Repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (rNMS) for pediatric headache disorders is feasible, safe, and alleviates headache symptoms. This study assesses muscular effects and factors affecting response to rNMS. A retrospective chart review included children with headaches receiving six rNMS sessions targeting the upper trapezius muscles. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were measured before and after rNMS, and at 3-month follow-up (FU). Mean headache frequency, duration, and intensity within the last 3 months were documented. In 20 patients (14.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.7 years), PPT significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) sustaining until FU. PPT changes significantly differed between primary headache and post-traumatic headache (PTH) (p = 0.019&amp;amp;ndash;0.026). Change in headache frequency was significantly higher in patients with than without neck pain (p = 0.032). A total of 60% of patients with neck pain responded to rNMS (&amp;amp;ge;25%), while 20% of patients without neck pain responded (p = 0.048). 60% of patients receiving rNMS twice a week were responders, while 33% of patients receiving rNMS less or more frequently responded to treatment, respectively. Alleviation of muscular hyperalgesia was demonstrated sustaining for 3 months, which was emphasized in PTH. The rNMS sessions may positively modulate headache symptoms regardless of headache diagnosis. Patients with neck pain profit explicitly well. Two rNMS sessions per week led to the highest reduction in headache frequency.</p>

	<p>Eye movement abnormalities in association with cognitive and emotional deficits have been described in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Eye-Tracking (ET) techniques could therefore enhance cognitive interventions by contingently providing feedback to patients. Since no consensus has been reached thus far on this approach, this study aimed at systematically reviewing the current evidence. This review was performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. Records were searched for in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (1990&amp;amp;ndash;2021) through the following string: (&amp;amp;lsquo;Eye Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Eye-Tracking&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Oculomotor&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Neuropsychol*&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Cognitive&amp;amp;rsquo;) AND (&amp;amp;lsquo;Rehabilitation&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Training&amp;amp;rsquo; OR &amp;amp;lsquo;Stimulation&amp;amp;rsquo;). Study outcomes were thematically classified and qualitatively synthesized. A structured quality assessment was performed. A total of 24 articles were included, addressing neurodevelopmental (preterm infants and children with autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, or ADHD; N = 14), psychiatric (mood and anxiety disorders or alcohol dependence; N = 7), and neurological conditions (stroke; N = 3). Overall, ET gaze-contingent training proved to be effective in improving cognitive and emotional alterations. However, population heterogeneity limits the generalizability of results. ET gaze-contingent protocols allow researchers to directly and dynamically train attentional functions; together with the recruitment of implicit, &amp;amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;amp;rdquo; strategies, these protocols are promising and possibly integrable with traditional cognitive approaches.</p>

     alt="Enhanced nociceptive behavior and expansion of associated primary afferents in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy"/>
<p>Most individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) experience pain, yet it is understudied. We demonstrate altered distribution of nociceptive afferents in the dorsal horn of neonatal rabbits that experienced hypoxic–ischemic injury in utero; these anatomical changes were associated with nocifensive behavior indicative of pain. Our findings suggest that CP-causative injuries alter spinal sensory pathways (not only descending motor circuits), contributing to increased pain in CP.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spastic cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder marked by hypertonia and hyperreflexia; the most prevalent comorbidity is pain. Since spinal nociceptive afferents contribute to both the sensation of painful stimuli as well as reflex circuits involved in movement, we investigated the relationship between prenatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) injury which can cause CP, and possible changes in spinal nociceptive circuitry. To do this, we examined nociceptive afferents and mechanical and thermal sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbit kits after prenatal HI or a sham surgical procedure. As described previously, a range of motor deficits similar to spastic CP was observed in kits born naturally after HI (40 min at ~70%–80% gestation). We found that HI caused an expansion of peptidergic afferents (marked by expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide) in both the superficial and deep dorsal horn at postnatal day (P)5. Non-peptidergic nociceptive afferent arborization (labeled by isolectin B4) was unaltered in HI kits, but overlap of the two populations (peptidergic and non-peptidergic nociceptors) was increased by HI. Density of glial fibrillary acidic protein was unchanged within spinal cord white matter regions important in nociceptive transmission at P5. We found that mechanical and thermal nociception was enhanced in HI kits even in the absence of motor deficits. These findings suggest that prenatal HI injury impacts spinal sensory pathways in addition to the more well-established disruptions to descending motor circuits. In conclusion, changes to spinal nociceptive circuitry could disrupt spinal reflexes and contribute to pain experienced by individuals with CP.</p>

     alt="Effect of endogenous purines on electrically evoked ACh release at the mouse neuromuscular junction"/>
<p>At mammalian neuromuscular junction, ATP is co-released with the neurotransmitter ACh, and once in the synaptic cleft, it is hydrolyzed to adenosine. We report that, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve, the activation of presynaptic purinergic receptors are able to modulate ACh release depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>At the mouse neuromuscular junction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is co-released with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and its metabolite adenosine, modulate neurotransmitter release by activating presynaptic inhibitory P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors (a subtype of ATP/adenosine diphosphate [ADP] receptor), inhibitory A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors, and excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors. To study the effect of endogenous purines, when phrenic-diaphragm preparations are depolarized by different nerve stimulation patterns, we analyzed the effect of the antagonists for P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (AR-C69931MX, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, MRS-1191, and SCH-58261, respectively) on the amplitude of the end-plate potentials of the trains, and contrasted these results with those obtained with the selective agonists of these receptors (2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate trisodium salt hydrate, 2-chloro-N<sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyl-adenosine, inosine, and PSB-0777, respectively). During continuous 0.5-Hz stimulation, the amount of endogenous purines was not enough to activate purinergic receptors, while at continuous 5-Hz stimulation, an incipient action of endogenous purines on P2Y<sub>13</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A3 receptors might be evident just at the end of the trains. During continuous 50-Hz stimulation, the concentration of endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine exerted an inhibitory action on ACh release after of the initial phase of the train, but when the nerve was stimulated at intermittent 50 Hz (5 bursts), this behavior was not observed. Excitatory A<sub>2A</sub> receptors were only activated when continuous 100-Hz stimulation was applied. In conclusion, when motor nerve terminals are depolarized by repetitive stimulation of the phrenic nerve, endogenous ATP/ADP and adenosine are able to fine-tune neurosecretion depending on the frequency and pattern of stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ultrasensitive Quantification of Multiple Estrogens in Songbird Blood and Microdissected Brain by LC-MS/MS</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroestrogens are synthesized within the brain and regulate social behavior, learning and memory, and cognition. In song sparrows, <I>Melospiza melodia</I>, 17&beta;-estradiol (17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB>) promotes aggressive behavior, including during the nonbreeding season when circulating steroid levels are low. Estrogens are challenging to measure because they are present at very low levels, and current techniques often lack the sensitivity required. Furthermore, current methods often focus on 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB> and disregard other estrogens. Here, we developed and validated a method to measure four estrogens [estrone (E<SUB>1</SUB>), 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB>, 17&alpha;-estradiol (17&alpha;-E<SUB>2</SUB>), estriol (E<SUB>3</SUB>)] simultaneously in microdissected songbird brain, with high specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and to improve sensitivity, we derivatized estrogens using 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl-chloride (DMIS). The straightforward protocol improved sensitivity by 10-fold for some analytes. There is substantial regional variation in neuroestrogen levels in brain areas that regulate social behavior in male song sparrows. For example, the auditory area NCM, which has high aromatase levels, has the highest E<SUB>1</SUB> and 17&beta;-E<SUB>2</SUB> levels. In contrast, estrogen levels in blood are very low. Estrogen levels in both brain and circulation are lower in the nonbreeding season than in the breeding season. This technique will be useful for estrogen measurement in songbirds and potentially other animal models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Effects of the G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) on Rat Embryonic (E18) Hippocampal and Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Estrogen plays fundamental roles in nervous system development and function. Traditional studies examining the effect of estrogen in the brain have focused on the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ER&alpha; and ER&beta;. Studies related to the extranuclear, membrane-bound G-protein-coupled ER (GPER/GPR30) have revealed a neuroprotective role for GPER in mature neurons. In this study, we investigated the differential effects of GPER activation in primary rat embryonic day 18 (E18) hippocampal and cortical neurons. Microscopy imaging, multielectrode array (MEA), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments revealed that GPER activation with selective agonist, G-1, and nonselective agonist, 17&beta;-estradiol (E2), increased neural growth, neural firing activity, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> more profoundly in hippocampal neurons than in cortical neurons. The GPER-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in hippocampal neurons involves internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release via activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and extracellular entry via Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Immunocytochemistry results revealed no observable difference in GPER expression/localization in neurons, yet real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting showed a higher GPER expression in the cortex than hippocampus, implying that GPER expression level may not fully account for its robust physiological effects in hippocampal neurons. We used RNA sequencing data to identify distinctly enriched pathways and significantly expressed genes in response to G-1 or E2 in cultured rat E18 hippocampal and cortical neurons. In summary, the identification of differential effects of GPER activation on hippocampal and cortical neurons in the brain and the determination of key genes and molecular pathways are instrumental toward an understanding of estrogen&rsquo;s action in early neuronal development.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Explainable deep transfer learning model for disease risk prediction using high-dimensional genomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Long Liu, Qingyu Meng, Cherry Weng, Qing Lu, Tong Wang, Yalu Wen</p>

Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dimensionality reduction of longitudinal ’omics data using modern tensor factorizations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Uria Mor, Yotam Cohen, Rafael Valdés-Mas, Denise Kviatcovsky, Eran Elinav, Haim Avron</p>

Longitudinal ’omics analytical methods are extensively used in the field of evolving precision medicine, by enabling ‘big data’ recording and high-resolution interpretation of complex datasets, driven by individual variations in response to perturbations such as disease pathogenesis, medical treatment or changes in lifestyle. However, inherent technical limitations in biomedical studies often result in the generation of feature-rich and sample-limited datasets. Analyzing such data using conventional modalities often proves to be challenging since the repeated, high-dimensional measurements overload the outlook with inconsequential variations that must be filtered from the data in order to find the true, biologically relevant signal. Tensor methods for the analysis and meaningful representation of multi-way data may prove useful to the biological research community by their advertised ability to tackle this challenge. In this study, we present tcam—a new unsupervised tensor factorization method for the analysis of multi-way data. Building on top of cutting-edge developments in the field of tensor-tensor algebra, we characterize the unique mathematical properties of our method, namely, 1) preservation of geometric and statistical traits of the data, which enables uncovering information beyond the inter-individual variation that often takes-over the focus, especially in human studies. 2) Natural and straightforward out-of-sample extension, making tcam amenable for integration in machine learning workflows. A series of re-analyses of real-world, human experimental datasets showcase these theoretical properties, while providing empirical confirmation of tcam’s utility in the analysis of longitudinal ’omics data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Leveraging a physiologically-based quantitative translational modeling platform for designing B cell maturation antigen-targeting bispecific T cell engagers for treatment of multiple myeloma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomoki Yoneyama, Mi-Sook Kim, Konstantin Piatkov, Haiqing Wang, Andy Z. X. Zhu</p>

Bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) are an emerging anti-cancer modality that redirects cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), thereby forming immune synapses to exert anti-tumor effects. Designing pharmacokinetically acceptable TCEs and optimizing their size presents a considerable protein engineering challenge, particularly given the complexity of intercellular bridging between T cells and tumor cells. Therefore, a physiologically-relevant and clinically-verified computational modeling framework is of crucial importance to understand the protein engineering trade-offs. In this study, we developed a quantitative, physiologically-based computational framework to predict immune synapse formation for a variety of molecular formats of TCEs in tumor tissues. Our model incorporates a molecular size-dependent biodistribution using the two-pore theory, extravasation of T cells and hematologic cancer cells, mechanistic bispecific intercellular binding of TCEs, and competitive inhibitory interactions by shed targets. The biodistribution of TCEs was verified by positron emission tomography imaging of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]AMG211 (a carcinoembryonic antigen-targeting TCE) in patients. Parameter sensitivity analyses indicated that immune synapse formation was highly sensitive to TAA expression, degree of target shedding, and binding selectivity to tumor cell surface TAAs over shed targets. Notably, the model suggested a “sweet spot” for TCEs’ CD3 binding affinity, which balanced the trapping of TCEs in T-cell-rich organs. The final model simulations indicated that the number of immune synapses is similar (~55/tumor cell) between two distinct clinical stage B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting TCEs, PF-06863135 in an IgG format and AMG420 in a BiTE format, at their respective efficacious doses in multiple myeloma patients. This result demonstrates the applicability of the developed computational modeling framework to molecular design optimization and clinical benchmarking for TCEs, thus suggesting that this framework can be applied to other targets to provide a quantitative means to facilitate model-informed best-in-class TCE discovery and development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A Krüppel-like factor is required for development and regeneration of germline and yolk cells from somatic stem cells in planarians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie Issigonis, Akshada B. Redkar, Tania Rozario, Umair W. Khan, Rosa Mejia-Sanchez, Sylvain W. Lapan, Peter W. Reddien, Phillip A. Newmark</p>

Sexually reproducing animals segregate their germline from their soma. In addition to gamete-producing gonads, planarian and parasitic flatworm reproduction relies on yolk cell–generating accessory reproductive organs (vitellaria) supporting development of yolkless oocytes. Despite the importance of vitellaria for flatworm reproduction (and parasite transmission), little is known about this unique evolutionary innovation. Here, we examine reproductive system development in the planarian <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i>, in which pluripotent stem cells generate both somatic and germ cell lineages. We show that a homolog of the pluripotency factor Klf4 is expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs), presumptive germline stem cells (GSCs), and yolk cell progenitors. Knockdown of this <i>klf4-like</i> (<i>klf4l</i>) gene results in animals that fail to specify or maintain germ cells; surprisingly, they also fail to maintain yolk cells. We find that yolk cells display germ cell–like attributes and that vitellaria are structurally analogous to gonads. In addition to identifying a new proliferative cell population in planarians (yolk cell progenitors) and defining its niche, our work provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that flatworm germ cells and yolk cells share a common evolutionary origin.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal dentate gyrus integrity revealed with ultrahigh resolution diffusion imaging predicts memory performance in older adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is a core feature of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While regional volumes and thickness are often used as a proxy for neurodegeneration, they lack the sensitivity to serve as an accurate diagnostic test and indicate advanced neurodegeneration. Here, we used a submillimeter resolution diffusion weighted MRI sequence (ZOOMit) to quantify microstructural properties of hippocampal subfields in older adults (63–98 years old) using tensor derived measures: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We demonstrate that the high-resolution sequence, and not a standard resolution sequence, identifies dissociable profiles for CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), and the collateral sulcus. Using ZOOMit, we show that advanced age is associated with increased MD of the CA1 and DG as well as decreased FA of the DG. Increased MD of the DG, reflecting decreased cellular density, mediated the relationship between age and word list recall. Further, increased MD in the DG, but not DG volume, was linked to worse spatial pattern separation.

                Understanding how genetic variation shapes a complex trait relies on accurately quantifying both the additive genetic and genotype–environment interaction effects in an age-dependent manner. We used a linear mixed model to quantify diet-dependent genetic contributions to body weight measured through adulthood in diversity outbred female mice under five diets. We observed that heritability of body weight declined with age under all diets, except the 40% calorie restriction diet. We identified 14 loci with age-dependent associations and 19 loci with age- and diet-dependent associations, with many diet-dependent loci previously linked to neurological function and behavior in mice or humans. We found their allelic effects to be dynamic with respect to genomic background, age, and diet, identifying several loci where distinct alleles affect body weight at different ages. These results enable us to more fully understand and predict the effectiveness of dietary intervention on overall health throughout age in distinct genetic backgrounds.

                The supraspinal connectome is essential for normal behavior and homeostasis and consists of numerous sensory, motor, and autonomic projections from brain to spinal cord. Study of supraspinal control and its restoration after damage has focused mostly on a handful of major populations that carry motor commands, with only limited consideration of dozens more that provide autonomic or crucial motor modulation. Here we assemble an experimental workflow to rapidly profile the entire supraspinal mesoconnectome in adult mice and disseminate the output in a web-based resource. Optimized viral labeling, 3D imaging, and registration to a mouse digital neuroanatomical atlas assigned tens of thousands of supraspinal neurons to 69 identified regions. We demonstrate the ability of this approach to clarify essential points of topographic mapping between spinal levels, to measure population-specific sensitivity to spinal injury, and to test relationships between region-specific neuronal sparing and variability in functional recovery. This work will spur progress by broadening understanding of essential but understudied supraspinal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Brain-wide screen of prelimbic cortex inputs reveals a functional shift during early fear memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation and storage rely on multiple interconnected brain areas, the contribution of which varies during memory consolidation. The medial prefrontal cortex, in particular the prelimbic cortex (PL), was traditionally found to be involved in remote memory storage, but recent evidence points toward its implication in early consolidation as well. Nevertheless, the inputs to the PL governing these dynamics remain unknown. Here, we first performed a brain-wide, rabies-based retrograde tracing screen of PL engram cells activated during contextual fear memory formation in male mice to identify relevant PL input regions. Next, we assessed the specific activity pattern of these inputs across different phases of memory consolidation, from fear memory encoding to recent and remote memory recall. Using projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition, we then tested their functional role in memory consolidation, which revealed a hitherto unknown contribution of claustrum to PL inputs at encoding, and of insular cortex to PL inputs at recent memory recall. Both of these inputs further impacted how PL engram cells were reactivated at memory recall, testifying to their relevance for establishing a memory trace in the PL. Collectively, these data identify a spatiotemporal shift in PL inputs important for early memory consolidation, and thereby help to refine the working model of memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of allelic cross-reactivity of monoclonal IgG antibodies by a multiplexed reverse FluoroSpot assay</a></h4>

              
                The issue of antibody cross-reactivity is of central importance in immunology, and not least in protective immunity to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria, where key antigens show substantial allelic variation (polymorphism). However, serological analysis often does not allow the distinction between true cross-reactivity (one antibody recognizing multiple antigen variants) and apparent cross-reactivity (presence of multiple variant-specific antibodies), as it requires analysis at the single B-cell/monoclonal antibody level. ELISpot is an assay that enables that, and a recently developed multiplexed variant of ELISpot (FluoroSpot) facilitates simultaneous assessment of B-cell/antibody reactivity to several different antigens. In this study, we present a further enhancement of this assay that makes direct analysis of monoclonal antibody-level cross-reactivity with allelic variants feasible. Using VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1—a notoriously polymorphic antigen involved in the pathogenesis of placental malaria—as a model, we demonstrate the robustness of the assay and its applicability to analysis of true cross-reactivity of monoclonal VAR2CSA-specific antibodies in naturally exposed individuals. The assay is adaptable to the analysis of other polymorphic antigens, rendering it a powerful tool in studies of immunity to malaria and many other diseases.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–organelle tethering occurs in part through the interaction of the ER resident protein VAP with FFAT motif-containing proteins. FFAT motifs are characterized by a seven amino acidic core surrounded by acid tracks. We have previously shown that the human intracellular bacterial pathogen <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> establishes MCS between its vacuole (the inclusion) and the ER through expression of a bacterial tether, IncV, displaying molecular mimicry of eukaryotic FFAT motif cores. Here, we show that multiple layers of host cell kinase-mediated phosphorylation events govern the assembly of the IncV–VAP tethering complex and the formation of ER-Inclusion MCS. Via a C-terminal region containing three CK2 phosphorylation motifs, IncV recruits CK2 to the inclusion leading to IncV hyperphosphorylation of the noncanonical FFAT motif core and serine-rich tracts immediately upstream of IncV FFAT motif cores. Phosphorylatable serine tracts, rather than genetically encoded acidic tracts, accommodate Type III-mediated translocation of IncV to the inclusion membrane, while achieving full mimicry of FFAT motifs. Thus, regulatory components and post-translational modifications are integral to MCS biology, and intracellular pathogens such as <i>C. trachomatis</i> have evolved complex molecular mimicry of these eukaryotic features.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A non-transcriptional function of Yap regulates the DNA replication program</a></h4>

              
                In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the initiation of DNA replication occurs asynchronously throughout S-phase according to a regulated replication timing program. Here, using <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts, we showed that Yap (Yes-associated protein 1), a downstream effector of the Hippo signalling pathway, is required for the control of DNA replication dynamics. We found that Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA replication and identified Rif1, a major regulator of the DNA replication timing program, as a novel Yap binding protein. Furthermore, we show that either Yap or Rif1 depletion accelerates DNA replication dynamics by increasing the number of activated replication origins. In <i>Xenopus</i> embryos, using a Trim-Away approach during cleavage stages devoid of transcription, we found that either Yap or Rif1 depletion triggers an acceleration of cell divisions, suggesting a shorter S-phase by alterations of the replication program. Finally, our data show that Rif1 knockdown leads to defects in the partitioning of early versus late replication foci in retinal stem cells, as we previously showed for Yap. Altogether, our findings unveil a non-transcriptional role for Yap in regulating replication dynamics. We propose that Yap and Rif1 function as breaks to control the DNA replication program in early embryos and post-embryonic stem cells.

                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprise a novel class of regulatory RNAs that are abundant in the brain, particularly within synapses. They are highly stable, dynamically regulated, and display a range of functional roles, including as decoys for miRNAs and proteins and, in some cases, translation. Early work in animal models revealed an association between circRNAs and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders; however, relatively few studies have shown a causal link between circRNA function and memory. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced circRNAs in the synaptosome compartment of the medial prefrontal cortex of fear extinction trained male C57BL/6J mice and found 12837 circRNAs enriched at the synapse, including Cdr1as. Targeted knockdown of Cdr1as in the neural processes of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6J mice led to impaired fear extinction memory. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of localised circRNA activity at the synapse for memory formation and suggest that circRNAs may have a more widespread effect on brain function than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite gating in tonic sensory circuits integrates multimodal context to control persistent behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                Maintaining or shifting between behavioral states according to context is essential for animals to implement fitness-promoting strategies. How integration of internal state, past experience and sensory inputs orchestrate persistent multidimensional behavior changes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that C. elegans integrates food availability and environment temperature over different timescales to engage in persistent dwelling, scanning, global or glocal search strategies matching thermoregulatory and feeding needs. Transition between states, in each case, requires lifting multiple regulatory gates including AFD or FLP tonic sensory neurons activity, neuropeptide expression and downstream circuit responsiveness. State-specific FLP-6 or FLP-5 neuropeptide signaling acts on a distributed set of inhibitory receptors to promote scanning or glocal search, respectively, bypassing dopamine and glutamate-dependent behavioral state control. Multisite gating-dependent behavioral switch by GPCRs in tonic sensory circuits might represent a conserved regulatory logic for persistent behavioral state transitions enabling a flexible prioritization on the valance of multiple inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beta bursts over frontal cortex track the surprise of unexpected events in auditory, visual, and tactile modalities</a></h4>

              
                One of the fundamental ways in which the brain regulates and monitors behavior is by making predictions about the sensory environment and adjusting behavior when those expectations are violated. As such, surprise is one of the fundamental computations performed by the human brain. In recent years, it has been well-established that one key aspect by which behavior is adjusted during surprise is inhibitory control of the motor system. Moreover, since surprise automatically triggers inhibitory control without much proactive influence, it can provide unique insights into largely reactive control processes. Recent years have seen tremendous interest in burst-like beta frequency events in the human (and non-human) local field potential--especially over (pre)frontal cortex--as a potential signature of inhibitory control. To date, beta-bursts have only been studied in paradigms involving a substantial amount of proactive control (such as the stop-signal task). Here, we used two cross-modal oddball tasks to investigate whether surprise processing is accompanied by increases in scalp-recorded beta-bursts. Indeed, we found that unexpected events in all tested sensory domains (haptic, auditory, visual) were followed by low-latency increases in beta-bursting over frontal cortex. Moreover, across experiments, beta-burst rates were positively correlated with estimates of surprise derived from Shannon's information theory. As such, the current work clearly implicates frontal beta-bursts as a signature of surprise processing. We discuss these findings in the context of common frameworks of inhibitory and cognitive control after unexpected events.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms underlying reshuffling of visual responses by optogenetic stimulation in mice and monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The ability to observe the response of neural circuits to controlled optogenetic perturbations opens an unprecedented window into the mechanisms governing network dynamics and computations. We combined an analysis of neuronal responses to visual and optogenetic inputs in mice and monkey V1 with theoretical modelling. In both species, we found that optogenetic stimulation of excitatory neurons strongly modulated the activity of single neurons, but had only a weak effect on the distribution of firing rates across the population. Key statistics of responses of mice and monkeys lay on a continuum, with mice/monkeys occupying the low/high rate regions, respectively. At high contrast of the visual stimulus, optogenetic inputs did not significantly affect the distribution of firing rates, i.e. they reshuffled firing rates across the network. We show that neuronal reshuffling emerges generically in randomly connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as long as the combination of recurrent coupling and feedforward input is sufficiently strong so that a powerful inhibitory feedback cancels the mean increase in firing rate due to optogenetic input.

                Predictions are constantly generated from diverse sources to optimize cognitive functions in the ever-changing environment. However, the neural origin and generation process of top-down induced prediction remain elusive. We hypothesized that motor-based and memory-based predictions are mediated by distinct feedback networks from motor and memory systems to the sensory cortices. Using fMRI and a dual imagery paradigm, we showed that motor and memory upstream systems excited the auditory cortex in a content-specific manner. Moreover, the inferior and posterior parts of the parietal lobe differentially relayed predictive signals in motor-to-sensory and memory-to-sensory networks. Our results reveal the functionally distinct neural networks that mediate top-down sensory prediction and ground the neurocomputational basis of predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional Profiling of the Hippocampus in an F2 Cross of a Genetic Rat Model of Internalizing vs. Externalizing Behavior and Addiction Liability</a></h4>

              
                In humans, differences in temperament are highly predictive of classes of psychopathology classified as externalizing versus internalizing disorders. To better understand the genetic and neural causes of temperamental differences, we have selectively bred two lines of rats based on their exploration of a novel environment. The bred High Responder (bHR) and bred Low Responder (bLR) rats show contrasting heritable behaviors that map onto human temperamental differences and are associated with two paths to drug abuse--sensation seeking and reactivity to psychosocial stress. To elucidate the genes that underlie the divergent behavior of bHR/bLR rats, we created a bHRxbLR F0-F1-F2 cross and performed behavioral testing, transcriptional profiling, and genetic sequencing. We used RNA-Seq to characterize hippocampal tissue in F0s (n=24, n=6 per phenotype /sex) and F2s (n=250, n=125 per sex) to identify differentially expressed genes related to bHR/bLR lineage and phenotypical behaviors: locomotor response to novelty, anxiety, and Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PavCA).

We found that bHR/bLR phenotypical behaviors remained correlated in the F2s, implying a shared genetic basis. We also found robust differences in hippocampal transcriptional profiles associated with bHR/bLR lineage in the F0s which surpassed the differences associated with sex. These distinct expression profiles were predictive of gene expression patterns associated with F2 bHR/bLR behavior. We then prioritized bHR/bLR differentially expressed genes identified in our current and previous studies as candidates for mediating bHR/bLR phenotypical behaviors in F2s. Seventeen genes were differentially expressed in association with locomotor response to novelty, many of which also had nominal relationships with PavCA behavior. Seven of these genes were located near (+/-1MB) quantitative trait loci for bHR/bLR phenotypical behavior identified in our previous exome sequencing or genome wide association studies: AABR07071904, Ucp2, Ttc30a1, Fzd6, Spg7, Vps9d1, and Afg3l1. We also identified convergence between our model and other genetic rat models targeting internalizing behaviors, with 26 hippocampal genes showing shared patterns of differential expression, including Tmem144 and Mfge8. Our findings provide strong candidates for elucidating genetic and neurobiological factors that may shape differences in temperament and modulate vulnerability to psychiatric and addictive disorders.

	<p>In conversational speech, phones and entire syllables are often missing. This can make &amp;amp;ldquo;he&amp;amp;rsquo;s&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;he was&amp;amp;rdquo; homophonous, realized for example as [&amp;amp;#616;z]. Similarly, &amp;amp;ldquo;you&amp;amp;rsquo;re&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;you were&amp;amp;rdquo; can both be realized as [j&amp;amp;#602;], [&amp;amp;#616;], etc. We investigated what types of information native listeners use to perceive such verb tenses. Possible types included acoustic cues in the phrase (e.g., in &amp;amp;ldquo;he was&amp;amp;rdquo;), the rate of the surrounding speech, and syntactic and semantic information in the utterance, such as the presence of time adverbs such as &amp;amp;ldquo;yesterday&amp;amp;rdquo; or other tensed verbs. We extracted utterances such as &amp;amp;ldquo;So they&amp;amp;rsquo;re gonna have like a random roommate&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;And he was like, &amp;amp;lsquo;What&amp;amp;rsquo;s wrong?!&amp;amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;rdquo; from recordings of spontaneous conversations. We presented parts of these utterances to listeners, in either a written or auditory modality, to determine which types of information facilitated listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; comprehension. Listeners rely primarily on acoustic cues in or near the target words rather than meaning and syntactic information in the context. While that information also improves comprehension in some conditions, the acoustic cues in the target itself are strong enough to reverse the percept that listeners gain from all other information together. Acoustic cues override other information in comprehending reduced productions in conversational speech.</p>

	<p>Predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest remains a major issue. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers capable of predicting neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest. Expression profiles of GSE29540 and GSE92696 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low brain performance category (CPC) scoring subgroups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to screen key gene modules and crossover genes in these datasets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of crossover genes was constructed from the STRING database. Based on the PPI network, the most important hub genes were identified by the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape software. Eight hub genes (RPL27, EEF1B2, PFDN5, RBX1, PSMD14, HINT1, SNRPD2, and RPL26) were finally screened and validated, which were downregulated in the group with poor neurological prognosis. In addition, GSEA identified critical pathways associated with these genes. Finally, a Pearson correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expression of hub genes EEF1B2, PSMD14, RPFDN5, RBX1, and SNRPD2 were significantly and positively correlated with NDS scores in rats. Our work could provide comprehensive insights into understanding pathogenesis and potential new biomarkers for predicting neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest.</p>

	<p>Electric and magnetic stimulation of the human brain can be used to excite or inhibit neurons. Numerous methods have been designed over the years for this purpose with various advantages and disadvantages that are the topic of this review. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most direct and focal application of electric impulses to brain tissue. Electrodes are placed in the brain in order to modulate neural activity and to correct parameters of pathological oscillation in brain circuits such as their amplitude or frequency. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive alternative with the stimulator generating a magnetic field in a coil over the scalp that induces an electric field in the brain which, in turn, interacts with ongoing brain activity. Depending upon stimulation parameters, excitation and inhibition can be achieved. Transcranial electric stimulation (tES) applies electric fields to the scalp that spread along the skull in order to reach the brain, thus, limiting current strength to avoid skin sensations and cranial muscle pain. Therefore, tES can only modulate brain activity and is considered subthreshold, i.e., it does not directly elicit neuronal action potentials. In this review, we collect hints for neuroplastic changes such as modulation of behavior, the electric activity of the brain, or the evolution of clinical signs and symptoms in response to stimulation. Possible mechanisms are discussed, and future paradigms are suggested.</p>

	<p>The evaluation of nanomechanical properties of tissues in health and disease is of increasing interest to scientists. It has been confirmed that these properties, determined in part by the composition of the extracellular matrix, significantly affect tissue physiology and the biological behavior of cells, mainly in terms of their adhesion, mobility, or ability to mutate. Importantly, pathophysiological changes that determine disease development within the tissue usually result in significant changes in tissue mechanics that might potentially affect the drug efficacy, which is important from the perspective of development of new therapeutics, since most of the currently used in vitro experimental models for drug testing do not account for these properties. Here, we provide a summary of the current understanding of how the mechanical properties of brain tissue change in pathological conditions, and how the activity of the therapeutic agents is linked to this mechanical state.</p>

	<p>There are many applications controlled by the brain signals to bridge the gap in the digital divide between the disabled and the non-disabled people. The deployment of novel assistive technologies using brain-computer interface (BCI) will go a long way toward achieving this lofty goal, especially after the successes demonstrated by these technologies in the daily life of people with severe disabilities. This paper contributes in this direction by proposing an integrated framework to control the operating system functionalities using Electroencephalography signals. Different signal processing algorithms were applied to remove artifacts, extract features, and classify trials. The proposed approach includes different classification algorithms dedicated to detecting the P300 responses efficiently. The predicted commands passed through a socket to the API system, permitting the control of the operating system functionalities. The proposed system outperformed those obtained by the winners of the BCI competition and reached an accuracy average of 94.5% according to the offline approach. The framework was evaluated according to the online process and achieved an excellent accuracy attaining 97% for some users but not less than 90% for others. The suggested framework enhances the information accessibility for people with severe disabilities and helps them perform their daily tasks efficiently. It permits the interaction between the user and personal computers through the brain signals without any muscular efforts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Navigating the Statistical Minefield of Model Selection and Clustering in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Model selection is often implicit: when performing an ANOVA, one assumes that the normal distribution is a good model of the data; fitting a tuning curve implies that an additive and a multiplicative scaler describes the behavior of the neuron; even calculating an average implicitly assumes that the data were sampled from a distribution that has a finite first statistical moment: the mean. Model selection may be explicit, when the aim is to test whether one model provides a better description of the data than a competing one. As a special case, clustering algorithms identify groups with similar properties within the data. They are widely used from spike sorting to cell type identification to gene expression analysis. We discuss model selection and clustering techniques from a statistician&rsquo;s point of view, revealing the assumptions behind, and the logic that governs the various approaches. We also showcase important neuroscience applications and provide suggestions how neuroscientists could put model selection algorithms to best use as well as what mistakes should be avoided.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">If you don’t let it in, you don’t have to get it out: Thought preemption as a method to control unwanted thoughts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Isaac Fradkin, Eran Eldar</p>

To attain goals, people must proactively prevent interferences and react to interferences once they occur. Whereas most research focuses on how people deal with external interferences, here we investigate the use of proactive and reactive control in dealing with unwanted thoughts. To examine this question, we asked people to generate an association to each of several repeating cue words, while forbidding the repetition of associations. Reactively rejecting and replacing unwanted repeated associations after they occur entails slower response times. Conversely, proactive control entails constricting the search space and thus faster response times. To gain further insight into different potential proactive thought control mechanisms, we augmented the analysis of raw response times with a novel, hypothesis-based, tractable computational model describing how people serially sample associations. Our results indicate that people primarily react to unwanted thoughts after they occur. Yet, we found evidence for two latent proactive control mechanisms: one that allows people to mitigate the episodic strengthening of repeated thoughts, and another that helps avoid looping in a repetitive thought. Exploratory analysis showed a relationship between model parameters and self-reported individual differences in the control over unwanted thoughts in daily life. The findings indicate the novel task and model can advance our understanding of how people can and cannot control their thoughts and memories, and benefit future research on the mechanisms responsible for unwanted thought in different psychiatric conditions. Finally, we discuss implications concerning the involvement of associative thinking and various control processes in semantic fluency, decision-making and creativity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">NucleoMap: A computational tool for identifying nucleosomes in ultra-high resolution contact maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuanhao Huang, Bingjiang Wang, Jie Liu</p>

Although poorly positioned nucleosomes are ubiquitous in the eukaryotic genome, they are difficult to identify with existing nucleosome identification methods. Recently available enhanced high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques such as Micro-C, DNase Hi-C, and Hi-CO characterize nucleosome-level chromatin proximity, probing the positions of mono-nucleosomes and the spacing between nucleosome pairs at the same time, enabling nucleosome profiling in poorly positioned regions. Here we develop a novel computational approach, NucleoMap, to identify nucleosome positioning from ultra-high resolution chromatin contact maps. By integrating nucleosome read density, contact distances, and binding preferences, NucleoMap precisely locates nucleosomes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and outperforms existing nucleosome identification methods in both precision and recall. We rigorously characterize genome-wide association in eukaryotes between the spatial organization of mono-nucleosomes and their corresponding histone modifications, protein binding activities, and higher-order chromatin functions. We also find evidence of two tetra-nucleosome folding structures in human embryonic stem cells and analyze their association with multiple structural and functional regions. Based on the identified nucleosomes, nucleosome contact maps are constructed, reflecting the inter-nucleosome distances and preserving the contact distance profiles in original contact maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling livestock infectious disease control policy under differing social perspectives on vaccination behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Edward M. Hill, Naomi S. Prosser, Eamonn Ferguson, Jasmeet Kaler, Martin J. Green, Matt J. Keeling, Michael J. Tildesley</p>

The spread of infection amongst livestock depends not only on the traits of the pathogen and the livestock themselves, but also on the veterinary health behaviours of farmers and how this impacts their implementation of disease control measures. Controls that are costly may make it beneficial for individuals to rely on the protection offered by others, though that may be sub-optimal for the population. Failing to account for socio-behavioural properties may produce a substantial layer of bias in infectious disease models. We investigated the role of heterogeneity in vaccine response across a population of farmers on epidemic outbreaks amongst livestock, caused by pathogens with differential speed of spread over spatial landscapes of farms for two counties in England (Cumbria and Devon). Under different compositions of three vaccine behaviour groups (precautionary, reactionary, non-vaccination), we evaluated from population- and individual-level perspectives the optimum threshold distance to premises with notified infection that would trigger responsive vaccination by the reactionary vaccination group. We demonstrate a divergence between population and individual perspectives in the optimal scale of reactive voluntary vaccination response. In general, minimising the population-level perspective cost requires a broader reactive uptake of the intervention, whilst optimising the outcome for the average individual increased the likelihood of larger scale disease outbreaks. When the relative cost of vaccination was low and the majority of premises had undergone precautionary vaccination, then adopting a perspective that optimised the outcome for an individual gave a broader spatial extent of reactive response compared to a perspective wanting to optimise outcomes for everyone in the population. Under our assumed epidemiological context, the findings identify livestock disease intervention receptiveness and cost combinations where one would expect strong disagreement between the intervention stringency that is best from the perspective of a stakeholder responsible for supporting the livestock industry compared to a sole livestock owner. Were such discord anticipated and achieving a consensus view across perspectives desired, the findings may also inform those managing veterinary health policy the requisite reduction in intervention cost and/or the required extent of nurturing beneficial community attitudes towards interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for designing and running a computing minor for bio/chem students</a></h4>

Science students increasingly need programming and data science skills to be competitive in the modern workforce. However, at our university (San Francisco State University), until recently, almost no biology, biochemistry, and chemistry students (from here bio/chem students) completed a minor in computer science. To change this, a new minor in computing applications, which is informally known as the Promoting Inclusivity in Computing (PINC) minor, was established in 2016. Here, we present the lessons we learned from our experience in a set of 10 rules. The first 3 rules focus on setting up the program so that it interests students in biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. Rules 4 through 8 focus on how the classes of the program are taught to make them interesting for our students and to provide the students with the support they need. The last 2 rules are about what happens “behind the scenes” of running a program with many people from several departments involved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neural dynamics differentially encode phrases and sentences during spoken language comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fan Bai, Antje S. Meyer, Andrea E. Martin</p>

Human language stands out in the natural world as a biological signal that uses a structured system to combine the meanings of small linguistic units (e.g., words) into larger constituents (e.g., phrases and sentences). However, the physical dynamics of speech (or sign) do not stand in a one-to-one relationship with the meanings listeners perceive. Instead, listeners infer meaning based on their knowledge of the language. The neural readouts of the perceptual and cognitive processes underlying these inferences are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the neural response to phrases (e.g., the red vase) and sentences (e.g., the vase is red), which were close in semantic meaning and had been synthesized to be physically indistinguishable. Differences in structure were well captured in the reorganization of neural phase responses in delta (approximately <2 Hz) and theta bands (approximately 2 to 7 Hz),and in power and power connectivity changes in the alpha band (approximately 7.5 to 13.5 Hz). Consistent with predictions from a computational model, sentences showed more power, more power connectivity, and more phase synchronization than phrases did. Theta–gamma phase–amplitude coupling occurred, but did not differ between the syntactic structures. Spectral–temporal response function (STRF) modeling revealed different encoding states for phrases and sentences, over and above the acoustically driven neural response. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of how the brain encodes and separates linguistic structures in the dynamics of neural responses. They imply that phase synchronization and strength of connectivity are readouts for the constituent structure of language. The results provide a novel basis for future neurophysiological research on linguistic structure representation in the brain, and, together with our simulations, support time-based binding as a mechanism of structure encoding in neural dynamics.

     alt="An atlas of the developing Tribolium castaneum brain reveals conservation in anatomy and divergence in timing to Drosophila melanogaster"/>
<p>We examined the developing brain of the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. We determined tracts, fascicles, and compartments (a) by combining tubulin and synapsin stainings (b) in three developing stages (b’). The result is a comprehensive anatomical atlas (c) that was compared with the fruitfly and is provided for user-friendly interaction (d).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Insect brains are formed by conserved sets of neural lineages whose fibers form cohesive bundles with characteristic projection patterns. Within the brain neuropil, these bundles establish a system of fascicles constituting the macrocircuitry of the brain. The overall architecture of the neuropils and the macrocircuitry appear to be conserved. However, variation is observed, for example, in size, shape, and timing of development. Unfortunately, the developmental and genetic basis of this variation is poorly understood, although the rise of new genetically tractable model organisms such as the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> allows the possibility to gain mechanistic insights. To facilitate such work, we present an atlas of the developing brain of <i>T. castaneum</i>, covering the first larval instar, the prepupal stage, and the adult, by combining wholemount immunohistochemical labeling of fiber bundles (acetylated tubulin) and neuropils (synapsin) with digital 3D reconstruction using the TrakEM2 software package. Upon comparing this anatomical dataset with the published work in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we confirm an overall high degree of conservation. Fiber tracts and neuropil fascicles, which can be visualized by global neuronal antibodies like antiacetylated tubulin in all invertebrate brains, create a rich anatomical framework to which individual neurons or other regions of interest can be referred to. The framework of a largely conserved pattern allowed us to describe differences between the two species with respect to parameters such as timing of neuron proliferation and maturation. These features likely reflect adaptive changes in developmental timing that govern the change from larval to adult brain.</p>

     alt="Neuronal density and expression of calcium-binding proteins across the layers of the superior colliculus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>Using stereological sampling, we demonstrate that neuronal density decreases across layers of the superior colliculus in marmoset monkeys. Neuronal density in this structure tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) display variable gradients of density across layers in the superior colliculus. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the upper layers, while the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons is more uniform.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure with functions that include polysensory and sensorimotor integration. Here, we describe the distribution of different immunohistochemically identified classes of neurons in the SC of adult marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was used to determine the overall neuronal density in the different SC layers. In addition, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [CB], parvalbumin [PV] and calretinin [CR]). Our results indicate that neuronal density in the SC decreases from superficial to deep layers. Although the neuronal density within the same layer varies little across the mediolateral axis, it tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Cells expressing different calcium-binding proteins display differential gradients of density according to depth. Both CB- and CR-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), compared to the stratum opticum and intermediate and deep layers. However, CR-expressing neurons are twice as common as CB-expressing neurons outside the SGS. The distribution of PV-expressing cells follows a shallow density gradient from superficial to deep layers. When normalized relative to total neuronal density, the proportion of CR-expressing neurons increases between the superficial and intermediate layers, whereas that of CB-expressing neurons declines toward the deep layers. The proportion of PV-expressing neurons remains constant across layers. Our data provide layer-specific and accurate estimates of neuronal density, which may be important for the generation of biophysical models of how the primate SC transforms sensory inputs into motor signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel abundance at active zones through a balance of delivery and turnover</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to trigger neurotransmitter release at specialized presynaptic sites termed active zones (AZs). The abundance of VGCCs at AZs regulates neurotransmitter release probability (<i>P<sub>r</sub></i>), a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength. Although biosynthesis, delivery and recycling cooperate to establish AZ VGCC abundance, experimentally isolating these distinct regulatory processes has been difficult. Here we describe how the AZ levels of Cacophony (Cac), the sole VGCC mediating synaptic transmission in <i>Drosophila</i>, are determined. We also analyzed the relationship between Cac, the conserved VGCC regulatory subunit α2δ, and the core AZ scaffold protein Bruchpilot (BRP) in establishing a functional AZ. We find Cac and BRP are independently regulated at growing AZs, as Cac is dispensable for AZ formation and structural maturation, and BRP abundance is not limiting for Cac accumulation. Additionally, AZs stop accumulating Cac after an initial growth phase, whereas BRP levels continue to increase given extended developmental time. AZ Cac is also buffered against moderate increases or decreases in biosynthesis, whereas BRP lacks this buffering. To probe mechanisms that determine AZ Cac abundance, intravital FRAP and Cac photoconversion were used to separately measure delivery and turnover at individual AZs over a multi-day period. Cac delivery occurs broadly across the AZ population, correlates with AZ size, and is rate-limited by α2δ. Although Cac does not undergo significant lateral transfer between neighboring AZs over the course of development, Cac removal from AZs does occur and is promoted by new Cac delivery, generating a cap on Cac accumulation at mature AZs. Together these findings reveal how Cac biosynthesis, synaptic delivery, and recycling set the abundance of VGCCs at individual AZs throughout synapse development and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Impaired astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in awake-behaving Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                Increased astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown in Alzheimer's disease mouse models, but to date no reports have characterized behaviorally induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in such mice. Here, we employ an event-based algorithm to assess astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the neocortex of awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice and non-transgenic wildtype littermates while monitoring pupil responses and behavior. We demonstrate an attenuated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to locomotion and an uncoupling of pupil responses and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in 15-months old plaque-bearing mice. Using the genetically encoded fluorescent norepinephrine sensor GRAB<sub>NE</sub> we demonstrate a reduced norepinephrine signaling during spontaneous running and startle responses in the transgenic mice, providing a possible mechanistic underpinning of the observed reduced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our data points to a dysfunction in the norepinephrine-astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity-axis, which may account for some of the cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transgenic quails reveal dynamic TCF/β-catenin signaling during avian embryonic development</a></h4>

              
                The Wnt/bβ-catenin signaling pathway is highly conserved throughout evolution, playing crucial roles in several developmental and pathological processes. Wnt ligands can act at a considerable distance from their sources and it is therefore necessary to examine not only the Wnt-producing but also the Wnt-receiving cells and tissues to fully appreciate the many functions of this pathway. To monitor Wnt activity, multiple tools have been designed which consist of multimerized Wnt signaling response elements (TCF/LEF binding sites) driving the expression of fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g. GFP, RFP) or of LacZ. The high stability of those reporters leads to a considerable accumulation in cells activating the pathway, thereby making them easily detectable. However, this makes them unsuitable to follow temporal changes of the pathway's activity during dynamic biological events. Even though fluorescent transcriptional reporters can be destabilized to shorten their half-lives, this dramatically reduces signal intensities, particularly when applied <i>in vivo</i>. To alleviate these issues, we developed two transgenic quail lines in which high copy number (12x or 16x) of the TCF/LEF binding sites drive the expression of destabilized GFP variants. Translational enhancer sequences derived from viral mRNAs were used to increase signal intensity and specificity. This resulted in transgenic lines efficient for the characterisation of TCF/β-catenin transcriptional dynamic activities during embryogenesis, including using <i>in vivo</i> imaging. Our analyses demonstrate the use of this transcriptional reporter to unveil novel aspects of Wnt signaling, thus opening new routes of investigation into the role of this pathway during amniote embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arl15 upregulates the TGFβ family signaling by promoting the assembly of the Smad-complex</a></h4>

              
                The hallmark event of the canonical transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family signaling is the assembly of the Smad-complex, consisting of the common Smad, Smad4, and phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads. How the Smad-complex is assembled and regulated is still unclear. Here, we report that active Arl15, an Arf-like small G protein, specifically binds to the MH2 domain of Smad4 and colocalizes with Smad4 at the endolysosome. The binding relieves the autoinhibition of Smad4, which is imposed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains. Activated Smad4 subsequently interacts with phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads, forming the Smad-complex. Our observations suggest that Smad4 functions as an effector and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Arl15. Assembly of the Smad-complex enhances the GAP activity of Smad4 toward Arl15, therefore dissociating Arl15 before the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Our data further demonstrate that Arl15 positively regulates the TGFβ family signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fitness consequences of outgroup conflict</a></h4>

              
                In social species across the animal kingdom, conspecific outsiders threaten the valuable resources of groups and their members. This outgroup conflict is recognised as a powerful selection pressure, but we argue that studies explicitly quantifying the fitness consequences need to be broader in scope: more attention should be paid to delayed, cumulative, and third-party fitness consequences, not just those arising immediately to group members involved in physical contests. In the first part of this review, we begin by documenting how single contests can have survival and reproductive consequences either immediately or with a delay. Then, we step beyond contests to describe fitness consequences that can also result from interactions with cues of rival presence and the general landscape of outgroup threat, and beyond single interactions to describe cumulative effects of territorial pressure and elevated outgroup-induced stress. Using examples from a range of taxa, we discuss which individuals are affected negatively and positively, considering both interaction participants and third-party group members of the same or the next generation. In the second part of the review, we provide suggestions about how to move forward. We highlight the importance of considering how different types of outgroup conflict can generate different selection pressures and of investigating variation in fitness consequences within and between species. We finish by discussing the value of theoretical modelling and long-term studies of natural populations, experimental manipulations, and meta-analyses to develop further our understanding of this crucial aspect of sociality.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural tracking of phrases in spoken language comprehension is automatic and task-dependent</a></h4>

              
                Linguistic phrases are tracked in sentences even though there is no one-to-one acoustic phrase marker in the physical signal. This phenomenon suggests an automatic tracking of abstract linguistic structure that is endogenously generated by the brain. However, all studies investigating linguistic tracking compare conditions where either relevant information at linguistic timescales is available, or where this information is absent altogether (e.g., sentences versus word lists during passive listening). It is therefore unclear whether tracking at phrasal timescales is related to the content of language, or rather, results as a consequence of attending to the timescales that happen to match behaviourally relevant information. To investigate this question, we presented participants with sentences and word lists while recording their brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants performed passive, syllable, word, and word-combination tasks corresponding to attending to four different rates: one they would naturally attend to, syllable-rates, word-rates, and phrasal-rates, respectively. We replicated overall findings of stronger phrasal-rate tracking measured with mutual information for sentences compared to word lists across the classical language network. However, in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) we found a task effect suggesting stronger phrasal-rate tracking during the word-combination task independent of the presence of linguistic structure, as well as stronger delta-band connectivity during this task. These results suggest that extracting linguistic information at phrasal rates occurs automatically with or without the presence of an additional task, but also that IFG might be important for temporal integration across various perceptual domains.

                Sequencing the regional progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) informs disease mechanisms and facilitates identification and staging of individuals at greatest risk of imminent cognitive decline, which may aid the development of early therapeutic interventions. Previous attempts to sequence neurodegeneration have analysed measures of regional volume and identified the initial sites of atrophy. However, focal microstructural alterations in white matter have also been reported in early AD. Yet, the temporal ordering of abnormality in measures of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume has not been established. In this study we used event-based modelling of disease progression (EBM) to provide a data-driven evaluation of the temporal sequence of abnormality in markers of white matter microstructure relative to grey matter volume. Regional microstructural metrics derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and regional volumes from Freesurfer cortical parcellation were obtained from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for 441 amyloid-positive participants (81 AD-dementia, 159 mild cognitive impairment, 201 cognitively normal). The estimated sequence shows a series of abnormalities in markers of white matter microstructure, followed by sequential grey matter volumetric decline, with no overlap between the two. Analysis of positional variance and cross-validation supports the robustness of our findings. These results provide the first data-driven evidence that markers of white matter microstructural degeneration precede those of cortical volumetric decline in the AD cascade. This prompts a re-evaluation of the view that regional volumetric decline can be used to characterise the very earliest stages of AD neurodegeneration. Instead, we suggest that white matter microstructural markers provide an earlier window into AD neurodegeneration. An early staging system of AD neurodegeneration based on measures of brain microstructure may find application in selecting AD subjects with early but minimal brain damage for clinical trials that aim to prevent cognitive decline.

                Natural vision is dynamic: as an animal moves, its visual input changes dramatically. How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals. This work reveals a strategy for reliable feature detection during locomotion.

                The brain's connectome continually rewires throughout the life of an organism. In this study, we sought to elucidate the operational principles of such rewiring by analyzing the functional connectomes in mouse primary motor cortex (M1) during a 14-session (day) lever-press task learning in response to an auditory cue. Specifically, we employed Calcium imaging recordings of L2/3 and L5 of M1 in awake mice to reconstruct and analyze functional connectomes across learning sessions. Our results show that L2/3 and L5 functional connectomes follow a similar learning-induced rewiring trajectory. More specifically, the connectomes rewire in a biphasic manner, where functional connectivity increases over the first few learning sessions, and then, it is gradually pruned to return to a homeostatic level of network density. We demonstrated that the increase of network connectivity in L2/3 connectomes, but not in L5, generates neuronal co-firing activity that correlates with higher motor performance (shorter cue-to-reward time), while motor performance remains relatively stable throughout the pruning phase. The results show a biphasic rewiring principle that involves the maximization of reward / performance and maintenance of network density. Finally, we demonstrated that the connectome rewiring in L2/3 is clustered around a core set of movement-associated neurons that form a highly interconnected hub in the connectomes, and that the activity of these core neurons stably encodes movement throughout learning.

                While early life drug use reliably predicts addiction liability in adulthood, the molecular mechanism by which this occurs, and the degree genetic predisposition is involved is not known. We used a unique genetic rat model of temperament to determine the impact of adolescent cocaine experience on adult psychomotor sensitization and epigenetic profiles in the striatum. Relative to adult bred low-responder (bLR) rats, bred high-responders (bHR) are more sensitive to the psychomotor-activating effects of cocaine and reinstate drug-seeking behavior more readily following prolonged cocaine exposure and a period of abstinence. We found that a 7-day sensitizing cocaine regimen (15 mg/kg/day) during either adolescence or adulthood produced psychomotor sensitization in bHRs only, while a dual cocaine exposure prevents further sensitization, suggesting limits on neuroplasticity. By contrast, adolescent cocaine in bLRs shifted their resilient phenotype, rendering them more responsive to cocaine in adulthood when initially challenged with cocaine We then assessed two functionally opposite epigenetic chromatin modifications, previously implicated in addiction liability, permissive acetylation (ac) and repressive tri-methylation (me3), on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) in four sub-regions of the striatum. In bHRs, decreased repressive histone, H3K9me3, and increased permissive histone, acH3K9, in nucleus accumbens core associated with cocaine sensitization. However, there were limits on these epigenetic changes that paralleled the behavioral limits on further sensitization. In bLRs, the combination of cocaine exposure in adolescence and adulthood, which lead to an increase in their responsiveness to a cocaine challenge, also increased acH3K9 expression in the core. Thus, adolescent cocaine experience interacts with genetic background to elicit different behavioral profiles relevant to addiction in adulthood, with concurrent modifications in the epigenetic histone profiles in the nucleus accumbens that associate with cocaine sensitization and with metaplasticity.

                Coupling neural simulators operating on different scales enhances the explanatory power of models in neuroscience. Individual regions of interest can be simulated on the cellular level to address mechanistic questions, while the remaining network is efficiently simulated on the population level. To offer this new co-simulation capability in neuroscience, we present a design template for coupling simulators which is implemented for the workflow between The Virtual Brain and NEST. The workflow is illustrated by the use case modelling the cellular-level hippocampus of the mouse embedded into a full brain network involving micro and macro electrode recordings. This new tool of simulation will allow integrating knowledge across scales in the same simulation and validate them against multiscale experiments. Moreover it will support the interrogation on the transformation between scales.

                Calcium ions serve as key intracellular signals. Local, transient increases in calcium concentrations can activate calcium sensor proteins that in turn trigger downstream effectors. In neurons, calcium transients play a central role in regulating key neuronal processes including neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. However, it is challenging to capture the molecular events associated with these localized and ephemeral calcium signals. Here we report the development of an engineered biotin ligase that combines the power of genetically encoded calcium indicators with protein proximity labeling. The enzyme, Cal-ID, biotinylates nearby proteins within minutes in response to elevated local calcium levels. The biotinylated proteins can be visualized by microscopy and identified via mass spectrometry. Cal-ID applied to mouse neurons showed increased biotinylation in active neurons, and mass spectrometry revealed active calcium signaling near Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPases. Therefore, we present Cal-ID as a biochemical recorder of calcium signaling and neuronal activity.

                Efforts to understand microglia function in health and diseases have been hindered by the lack of culture models that recapitulate in situ cellular properties. In recent years, the use of serum-free media with brain-derived growth factors (CSF1R ligands and TGF-{beta}1/2) have been favored for the maintenance of rodent microglia as they promote morphological features observed in situ. Here we study the functional and transcriptomic impacts of such media on human microglia. Media formulation had little impact on microglia transcriptome assessed by RNA sequencing which was sufficient to significantly alter microglia capacity to phagocytose myelin debris and to elicit an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide. When compared to immediately ex vivo microglia from the same donors, the addition of fetal bovine serum to culture media, but not growth factors, was found to aid in the maintenance of key signature genes including those involved in phagocytic processes. A phenotypic shift characterized by CSF1R downregulation in culture correlated with a lack of reliance on CSF1R signaling for survival. Consequently, no improvement in cell survival was observed following culture supplementation with CSF1R ligands. Our study provides better understanding of human microglia in culture, with observations that diverge from those previously made in rodent microglia.

                Purpose: To extend and optimize a non-contrast MRI technique to obtain whole head 4D (time-resolved 3D) angiographic and perfusion images from a single scan. Methods: 4D combined angiography and perfusion using radial imaging and arterial spin labeling (CAPRIA) uses pseudocontinuous labeling with a 3D golden ratio ("koosh ball") readout to continuously image the blood water as it travels through the arterial system and exchanges into the tissue. High spatial/temporal resolution angiograms and low spatial/temporal resolution perfusion images can be flexibly reconstructed from the same raw k-space data at any timepoint within the readout. A constant flip angle (CFA) and a quadratic variable flip angle (VFA) excitation schedule were optimized through simulations and tested in healthy volunteers. A conventional sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction was compared against a locally low rank (LLR) reconstruction, which leverages spatiotemporal correlations to improve reconstruction quality. Differences in image quality were assessed through split-scan repeatability. Results: The optimized VFA schedule (2-9{degrees}) reduced initial signal attenuation whilst boosting the signal at later timepoints, resulting in a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in image quality (up to 84%), particularly for the lower SNR perfusion images. The LLR reconstruction provided effective denoising without biasing the signal timecourses, significantly improving angiographic and perfusion imaging repeatability (up to 143%, p < 0.001) and enabling the clear depiction of small distal vessels and late tissue perfusion. Conclusion: 4D CAPRIA can be optimized using a VFA schedule and LLR reconstruction to yield whole head 4D angiograms and perfusion images from a single scan.

                Purpose: Magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat) is a useful marker to probe tissue macromolecular content and myelination in the brain. The increased B1+-inhomogeneity at [&ge;] 7T and significantly larger saturation pulse flip angles which are often used for postmortem studies exceed the limits where previous MTsat B1+ correction methods are applicable. Here, we develop a calibration-based correction model and procedure, and validate and evaluate it in postmortem 7T data of whole chimpanzee brains. Theory: The B1+ dependence of MTsat was investigated by varying the off-resonance saturation pulse flip angle. For the range of saturation pulse flip angles applied in typical experiments on postmortem tissue, the dependence was close to linear. A linear model with a single calibration constant C is proposed to correct bias in MTsat by mapping it to the reference value of the saturation pulse flip angle. Methods: C was estimated voxel-wise in five postmortem chimpanzee brains. Individual-based global parameters were obtained by calculating the mean C within individual specimen 15 brains and group-based global parameters by calculating the means of the individual-based global parameters across the five brains. Results: The linear calibration model described the data well, though C was not entirely independent of the underlying tissue and B1+. Individual-based and group-based global correction parameters (C = 1.2) led to visible, quantifiable reductions of B1+-biases in high resolution MTsat maps. Conclusion: The presented model and calibration approach effectively corrects for B1+ inhomogeneities in postmortem 7T data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neural determinants of abstract beauty</a></h4>

              
                Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have enquired into the neural activity which correlates with the experience of beauty aroused by abstract paintings consisting of arbitrary assemblies of lines and colours. During the imaging experiments, 18 subjects viewed and rated 120 images of abstract paintings according to how beautiful they perceived them to be. There was a low agreement on the aesthetic classification of these paintings among participants. In contrast, a re-analysis of behavioural data from our previous study on face beauty revealed a much stronger inter-subject agreement for faces compared with abstract art. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that the experience of beauty when viewing abstract paintings correlated with the emergence of decodable patterns of activity in visual areas implicated in the processing of lines and colours (V1 through V4). Additionally, a parametric univariate analysis revealed higher activity in medial frontal cortex with higher aesthetic appeal. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of the imaging experiments gave broadly similar results to those obtained in previous studies on facial beauty. With abstract art, it was the involvement of visual areas implicated in the processing of lines and colours while with faces it was of visual areas implicated in the processing of faces. Both categories of aesthetic experience correlated with increased activity in medial frontal cortex. We conclude that, as with the experience of beauty in human faces, it is fundamentally the co-operative activity in these two geographically and functionally distant areas of the brain that is the basis for the experience of beauty. Further, this co-operation is enabled by "experience dependent" functional connections, in the sense that currently the existence and high specificity of these connections can only be demonstrated during certain aesthetic experiences. This does not exclude a role in aesthetic experiences for other areas which our imaging experiments have also revealed. We also conclude that the sensory areas of the visual brain have the additional role of participating in the selection of stimuli according to certain significant configurations which make them aesthetically appealing to the observer.

                Background: Controllability is a measure of the brain's ability to orchestrate neural activity which can be quantified in terms of the properties of the brain network connectivity. Evidence from the literature suggests that aging can exert a general effect on whole-brain controllability. Mounting evidence, on the other hand, suggests that parenthood and motherhood in particular lead to long-lasting changes in brain architecture that effectively slow down brain aging. We hypothesize that parenthood might preserve brain controllability properties from aging. Methods: In a sample of 814 healthy individuals (aged 33.9 {+/-} 12.7 years, 522 females), we estimate whole-brain controllability and compare the aging effects in subjects with vs. those without children. We use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to estimate the brain structural connectome. The level of brain control is then calculated from the connectomic properties of the brain structure. Specifically, we measure the network control over many low-energy state transitions (average controllability) and the network control over difficult-to-reach states (modal controllability). Results and conclusion: In nulliparous females, whole-brain average controllability increases, and modal controllability decreases with age, a trend that we do not observe in parous females. Statistical comparison of the controllability metrics shows that modal controllability is higher and average controllability is lower in parous females compared to nulliparous females. In men, we observed the same trend, but the difference between nulliparous and parous males do not reach statistical significance. Our results provide strong evidence that parenthood contradicts aging effects on brain controllability and the effect is stronger in mothers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fine-scale measurement of the blind spot borders</a></h4>

              
                The blind spot is both a necessity and a nuisance for seeing. It is the portion of the visual field projecting to where the optic nerve crosses the retina, a region devoid of photoreceptors and hence visual input. The precise way in which vision transitions into blindness at the blind spot border is to date unknown. A chief challenge to map this transition is the incessant movement of the eye, which unavoidably smears measurements across space. In this study, we used high-resolution eye-tracking and state-of-the-art retinal stabilization to finely map the blind spot borders. Participants reported the onset of tiny high-contrast probes that were briefly flashed at precise positions around the blind spot. This method has sufficient resolution to enable mapping of blood vessels from psychophysical measurements. Our data show that, even after accounting for eye movements, the transition zones at the edges of the blind spot are considerable. On the horizontal meridian, the regions with detection rates between 80% and 20% span approximately 25% of the overall width of the blind spot. These borders also vary considerably in size across different axes. These data show that the transition from full visibility to blindness at the blind spot border is not abrupt but occurs over a broad area.

                Stem cells in the adult brain are specialized astrocytes capable of generating neurons and glial cells. While neural stem cells (NSCs) and common astrocytes have clearly distinct functions, they share highly similar transcriptome profiles. How stemness is molecularly encoded is therefore unclear. Here we use single-cell NMT-seq to simultaneously characterize the transcriptome, DNA methylome and chromatin accessibility of astrocytes and the NSC lineage in the healthy and ischemic brain. Our data reveal distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stemness is conferred by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of neurogenic genes that are expressed only later. Surprisingly, ischemic injury unlocks the stemness-methylome in common astrocytes enabling generation of neuroblasts. Furthermore, we show that oligodendrocytes employ Tet-mediated demethylation to regulate expression of myelin-related genes, many of which are abnormally methylated in multiple sclerosis. Overall, we show that DNA methylation is a promising target for regenerative medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Familiarity of Background Music Modulates the Cortical Tracking of Target Speech at the Cocktail Party</a></h4>

              
                The cocktail party problem, or how a listener perceives speech in noisy environments, is typically studied using speech (multi-talker babble) or noise maskers. However, realistic cocktail party scenarios often include background music (e.g., coffee shops, concerts). Studies investigating the effect of music on concurrent speech perception have predominantly used highly controlled synthetic music or shaped noise which do not reflect naturalistic listening environments. Behaviorally, familiar background music and songs with vocals/lyrics inhibit concurrent speech recognition. Here, we investigated the neural bases of these effects. While recording multichannel EEG, participants listened to an audiobook while popular songs (or silence) played in the background at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio. Songs were either familiar or unfamiliar to listeners and featured either vocals or isolated instrumentals from the original audio recordings. Comprehension questions probed task engagement. We used temporal response functions (TRFs) to isolate cortical tracking to the target speech envelope and analyzed neural responses around 100 ms (i.e., auditory N1 wave). We found that speech comprehension was, expectedly, impaired during background music(s) compared to silence. Target speech tracking was further hindered by the presence of vocals. When masked by familiar music, response latencies to speech were less susceptible to informational masking, suggesting concurrent neural tracking of speech was easier during music known to the listener. These differential effects of music familiarity were further exacerbated in listeners with less musical ability. Our neuroimaging results and their dependence on listening skills are consistent with early attentional gain mechanisms where familiar music is easier to tune out (listeners already know the song expectancies) and thus can allocate fewer attentional resources to the background music to better monitor concurrent speech material.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal and caudate network specificity is altered in older adults</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal and the caudate networks, defined by their intrinsic resting state functional connectivity (FC), exhibit strong network specificity. This is reflected as strong within network and weak between-network FC, as well as their dissociable roles in cognition. Aging typically reduces the specificity of brain networks. However, whether the hippocampal and caudate networks show age-related decreases in network specificity is unclear. Further, whether any age-related decreases in network specificity are due to reduced within-network FC, increased between-network FC, or some combination of both, is also unclear. Using a large-scale fMRI data set acquired from healthy younger (n = 101, aged 18 to 40 years) and older (n = 101, 55 to 75 years) adults, networks centered on the left anterior hippocampus and the head of the right caudate nucleus were compared. These sub regions were chosen based on their distinct contributions to cognition, their known interactions, and their susceptibility to age related changes. A mixed effect model was used to identify brain regions where network specificity differed between groups. For younger adults, hippocampal network specificity was strong in the medial frontal gyrus (MFG), while caudate network specificity was strong in the basal nuclei. However, network specificity in these same regions was significantly reduced in older adults. Reduced specificity in each network was due to a weakening of within-network connectivity rather than an increase in between-network connectivity. These results indicate that hippocampal and caudate network specificity decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that these reductions may contribute to age-related changes in memory.

                Experiments employing chronic monitoring of neurophysiological signals and video are commonly used in studies of epilepsy to characterize behavioral correlates of seizures. Our objective was to design a low-cost platform that enables chronic monitoring of several animals simultaneously, synchronizes bilateral local field potential and video streams in real-time, and parses recorded data into manageable file sizes. We present a hardware solution leveraging Intan and Open Ephys acquisition systems and a software solution implemented in Bonsai. The platform was tested in 48-hour continuous recordings simultaneously from multiple mice (male and female) with chronic epilepsy. To enable seizure detection and scoring, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that reads the data produced by our workflow and allows a user with no coding expertise to analyze events. Our Bonsai workflow was designed to maximize flexibility for a wide variety of experimental applications, and our use of the Open Ephys acquisition board would allow for scaling recordings up to 128 channels per animal.

                People can seamlessly integrate a vast array of information from what we see and hear in the noisy and uncertain world. However, the neural underpinnings of audiovisual integration continue to be the topic of debate. Using strict inclusion criteria, we performed activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 121 neuroimaging experiments with a total of 2,092 participants. We found that audiovisual integration is linked with the coexistence of multiple integration sites including early cortical, subcortical, and higher association areas. Although activity was consistently found within the superior temporal cortex, different portions of this cortical region were identified depending on the analytical contrast used, complexity of the stimuli, and modality within which attention was directed. The context-dependent neural activity related to audiovisual integration suggests a flexible rather than fixed neural pathway for audiovisual integration. Together, our findings highlight a flexible multiple pathways model for audiovisual integration, with superior temporal cortex as the central node in these neural assemblies.

                Luminance causes the pupillary light response (PLR), a constriction of the pupil. Surprisingly, mere illusions of brightness evoke a pupil constriction in humans. Since brightness illusions depend on scene and context, this suggests that high-level visual processing has a top-down influence onto the brainstem neurons controlling the PLR. The influence of high-level vision on this brainstem-mediated reflex is thought to be restricted to primates that perform foveal fixation. Here, we report that the same brightness illusions that evoke a pupil constriction in humans also do so in rats (N = 14). This response occurred only for stimuli that matched the spectral sensitivity of the rat retina. We recorded 32-channel cortex-wide EEG and found that illusory brightness stimuli also evoked a larger primary visual cortex event-related potential. This neural response preceded pupil constriction by ~335 msec. Thus, primary visual cortex may contribute to the PLR evoked by passive viewing of brightness illusions. Our results resolve whether this phenomenon is confined to primates by showing that it can also be found in rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproducibility of Principal and Independent Genomic Components of Brain Structure and Function</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Human brain structure and function, as measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is heritable. The genetic associations are highly polygenic and pleiotropic, complicating translation of genetic association studies to concrete biological processes. We recently proposed genomic independent component analysis (ICA) to reduce a large array of genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics into a number of more interpretable multivariate components. Here, we extend this work with genomic principal component analysis (PCA). We also estimate the inter-trait stability and test-retest reliability of genomic PCA and ICA. As a benchmark, we provide a head-to-head comparison with the reproducibility of original (i.e., raw univariate) GWAS variant effect sizes from which the components were derived. Methods: We considered summary statistics of two rounds of brain MRI GWAS in UK biobank encompassing 22,138 and 11,086 subjects and thousands of imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) retrieved from Oxford BIG-40 server. We decomposed the clumped brain-wide genome-wide matrix (n=157,893 variants and m=2,240 brain IDPs) by PCA and ICA to obtain up to 50 principal and independent genome-wide components. We tested the reproducibility of these genomic components using tail overlap coefficient and Pearson's correlation. Decompositions were repeated 20 times on randomly permuted split-half matrices to arrive at an empirical distribution of the above reproducibility metrics. As a benchmark, we also provide comparisons with the reproducibility of the original univariate GWAS effect sizes from which the components were derived. Results: The first ten principal genomic components were highly stable across trait-subsets within samples (r=0.82 {+/-} 0.15; mean {+/-} standard deviation). PCA cross-sample reproducibility dropped to r=0.16 {+/-} 0.07 (r-max=0.30) was still a substantial improvement over univariate GWAS reproducibility r=0.09 {+/-} 0.05. ICA components showed higher within-sample reproducibility at lower dimensions (ICA dimension-5: r=0.81 {+/-} 0.16 vs. ICA dimension-50: r=0.41 {+/-} 0.13). The same trend was observed for their cross-sample reproducibility, achieving an r-max of 0.27 at the lowest ICA dimension of five (average r=0.20 {+/-} 0.3) vs. r-max of 0.11 at dimension 50 (average r=0.05 {+/-} 0.02). Conclusion: Overall, the cross-sample reproducibility of PCA and ICA components are moderate, but considerably better than the reproducibility of the raw univariate GWAS effect sizes. Genomic PCA identified highly reproducible and pleiotropic genomic effects across many brain traits in just 1-3 factors. Genomic ICA captured mutually independent genome-wide effects that may be more sensitive to distinct biological pathways. As GWAS samples continue to increase and more (endo)phenotypes become available in biobanks, multi-trait genome-wide associations of the brain decomposed by ICA and PCA will likely become more reproducible and interpretable.

                The ability to view human tissue samples in 3D, with both cellular resolution and a large field of view (FOVs), can considerably improve fundamental and clinical investigations. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of light-sheet imaging of ~50 x 35 x 3 mm (i.e., ~5 cm3) sized formalin fixed human brain and up to ~40 x 35 x 5 mm (i.e. ~7 cm3) sized formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) prostate (prostatectomy) cancer samples, which have been processed with the FFPE-MASH clearing and labelling protocol. To this end, we present a light-sheet microscopy prototype, the cleared-tissue dual view Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (ct-dSPIM), capable of fast, high-resolution acquisitions, as well as cubic centimetre-scale (many cm in lateral size and up to 5 mm thick) imaging of cleared tissue in 3D. To focus on fast 3D overview scans of entire tissue samples or cubic centimetre-scale selected regions of Interest (ROIs), we explored the use of stage scanned acquisitions with slice spacing on the order of the axial resolution (i.e. light-sheet thickness) and corresponding in-plane down sampling to achieve isotropic resolution, which we term Mosaic scans. These Mosaic scans allow for fast 3D overview scans of entire tissue samples (Mosaic 16 with 16.4 microns isotropic resolution) at approx. 8-16 hrs, ~1 cm3/h, or higher resolution overviews of large, selected ROIs (Mosaic with 4.1 microns isotropic resolution) 3-4 hrs, ~1 cm3/h, speed. We were able to select and visualise ROIs around the border of human brain area V1 and V2, as well as 3D prostate morphology in human prostatectomy cancer biopsies. We show that ct-dSPIM imaging, including Mosaic scans is an excellent technique to assess entire MASH prepared large-scale human tissue samples and enable multiscale investigations and quantification (e.g. cell count) in 3D.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-dependent maximum entropy model for populations of retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The inverse Ising model is used in computational neuroscience to infer probability distributions of the synchronous activity of large neuronal populations. This method allows for finding the Boltzmann distribution with single neuron biases and pairwise interactions that maximizes the entropy and reproduces the empirical statistics of the recorded neuronal activity. Here we apply this strategy to large populations of retinal output neurons (ganglion cells) of different types, stimulated by multiple visual stimuli with their own statistics. The activity of retinal output neurons is driven by both the inputs from upstream neurons, which encode the visual information and reflect stimulus statistics, and the recurrent connections, which induce network effects. We first apply the standard inverse Ising model approach, and show that it accounts well for the system's collective behavior when the input visual stimulus has short-ranged spatial correlations, but fails for long-ranged ones. This happens because stimuli with long-ranged spatial correlations synchronize the activity of neurons over long distances. This effect cannot be accounted for by pairwise interactions, and so by the pairwise Ising model. To solve this issue, we apply a previously proposed framework that includes a temporal dependence in the single neurons biases to model how neurons are driven in time by the stimulus. Thanks to this addition, the stimulus effects are taken into account by the biases, and the pairwise interactions allow for characterizing the network effect in the population activity and for reproducing the structure of the recurrent functional connections in the retinal architecture. In particular, the inferred interactions are strong and positive only for nearby neurons of the same type. Inter-type connections are instead small and slightly negative. Therefore, the retinal architecture splits into weakly interacting subpopulations composed of strongly interacting neurons. Overall, this temporal framework fixes the problems of the standard, static, inverse Ising model and accounts for the system's collective behavior, for stimuli with either short or long-range correlations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In search of a brain microbiome: A machine learning search pipeline for electron microscopy images of brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                The healthy human brain has long been considered a sterile environment, with the blood brain barrier preventing the formation of a bacterial brain microbiome. Recent electron microscopy (EM) imaging of brain tissue has, however, provided the first preliminary evidence of bacteria in otherwise healthy brain slices. Whether due to contamination, disease, or a previously unknown relationship of bacteria to healthy brain tissue, novel tools are needed to detect and search for bacteria in nanoscale, volumetric EM images. While computer vision tools are widely used in cell segmentation and object detection problems in EM imaging, no bacteria detection tool or dataset exists. Overcoming the rarity of training data, this work presents the first pipeline for training a bacteria detection network for EM images, leveraging existing deep networks for object detection. A deployment and proofreading pipeline is presented, along with characterization of deployment to public EM image datasets. While bacteria in healthy brain tissue were not discovered in this work, this tool presents an opportunity for large scale bacteria search in EM imaging for both scientific discovery and experimental quality control, and serves more generally as a framework for sparse object detection in large imagery datasets.

                We explore neural avalanches, and the scaling relation among critical exponents, in overnight EEG recordings in human healthy subjects, during NREM sleep. Notably, the distributions of the avalanches size and duration are well described by a power law, with critical exponents in agreement with mean-field directed percolation class. Moreover, we study the correlation between the avalanches spatiotemporal structure and the sleep macro and microstructure as reflected by the CAP framework. Overall, our findings provide evidence of a link between the avalanches occurrence, slow-wave sleep dynamics, sleep stages transitions and CAP-phase A.

                Glia are essential to protecting and enabling nervous system function and a key glial function is the formation of the glial sheath around peripheral axons. Each peripheral nerve in the Drosophila larva is ensheathed by three glial layers, which structurally support and insulate the peripheral axons. How peripheral glia communicate with each other and between layers is not well established and we investigated the role of Innexins in mediating glial function in the Drosophila periphery. Of the eight Drosophila Innexins, we found two (Inx1 and Inx2) are important for peripheral glia development. In particular loss of Inx1 and Inx2 resulted in defects in the wrapping glia leading to disruption of the glia wrap. Of interest loss of Inx2 in the subperineurial glia also resulted in defects in the neighbouring wrapping glia. Inx plaques were observed between the subperineurial glia and the wrapping glia suggesting that gap junctions link these two glial cell types. We found Inx2 is key to Ca+2 pulses in the peripheral subperineurial glia but not in the wrapping glia, and we found no evidence of gap junction communication between subperineurial and wrapping glia. Rather we have clear evidence that Inx2 plays an adhesive and channel-independent role between the subperineurial and wrapping glia to ensure the integrity of the glial wrap.

                Microglia regulate multiple processes in the central nervous system, exhibiting a significant level of cellular plasticity which is facilitated by an equally dynamic transcriptional environment. While many gene networks that regulate microglial functions have been characterised, the influence of epigenetic regulators such as small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) is less well defined. We have sequenced the miRNAome and mRNAome of mouse microglia during brain development and adult homeostasis, identifying unique profiles of known and novel miRNAs. Microglia express both a consistently enriched miRNA signature as well as temporally distinctive subsets of miRNAs. We generated robust miRNA-mRNA networks related to fundamental developmental processes, in addition to networks associated with immune function and dysregulated disease states. There was no apparent influence of sex on miRNA expression. This study reveals a unique developmental trajectory of miRNA expression in microglia during critical stages of CNS development, establishing miRNAs as important modulators of microglial phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric learning of dynamic spatial regularities in visual search: facilitation of anticipated target locations, no suppression of predictable distractor locations</a></h4>

              
                Static statistical regularities in the placement of targets and salient distractors within the search display can be learned and used to optimize attentional guidance. Whether statistical learning also extends to dynamic regularities governing the placement of targets and distractors on successive trials has been less investigated. Here, we applied the same dynamic cross-trial regularity (one-step shift of the critical item in clock-/counterclockwise direction) either to the target or a distractor, and additionally varied whether the distractor was defined in a different (color) or the same dimension (shape) as the target. We found robust learning of the predicted target location: processing of the target at this (vs. a random) location was facilitated. But we found no evidence of proactive suppression of the predictable distractor location. Facilitation of the anticipated target location was associated with explicit awareness of the dynamic regularity, whereas participants showed no awareness of the distractor regularity. We propose that this asymmetry arises because, owing to the target's central role in the task set, its location is explicitly encoded in working memory, enabling the learning of dynamic regularities. In contrast, the distractor is not explicitly encoded; so, statistical learning of distractor locations is limited to static regularities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast-local and slow-global neural ensembles in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Ensembles of neurons are thought to be co-active when participating in brain computations. However, it is unclear what principles determine whether an ensemble remains localised within a single brain region, or spans multiple brain regions. To address this, we analysed electrophysiological neural population data from hundreds of neurons recorded simultaneously across nine brain regions in awake mice. At fast sub-second timescales, spike count correlations between pairs of neurons in the same brain region were stronger than for pairs of neurons spread across different brain regions. In contrast at slower timescales, within- and between-region spike count correlations were similar. Correlations between high-firing-rate neuron pairs showed a stronger dependence on timescale than low-firing-rate neuron pairs. We applied an ensemble detection algorithm to the neural correlation data and found that at fast timescales each ensemble was mostly contained within a single brain region, whereas at slower timescales ensembles spanned multiple brain regions. These results suggest that the mouse brain performs fast-local and slow-global computations in parallel.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ModelArray: a memory-efficient R package for statistical analysis of fixel data</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI is the dominant non-invasive imaging method used to characterize white matter organization in health and disease. Increasingly, fiber-specific properties within a voxel are analyzed using fixels. While tools for conducting statistical analyses of fixel data exist, currently available tools are memory intensive, difficult to scale to large datasets, and support only a limited number of statistical models. Here we introduce ModelArray, a memory-efficient R package for mass-univariate statistical analysis of fixel data. With only several lines of code, even large fixel datasets can be analyzed using a standard personal computer. At present, ModelArray supports linear models as well as generalized additive models (GAMs), which are particularly useful for studying nonlinear effects in lifespan data. Detailed memory profiling revealed that ModelArray required only limited memory even for large datasets. As an example, we applied ModelArray to fixel data derived from diffusion images acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=938). ModelArray required far less memory than existing tools and revealed anticipated nonlinear developmental effects in white matter. Moving forward, ModelArray is supported by an open-source software development model that can incorporate additional statistical models and other imaging data types. Taken together, ModelArray provides an efficient and flexible platform for statistical analysis of fixel data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noise correlations in the owl optic tectum are differentially impacted by unimodal vs crossmodal competitors</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration in mammalian superior colliculus and its avian homolog, the optic tectum, is essential for rapid orienting towards salient stimuli. The benefits of combining across modalities is expected to depend in part on interneuronal noise correlations (NCs) and trial-to-trial response variance (Fano factor; FF), yet there is scant data on these topics. Here we used multielectrode arrays (MEAs) to record simultaneously from cohorts of single units in the deep layers of the owl optic tectum (OTd). Stimuli were presented individually or simultaneously as spatially aligned or non-aligned competitors. NC values varied from -0.35 to 0.94, an unexpectedly large range, and decreased only modestly as receptive fields diverged. Spatially aligned bimodal stimuli summed in a largely additive fashion over a wide range of response magnitudes. Most of the observed variance in bimodal NCs and FFs could be accounted for by an additive rule without accounting for internal noise. For non-aligned stimuli, crossmodal competitors decreased FFs, whereas unimodal competitors did not. Most striking, visual competitors decreased NCs for auditory drivers but increased NCs for visual drivers, indicating that the OTd network is differentially wired to process bimodal competitors. In total, these data provide novel descriptive information regarding the correlational structure of OTd neurons underlying multisensory processing.

	<p>Disease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.</p>

	<p>Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 40% of OCD patients show a poor response to CBT. This study aimed to identify the cortical structural factors that predict CBT outcomes in OCD patients. A total of 56 patients with OCD received baseline structural MRI (sMRI) scanning and 14 individual CBT sessions. The linear support vector regression (SVR) models were used to identify the predictive performance of sMRI indices, including gray matter volume, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gyrification value. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; OC symptoms decreased significantly after CBT intervention (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We found the model with the comprehensive variables exhibited better performance than the models with single structural indices (MAE = 0.14, MSE = 0.03, R2 = 0.36), showing a significant correlation between the true value and the predicted value (r = 0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The results indicated that a model integrating four cortical structural features can accurately predict the effectiveness of CBT for OCD. Future models incorporating other brain indicators, including brain functional indicators, EEG indicators, neurotransmitters, etc., which might be more accurate for predicting the effectiveness of CBT for OCD, are needed.</p>

	<p>In this study, we compared the differences in brain activation associated with the different types of objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-six participants in their 20s underwent fMRI while grasping four different types of objects. After the experiment, all of the participants completed a questionnaire based on the Likert Scale, which asked them about the sensations they experienced while grasping each object (comfort, hardness, pain, ease in grasping). We investigated the relationship between brain activity and the results of the survey; characteristic brain activity for each object was correlated with the results of the questionnaire, indicating that each object produced a different sensation response in the participants. Additionally, we observed brain activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus), and the cerebellum exterior during the gripping task. Our study shows that gripping different objects produces activity in specific and distinct brain regions and suggests an &amp;amp;ldquo;action appraisal&amp;amp;rdquo; mechanism, which is considered to be the act of integrating multiple different sensory information and connecting it to actual action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe brain activity in response to tactile stimuli and motor activity simultaneously.</p>

	<p>Apathy is a neurobehavioural symptom affecting Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease patients of all disease stages. Apathy seems to be associated with a specific underlying non-motor disease subtype and reflects dysfunction of separate neural networks with distinct neurotransmitter systems. Due to the complicated neuropsychiatric aetiology of apathy, clinical assessment of this invalidating non-motor symptom remains challenging. We aim to summarize the current findings on apathy in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and highlight knowledge gaps. We will discuss the prevalence rates across the different disease stages and suggest screening tools for clinically relevant apathetic symptoms. We will approach the fundamental knowledge on the neural networks implicated in apathy in a practical manner and formulate recommendations on patient-tailored treatment. We will discuss the Park apathy phenotype in detail, shedding light on different clinical manifestations and implications for prognosis. With this review, we strive to distil the vast available theoretical knowledge into a clinical and patient-oriented perspective.</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neuropathological studies have shown that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are heterogeneous in terms of myelin/axon damage and repair as well as iron content. However, it remains a challenge to identify specific chronic lesion types, especially remyelinated lesions, in vivo in patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 3 studies: (1) a cross-sectional study in a prospective cohort of 115 patients with MS and 76 healthy controls, who underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), myelin water fraction (MWF), and neurite density index (NDI) maps. White matter (WM) lesions in QSM were classified into 5 QSM lesion types (iso-intense, hypo-intense, hyperintense, lesions with hypo-intense rims, and lesions with paramagnetic rim legions [PRLs]); (2) a longitudinal study of 40 patients with MS to study the evolution of lesions over 2 years; (3) a postmortem histopathology-QSM validation study in 3 brains of patients with MS to assess the accuracy of QSM classification to identify neuropathological lesion types in 63 WM lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, hypo- and isointense lesions showed higher mean MWF and NDI values compared to other QSM lesion types (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Further, at 2-year follow-up, hypo-/iso-intense lesions showed an increase in MWF. Postmortem analyses revealed that QSM highly accurately identifies (1) fully remyelinated areas as hypo-/iso-intense (sensitivity = 88.89% and specificity = 100%), (2) chronic inactive lesions as hyperintense (sensitivity = 71.43% and specificity = 92.00%), and (3) chronic active/smoldering lesions as PRLs (sensitivity = 92.86% and specificity = 86.36%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results provide the first evidence that it is possible to distinguish chronic MS lesions in a clinical setting, hereby supporting with new biomarkers to develop and assess remyelinating treatments. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are known to alter responses to empathic pain when used alone, however the effects of their combined use on empathy are unknown. In order to examine the effects of concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use on perspective-taking, we analyzed behavioral and neural changes on perspective-taking ability using event-related potentials. Methods: To this purpose, 13 long-term concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants users and 13 healthy controls performed a task designed to assess affective perspective-taking with simultaneous EEG recording. Results: The behavioral results revealed similar performance between groups. The neural results showed no significant differences between groups for the N170 and late positive potential (LPP) components. These results seem to suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants together does not affect perspective-taking abilities nor the processing of related information. Conclusions: The concomitant benzodiazepines and antidepressants long-term use seem to preserve the perspective-taking ability of social cognition.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people without neurologic disease and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a representative sample of the US population in which detailed information on demographic, lifestyle, routine laboratory tests, and overall health status are systematically collected. From stored serum samples, we measured sNfL levels using a novel high-throughput immunoassay (Siemens Healthineers). We evaluated the predictive capacity of 52 demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, anthropometric, or laboratory characteristics in explaining variability in sNfL levels. Predictive performance was assessed using cross-validated <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub>) and forward selection was used to obtain a set of best predictors of sNfL levels. Adjusted reference ranges were derived incorporating characteristics using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,706 NHANES participants (average age: 43.6 ± 14.8 y; 50.6% male, 35% non-white) without neurological disorders. In univariate models, age explained the most variability in sNfL (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>
<sub>cv</sub> = 26.8%). Multivariable prediction models for sNfL contained three covariates (in order of their selection): age, creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (standardized β—age: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.50; creatinine: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.22; HbA1c: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.11). Adjusted centile curves were derived incorporating identified predictors. We provide an interactive R Shiny application to translate our findings and allow other investigators to use the derived centile curves.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results will help to guide interpretation of sNfL levels as they relate to neurologic conditions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Didelphys uterus is one of the rarest Müllerian duct anomalies (MDA) of the female genital tract. Many remain undiagnosed due to possibilities of successful pregnancies and vaginal deliveries in those without or with mild forms of associated cervical and/or vaginal anomalies.  Due to this, data on didelphys uterus in pregnancy are rare, with most cases seen during routine ultrasound in pregnancies’ Caesarean section for other obstetric indications. This case was a 36-year-old G4P1+2 female who had successful vaginal delivery in her preceding pregnancy; in index pregnancy, she presented with fetal footling breech in labour and had an emergency caesarean section during which uterine didelphys was diagnosed. Many pregnant women with didelphys uterus will deliver vaginally and, as such, remain undiagnosed.  Its presence is one of the possible reasons for persistent abnormal presentations like fetal breech presentation, especially in women with prior successful vaginal deliveries. Early recognition and availability of facilities for management of such incidentally found cases of uterine didelphys will prevent many of the complications associated with pregnancy with them.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Direct Observation of Compartment-Specific Localization and Dynamics of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain enriched voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 are critical for electrical signaling in the CNS. Previous studies have extensively characterized cell-type-specific expression and electrophysiological properties of these two VGSCs and how their differences contribute to fine-tuning of neuronal excitability. However, because of a lack of reliable labeling and imaging methods, the subcellular localization and dynamics of these homologous Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 channels remain understudied. To overcome this challenge, we combined genome editing, super-resolution, and live-cell single-molecule imaging to probe subcellular composition, relative abundances, and trafficking dynamics of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 in cultured mouse and rat neurons and in male and female mouse brain. We discovered a previously uncharacterized trafficking pathway that targets Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 to the distal axon of unmyelinated neurons. This pathway uses distinct signals residing in the intracellular loop 1 between transmembrane domain I and II to suppress the retention of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 in the axon initial segment and facilitate its membrane loading at the distal axon. As mouse pyramidal neurons undergo myelination, Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 is gradually excluded from the distal axon as Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 becomes the dominant VGSC in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier. In addition, we revealed exquisite developmental regulation of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.2 and Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6 localizations in the axon initial segment and dendrites, clarifying the molecular identity of sodium channels in these subcellular compartments. Together, these results unveiled compartment-specific localizations and trafficking mechanisms for VGSCs, which could be regulated separately to modulate membrane excitability in the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Direct observation of endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels reveals a previously uncharacterized distal axon targeting mechanism and the molecular identity of sodium channels in distinct subcellular compartments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Antiseizure Drug Perampanel Is a Subunit-Selective Negative Allosteric Modulator of Kainate Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perampanel (PMP) is a third-generation antiseizure drug reported to be a potent and selective noncompetitive negative allosteric modulator of one subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), the &alpha;-amino-3-hydroxy-S-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). However, the recent structural resolution of AMPARs in complex with PMP revealed that its binding pocket is formed from residues that are largely conserved in two members of another family of iGluRs, the GluK4 and GluK5 kainate receptor (KAR) subunits. We show here that PMP inhibits both recombinant and neuronal KARs, contrary to the previous reports, and that the negative allosteric modulator (NAM) activity requires GluK5 subunits to be channel constituents. PMP inhibited heteromeric GluK1/GluK5 and GluK2/GluK5 KARs at IC<SUB>50</SUB> values comparable to that for AMPA receptors but was much less potent on homomeric GluK1 or GluK2 KARs. The auxiliary subunits Neto1 or Neto2 also made GluK2-containing KARs more sensitive to inhibition. Finally, PMP inhibited mouse neuronal KARs containing GluK5 subunits and Neto proteins in nociceptive dorsal root ganglia neurons and hippocampal mossy fiber&ndash;CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. These data suggest that clinical actions of PMP could arise from differential inhibition of AMPAR or KAR signaling and that more selective drugs might maintain antiseizure efficacy while reducing adverse effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> PMP is a regulatory approved antiseizure drug used for refractory partial-onset and generalized tonic-clonic seizures that acts as a selective negative allosteric modulator of AMPARs. Here, we demonstrate that PMP inhibits KARs, a second family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in addition to AMPARs. NAM activity on KARs required GluK5 subunits or Neto auxiliary subunits as channel constituents. KAR inhibition, therefore, could contribute to PMP antiseizure action or the adverse effects that are significant with this drug. Drug discovery aimed at more selective allosteric modulators that discriminate between AMPARs and KARs could yield next-generation drugs with improved therapeutic profiles for treatment of epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Migrating Pyramidal Neurons Require DSCAM to Bypass the Border of the Developing Cortical Plate</a></h4>

              
                <p>During mammalian neocortex development, nascent pyramidal neurons migrate along radial glial cells and overtake earlier-born neurons to terminate at the front of the developing cortical plate (CP), leading to the outward expansion of the CP border. While much has been learned about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the migration of pyramidal neurons, how migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons at the end of migration to reach their final positions remains poorly understood. Here, we report that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors during the expansion of the upper cortical layers. DSCAM is a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule. It has been linked to Down syndrome through its location on Chromosome 21 trisomy and to autism spectrum disorders through loss-of-function mutations. <I>Ex vivo</I> time-lapse imaging demonstrates that DSCAM is required for migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors, crossing the CP border to expand the upper cortical layers. In <I>DSCAM</I>-deficient cortices, migrating neurons stop prematurely under the CP border, leading to thinner upper cortical layers with higher neuronal density. We further show that DSCAM weakens cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin in the upper cortical plate, allowing migrating neurons to traverse the CP border and expand the CP. These findings suggest that DSCAM is required for proper migratory termination and final positioning of nascent pyramidal neurons, which may provide insight into brain disorders that exhibit thinner upper layers of the cerebral cortex without neuronal loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Newly born neurons in the developing mammalian neocortex migrate outward toward the cortical surface, bypassing earlier born neurons to expand the developing cortex. How migrating neurons bypass the preceding neurons and terminate at the front of the expanding cortex remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), linked to Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, is required by migrating neurons to bypass their postmigratory predecessors and terminate migration in the outwardly expanding cortical layer. Migrating neurons deficient in <I>DSCAM</I> stop prematurely, failing to expand the cortex. We further show that DSCAM likely mediates migratory termination by weakening cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Astrocytes Sustain Circadian Oscillation and Bidirectionally Determine Circadian Period, But Do Not Regulate Circadian Phase in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of mammals, generating and transmitting an internal representation of environmental time that is produced by the cell-autonomous transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) of the 10,000 neurons and 3500 glial cells. Recently, we showed that TTFL function in SCN astrocytes alone is sufficient to drive circadian timekeeping and behavior, raising questions about the respective contributions of astrocytes and neurons within the SCN circuit. We compared their relative roles in circadian timekeeping in mouse SCN explants, of either sex. Treatment with the glial-specific toxin fluorocitrate revealed a requirement for metabolically competent astrocytes for circuit-level timekeeping. Recombinase-mediated genetically complemented Cryptochrome (Cry) proteins in Cry1-deficient and/or Cry2-deficient SCNs were used to compare the influence of the TTFLs of neurons or astrocytes in the initiation of <I>de novo</I> oscillation or in pacemaking. While neurons and astrocytes both initiated <I>de novo</I> oscillation and lengthened the period equally, their kinetics were different, with astrocytes taking twice as long. Furthermore, astrocytes could shorten the period, but not as potently as neurons. Chemogenetic manipulation of Gi- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways in neurons acutely advanced or delayed the ensemble phase, respectively. In contrast, comparable manipulations in astrocytes were without effect. Thus, astrocytes can initiate SCN rhythms and bidirectionally control the SCN period, albeit with lower potency than neurons. Nevertheless, their activation does not influence the SCN phase. The emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and phase are differentially regulated: astrocytes and neurons sustain the ongoing oscillation, but its phase is determined by neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) encodes and disseminates time-of-day information to allow mammals to adapt their physiology to daily environmental cycles. Recent investigations have revealed a role for astrocytes, in addition to neurons, in the regulation of this rhythm. Using pharmacology, genetic complementation, and chemogenetics, we compared the abilities of neurons and astrocytes in determining the emergent SCN properties of high-amplitude oscillation, initiation of rhythmicity, pacemaking, and determination of phase. These findings parameterize the circadian properties of the astrocyte population in the SCN and reveal the types of circadian information that astrocytes and neurons can contribute within their heterogeneous cellular network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subthalamic Nucleus Modulation of the Pontine Nuclei and Its Targeting of the Cerebellar Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been implicated in motor and nonmotor tasks, and is an effective target of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, likely in part because of the STN's projections outside of the basal ganglia to other brain regions. While there is some evidence of a disynaptic connection between the STN and the cerebellum via the pontine nuclei (PN), how the STN modulates the activity of the neurons in the PN remains unknown. Here we addressed this question using a combination of anatomical tracings, optogenetics, and <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in both wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice of both sexes. Approximately half of recorded neurons in the PN, which were located primarily in the medial area, responded with short latency to both single pulses and trains of optogenetic stimulation of channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing STN axons in awake, head-restrained mice. Furthermore, the increase in the activity of PN neurons correlated with the strength of activation of STN axons, suggesting that the STN projections to the PN could, in principle, encode information in a graded manner. In addition, transsynaptic retrograde tracing confirmed that the STN sends disynaptic projections to the cerebellar cortex. These results suggest that the STN sends robust functional projections to the PN, which then propagate to the cerebellum, and have important implications for understanding motor control of normal conditions, and Parkinsonian symptoms, where this pathway may have a role in the therapeutic efficacy of STN deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primary excitatory nucleus in the basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus, is known to play a role in pathways modulating movement. The pontine nuclei are the main precerebellar nuclei, which transmit signals through their axonal projections to the cerebellum as mossy fibers. The pathway we have functionally characterized in this paper represents an additional cortex-independent pathway capable of relaying information between the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease suggests that this pathway could be explored as an avenue of investigation for therapeutic purposes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Muscarinic Acetylcholine M2 Receptors Regulate Lateral Habenula Neuron Activity and Control Cocaine Seeking Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral habenula (LHb) balances reward and aversion by opposing activation of brain reward nuclei and is involved in the inhibition of responding for cocaine in a model of impulsive behavior. Previously, we reported that the suppression of cocaine seeking was prevented by LHb inactivation or nonselective antagonism of LHb mAChRs. Here, we investigate mAChR subtypes mediating the effects of endogenous acetylcholine in this model of impulsive drug seeking and define cellular mechanisms in which mAChRs alter LHb neuron activity. Using <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiology, we find that LHb neurons are depolarized or hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonists oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) and carbachol (CCh), and that mAChRs inhibit synaptic GABA and glutamatergic inputs to these cells similarly in male and female rats. Synaptic effects of CCh were blocked by the M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>2</SUB>R) antagonist AFDX-116 and not by pirenzepine, an M<SUB>1</SUB>-mAChR (M<SUB>1</SUB>R) antagonist. Oxo-M-mediated depolarizing currents were also blocked by AFDX-116. Although M<SUB>2</SUB>R activation inhibited excitatory and inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, the effect on excitation was greater, suggesting a shift in excitatory-inhibitory balance toward net inhibition. Activation of VTA inhibitory inputs to LHb neurons, via channelrhodopsin-2 expression, evoked IPSCs that were inhibited by M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs. Finally, we measured LHb-dependent operant response inhibition for cocaine and found it impaired by antagonism of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs, and not M<SUB>1</SUB>Rs. In summary, we show that a cholinergic signal to LHb and activation of M<SUB>2</SUB>Rs are critical to enable inhibition of responding for cocaine, and we define cellular mechanisms through which this may occur.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain region receiving information from brain areas involved in decision-making, and its output influences motivation, reward, and movement. This interface between thoughts, emotions, and actions is how the LHb permits adaptive behavior, and LHb dysfunction is implicated in psychiatric and drug use disorders. Silencing the LHb impairs control over cocaine seeking in rats, and mAChRs are also implicated. Here, we measured cocaine seeking while blocking different mAChRs and examined mechanisms of mAChR effects on LHb neurons. M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs were necessary for control of cocaine seeking, and these receptors altered LHb neuron activity in several ways. Our study reveals that LHb M<SUB>2</SUB>-mAChRs represent a potential target for treating substance use disorders.</p>
