                arXiv:2511.20670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) model is a simplified framework that effectively characterizes neuronal electrical activity. The aim of this paper is to employ phase plane analysis to systematically investigate diverse firing patterns generated by the AdEx model under varying parametric conditions. We first introduce the fundamental equations and parameter configurations of the AdEx model to numerically simulate the six representative firing patterns in the AdEx model. And then we use phase plane analysis to explore the dynamic mechanism of these firing patterns under different input currents and parametric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns. These results not only advance the understanding of complex electrophysiological phenomena in neurons but also provide theoretical foundations for applications in many fields like neuromorphic computing and brain-computer interfaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20689">Morality in AI. A plea to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20692">The Human Brain as a Combinatorial Complex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20835">Symbiotic Brain-Machine Drawing via Visual Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are evolving from research prototypes into clinical, assistive, and performance enhancement technologies. Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20990">Meditative absorption shifts brain dynamics toward criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21605">Detecting absence: A dedicated prediction-error signal emerging in the auditory thalamus</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the brain know what is out there and what is not? Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear.
  We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit.
  These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired.

                arXiv:2511.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These intrinsically vulnerable nuclei exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogenous contributions from both primary and secondary degeneration, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.

Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.

                arXiv:2502.18710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently trained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and models -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both neuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically examining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment metric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We present a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision models and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing gaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear regression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes (rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching (unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout training further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within the first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely driven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final task solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of out-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper layers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.

Abstract: In humans and other animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

Abstract: Despite remarkable technological advances, AI systems may still benefit from biological principles, such as recurrent connectivity and energy-efficient mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from the brain, we present a biologically plausible extension of the eligibility propagation (e-prop) learning rule for recurrent spiking networks. By translating the time-driven update scheme into an event-driven one, we integrate the learning rule into a simulation platform for large-scale spiking neural networks and demonstrate its applicability to tasks such as neuromorphic MNIST. We extend the model with prominent biological features such as continuous dynamics and weight updates, strict locality, and sparse connectivity. Our results show that biologically grounded constraints can inform the design of computationally efficient AI algorithms, offering scalability to millions of neurons without compromising learning performance. This work bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience, paving the way for sustainable, biologically inspired AI systems while advancing our understanding of brain-like learning.

                arXiv:2511.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

                arXiv:2511.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

                arXiv:2511.20909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

                arXiv:2511.20987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.

                arXiv:2511.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

                arXiv:2511.13053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.

">A cholinergic mechanism orchestrating task-dependent computation across the cortex</a></h4>

              
                In an ever-changing environment, animals often need to switch between performing different tasks involving distinct sets of cognitive processes. Many such tasks involve neural activity distributed across the cortex, with dynamics that depend on both task demands and behavioral strategy. A fundamental but unanswered question is what circuit mechanisms orchestrate these task-dependent dynamics. Here, we hypothesized that acetylcholine release in the cortex plays a key role. The cortex's only long-range source of this neuromodulator is the basal forebrain cholinergic system, which targets the entire cortical sheet and can individually modulate single regions on sub-second timescales. To test our hypothesis, we first imaged cholinergic axons innervating the cortex while mice switched frequently between two navigational decision-making tasks in virtual reality (VR), only one of which required gradual accumulation of sensory evidence. We found that cholinergic input to the cortex is spatiotemporally heterogeneous and multiplexes sensory, motor, arousal, and cognitive signals in a task- and strategy-dependent fashion, with overall higher activity during evidence accumulation. Crucially, beyond contextual variables, cholinergic activity directly tracked task computations themselves, encoding an evidence-dependent decision variable only in the accumulation task. To test if acetylcholine release is causal to the performance of each task, we optogenetically silenced cholinergic terminals in the cortex while simultaneously imaging excitatory cortical activity. We found that this input is selectively required for evidence accumulation, and for large-scale cortical coding of evidence and choice during the accumulation task. Thus, we have identified a new cholinergic mechanism that orchestrates cortex-wide activity in a task-dependent manner and serves as a key node in the distributed brain network underlying the accumulation of sensory evidence.

Here we examined whether language usage shapes selective attention in bilingualism, and what neural processes might this engage. 48 highly proficient English-French bilinguals listened to naturalistic speech streams in their first or second language, paired with either linguistic and non-linguistic interference. Participants were matched on their L2 proficiency, but were either Active, Moderate, or Inactive users of their second language. The results revealed usage-related modulation of oscillatory activity in the alpha band, with more efficient inhibitory control in Active and Moderate users leading to behavioural resilience to interference. In contrast, usage did not affect lower-level perceptual tracking of speech, as captured by mTRF decoding of speech envelopes across frequency bands. Taken together, our findings show that resilience to interference during language processing is not dependent on the perceptual speech tracking, but rather on the capacity to recruit higher-level attentional control mechanisms, a process that is dynamically shaped by bilinguals L2 usage.

">Coordinated multilaminar dynamics underlie multiplexed computation in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Functional multiplexing is a signature of higher-order brain regions. Beyond single-unit mixed selectivity, the six-layered cortical microcircuit has been proposed as an optimal substrate for such parallel computations. Recurrent connections within and across layers allow cortical columns to retain incoming information for some time and integrate it into stable latent representations, thereby acting as functional units. The key question is whether the multiplexing capacity arises from specialized processing within individual layers or the collective coordination of multi-layer activity patterns. Here, we analyzed laminar recordings from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-sample task. We identified laminarly distributed, behaviorally specific subspaces that captured the encoding of distinct task-related variables. These subspaces, spanning the entire column and expressed as coordinated activity patterns, were functionally reused to encode the same variable over time and flexibly recycled to encode new ones. Subtle variations of laminar weights gave rise to multiple coexistent laminar coding subspaces, enabling multiplexing at the columnar level. Task-related information propagated across layers in temporally organized trajectories that transiently localized in superficial or deep layers at distinct trial epochs. These organized laminar trajectories were consistently observed across recording sites, but exhibited site-specific propagation patterns. The activity of the population on the other hand lacked structured dynamics. Thus, laminar trajectories of information emerged atop a background of spatially and temporally unspecific activity-fluctuations.

">Serotonin modulates nucleus accumbens circuits to suppress aggression</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) has long been considered anti-aggressive, but the mechanisms by which 5HT regulates downstream circuits to control aggression remain unclear. Combining fiber photometry, optogenetics, and miniaturized microscope recordings in double-transgenic mice, we find that 5HT levels ramp up in the nucleus accumbens during aggression, inhibiting a subset of D1 medium spiny neurons to suppress attacks. Our results reveal a novel 5HT-mediated neuromodulatory mechanism for limiting aggressive behavior.

                <p>Feeding is critical for animal survival and is tightly regulated by designated neural circuits. Several brain regions have been implicated in feeding regulation, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, parabrachial nucleus, and others. However, how these feeding regulation neurons communicate with the executors of feeding behavior, the trigeminal motor (MoV) neurons that directly control mastication muscles, is unclear. Despite its clear involvement in feeding, MoV is rarely considered as a part of the feeding neural network in literature reviews, indicating an incomplete conceptual framework of feeding regulation. Here, by using Isl1 and ChAT as neuronal markers, we genetically targeted MoV neurons to reveal its connections with other brain regions and investigated their function in feeding in mice of either sex. Notably, we identified direct connection of MoV neurons with forebrain regions including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, while hypothalamic feeding regulation neurons do not represent as a major direct regulator of MoV neurons. Functionally, although complete silencing of MoV neurons renders the mice incapable of eating, acute inhibition or activation of MoV neurons only changed microstructure of feeding behavior without influencing total food intake, suggesting that MoV neurons mainly function as the executor of feeding but are not involved in appetite regulation. Moreover, activating the GABAergic input neurons of MoV neurons generated similar effect as activating the MoV neurons, because MoV neurons are depolarized by GABA transmission. Together, we established the role of MoV neurons in feeding regulation and advanced the understanding of hindbrain feeding regulation network.</p>

                <p>Everyday auditory scenes contain overlapping sound objects, requiring attention to isolate relevant objects from irrelevant background objects. This study examined how selective attention shapes neural representations of complex sound scenes in the auditory cortex (AC). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we recorded brain activity from participants (12 males, 8 females) as they attended to a designated object in scenes comprising three overlapping sounds. Scenes were constructed in two manners: one where each object belonged to a different category (speech, animal, instrument) and another where all objects were from the same category. Attending to speech enhanced activations in lateral AC subfields, while attention to animal and instrument sounds preferentially modulated medial AC subfields, supporting models where attention modulates feature-selective neural gain in AC. Remarkably, however, spatial pattern analysis revealed that the attended object dominated the AC activation patterns of the entire scene in a manner depending on both object type and scene composition: When scene objects belonged to different categories, attention effects were dominated by category-level processing. In contrast, when all scene objects shared the same category, dominance shifted to exemplar-level processing in fields processing acoustic features. Thus, attention seems to dynamically prioritize the features offering maximal contrast within a given context, emphasizing object-specific patterns in feature-similar scenes and category-level patterns in feature-diverse scenes. Our results support models where top-down signals not only modulate gain but also affect scene decomposition and analysis&mdash;influencing stream segregation and gating of higher-level processing in a contextual manner, adapting to specific auditory environments.</p>

                <p>Sensory and perceptual processing are inherently shaped by both internal and external noise sources. While noise is typically seen as disruptive, it can, under certain conditions, enhance the detection of weak sensory signals&mdash;a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). Research on SR has primarily focused on dissimilar noise sources such as static visual noise or high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS), leaving it unclear whether different noise types produce similar enhancements or operate through shared mechanisms. Here, we investigated how three external noise sources&mdash;hf-tRNS, low-frequency tRNS (lf-tRNS), and dynamic visual noise (DVN)&mdash;affect visual contrast detection, adopting an individualized analytical approach to account for variability in internal noise across participants. DVN was specifically designed to mirror the spatiotemporal characteristics of tRNS, enabling systematic evaluation of cortical- and sensory-level noise within a unified framework. Across three experiments (<I>n</I> = 149 of either sex), all noise types improved detection performance at participant-specific optimal intensities, with the most pronounced effects observed for subthreshold stimuli and in participants with lower baseline sensitivity, consistent with a compensatory role of external noise when perceptual encoding is weak. Notably, these results provide the first evidence of SR-like benefits from lf-tRNS, challenging frequency-dependent assumptions about the efficacy of electrical noise stimulation. Comparable enhancements with DVN further establish it as a promising noninvasive tool for perceptual modulation. Together, these findings expand the SR framework by demonstrating that both electrical and sensory noise can facilitate vision and highlight the importance of individualized approaches in neuromodulation and sensory enhancement.</p>

                <p>A hallmark of mature excitatory synapses is their localization on dendritic spines, which increase in number and enlarge during development. Recent super-resolution studies have uncovered another key feature of mature synapses&mdash;an intricate synaptic nanoarchitecture. Trans-synaptic nanocolumns align AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) nanodomains with presynaptic release sites, ensuring efficient synaptic transmission as neurons mature. However, the mechanism by which these key features of synaptic maturation emerge remains unclear. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a signaling molecule implicated in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission. Recent findings show CaMKII, beyond its function as a kinase, serves as a structural element through its ability to undergo liquid&ndash;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Upon activation in vitro, it segregates AMPAR from NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR), forming biphasic condensates. Given that CaMKII expression increases during development, we hypothesized that it serves as the driving force behind synaptic maturation. Using super-resolution microscopy and primary hippocampal cultures prepared from embryonic rat pups of both sexes, we found that immature neurons, which express lower levels of CaMKII, exhibit smaller spine density and size and less-developed AMPAR and NMDAR nanodomain segregation compared with mature neurons. Remarkably, overexpressing CaMKII in immature neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the features of mature synapses, by increasing spine density, size, and receptor nanodomain segregation. Conversely, a single CaMKII mutation (I205K), which prevents LLPS, abolished these effects. Our findings support that CaMKII-mediated LLPS is the driving force shaping the mature synaptic landscape, suggesting a previously overlooked mechanistic link between dendritic spine formation, enlargement, and receptor nanodomain organization.</p>

                <p>The relationship of the brain&rsquo;s intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) during the resting state with event-related activity in response to external stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we bridge this gap by combining computational modeling with human magnetoencephalography (MEG, resting state: <I>N</I> = 64, 45 female; task state: <I>N</I> = 58, 41 female) data to investigate the relation of INTs with task-related activity, e.g., event-related fields (ERFs). Using the Jansen&ndash;Rit model, we first show that intracolumnar (and thus intraregional) excitatory and inhibitory connections (rather than interregional feedback, feedforward, and lateral connections between the columns of different regions) strongly influence both resting-state INTs and task-related ERFs. Secondly, our results demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of event-related fields (mERFs) and INTs, observed in both model simulations and empirical MEG data collected during an emotional face recognition task. Thirdly, modeling shows that the positive relationship of mERF and INT depends on intracolumnar connections through observing that the correlation between them disappears for fixed values of intracolumnar connections. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intracolumnar connections as a shared biological mechanism underlying both the resting state&rsquo;s INTs and the task state&rsquo;s event-related activity including their interplay.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an associative center that integrates various inputs to support cognition. Layer 5 pyramidal cells are themselves associative centers, as their dendrites span all cortical layers and sample multiple input streams. Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are an important mechanism for integrating synaptic inputs arriving at distinct dendritic locations. bAPs originating in the axon initial segment can depolarize the apical dendrite, activate voltage-gated currents that underlie dendritic processing and synaptic plasticity, and influence the integration of synaptic inputs arriving onto apical dendrites. How effectively bAPs depolarize apical dendrites depends on the cell type, dendritic morphology, and the dendrite's passive and active properties. Here, we found that in a unique subclass of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cell defined by D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) expression, dendritic calcium responses to bAP stimuli were far greater for a burst of APs than expected from a linear sum of single AP-evoked events in mice of either sex. D3R-expressing neurons electrophysiologically resemble intratelencephalic, D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons but morphologically resemble pyramidal tract, D2R-expressing pyramidal neurons. In both D1R- and D2R-expressing cells, burst-evoked dendritic calcium events largely reflected a linear sum of individual AP responses. In D1R neurons, this was partially due to large-/big-conductance calcium&ndash;activated potassium (BK) channels, while in D2R neurons, both BK and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide&ndash;gated channels contributed. These data demonstrate that the intrinsic dendritic excitability of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cells widely differs and suggest that nonlinear dendritic excitability in D3R-expressing neurons uniquely positions these cells within PFC circuits.</p>

                <p>Learning novel facts is central to modern life. While cortical regions involved in this process have been identified, the neural substrates underlying successful knowledge acquisition have remained elusive. In this fMRI study, we presented human participants (<I>N</I>&nbsp;= 29; 7, male) with a naturalistic learning task where 120 fictitious encyclopedic facts relating to people or places drawn from three imaginary civilizations. We then compared items that were subsequently recalled to those that were forgotten on a memory test that targeted associative learning, administered on average a day and a half later. To complement univariate analysis, we used multivariate pattern analysis to identify regions sensitive to semantic content during encoding, identifying medial precuneus, left angular gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and the lateral anterior temporal lobes (latATL) bilaterally. Within these regions, the strength of informational content within the precuneus and left latATL predicted subsequent retrieval. In contrast, planned analyses did not find univariate differences between remembered and forgotten facts. Targeted follow-up region of interest analysis indicated a possible role of response magnitude in the left inferior frontal gyrus and no univariate or multivariate effects within medial temporal lobe structures. Collectively, these results support a model of fact learning predominantly driven by the richness of representations within semantic systems that is partially distinct from episodic learning mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Synapse formation requires the accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs). At <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> larval neuromuscular junctions, a sequential process of AZ maturation is observed, with initial incorporation of early scaffolds followed by arrival of late scaffolds and VGCCs. To examine how AZ maturation regulates presynaptic output, serial imaging of AZ formation and function was performed at time-stamped synapses of male larvae expressing glutamate receptors linked to the photoconvertible protein mMaple. Quantal imaging demonstrated older synapses have higher synaptic efficacy and sustain greater release across development, while immature sites lacking VGCC accumulation supported spontaneous fusion. To examine how activity regulates AZ maturation, the effects of cell autonomous disruptions to neurotransmitter release were analyzed. Decreased synaptic transmission reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of material at existing AZs. Generation of an endogenous photoconvertible version of the AZ scaffold protein BRP revealed neuronal silencing decreased the protein's turnover. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in <I>rab3</I> mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Endogenous tagging of the Unc13B early AZ scaffold and the Unc13A late AZ scaffold revealed activity reduction decreased seeding of both early and late scaffolds, in contrast to <I>rab3</I> mutants. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation regulates presynaptic release mode and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.</p>

                <p>Discrimination of sensory stimuli is fundamentally constrained by the information encoded in neuronal responses. In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls of either sex, we found that ITD just-noticeable differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC values. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing.</p>

                <p>Propriospinal neurons play crucial roles in recovery of function after spinal cord injury. The V2a class in particular contributes significantly to recovery of locomotor and respiratory function after injury in animal models. However, V2a are a diverse class with different properties and gene expression patterns, suggesting that V2a subtypes might have disparate responses to injury. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of enriched cervical V2a neurons from adult female mice to identify specific markers of 10 V2a subtypes. We found differences in medial-lateral location as well as rostral-caudal distribution of V2a belonging to specific clusters in the adult cord. Although adult V2a can be identified as belonging to N- and Z-group divisions similarly to neonatal V2a, there is a not a 1:1 correlation between most neonatal and adult clusters. We assessed changes in gene expression in each V2a subtype 5&nbsp;d following a C2 hemisection injury. Remarkably, three subtypes of V2a neurons were found to be nearly absent ipsilateral and contralateral to injury, demonstrating that some V2a neurons are more vulnerable to changes in identity or cell loss than others. Further, the remaining V2a subtypes exhibited distinctive transcriptional alterations indicating a potential rewiring of cellular interactions within the spinal cord microenvironment. Gene expression changes common to most V2a subtypes included an upregulation of RNA splicing factors. This study reveals the diverse responses of propriospinal neurons to injury and provides a foundation for understanding changes in propriospinal neurons that may lead to adaptive (or maladaptive) changes in circuit function following injury.</p>

                <p>Converging evidence suggests that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) subregions subserve distinct roles in decision-making across a variety of tasks. Cost/benefit decisions can require an organism to choose between options based on information available in the environment (externally guided) and knowledge from experience (internally guided). Studies in humans have implicated both medial and lateral subdivisions of OFC (mOFC, lOFC) in externally and internally guided choice, yet rodent studies have primarily focused on OFC regulation of internally guided decisions. To address this gap, we examined how inactivation of these OFC subregions alters cue-guided, probabilistic decision-making using a "Blackjack" task. Male rats were required to choose between a certain, 1-pellet small reward and larger, 4-pellet reward delivered with varying probability, signaled trail-to-trial with explicit auditory stimuli indicating whether the odds of receiving the larger reward was good (50%) or poor (12.5%). Inactivation of the mOFC or lOFC induced generalized decreases or increases in large/risky choice, respectively, that were associated with opposite effects on loss (but not win) sensitivity and on rats&rsquo; likelihood of making consecutive choices of the small/certain option. Inactivation of the adjacent anterior agranular insular cortex had no effect. Inactivation of either OFC subregion also disrupted cue-guided reward magnitude discrimination, where tones signal which action delivered a deterministic larger reward, but did not affect a simpler conditional discrimination involving choice between rewarded and unrewarded actions. Together these data highlight complementary yet heterogeneous roles for different OFC regions in using discriminative stimuli to guide action toward higher-value targets.</p>

                <p>Pre-stimulus alpha oscillations in the visual cortex modulate neuronal excitability, influencing sensory processing and decision-making. While this relationship has been demonstrated mostly in detection tasks with low visibility stimuli, interpretations of such effects can be ambiguous due to biases, making it difficult to clearly distinguish between perception-related and decision-related effects. In this study, we investigated how spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha power affect iconic memory, a high-capacity, ultra-short visual memory store. Data from 49 healthy adults (34 female and 15 male) was analyzed. We employed a partial report task, where a brief display of six stimuli was followed by a report cue indicating the target stimulus. In this paradigm, accuracy at short stimulus-cue onset asynchronies (SOAs) is typically high, reflecting the initial availability of sensory information, but it rapidly declines at intermediate SOAs due to the decay of the iconic memory trace, stabilizing at a low asymptote at long SOAs, representing the limited capacity of short-term memory. Crucially, performance in this task is constrained by the temporal persistence of sensory information, not by low visibility or response bias. We found that strong pre-stimulus alpha power enhanced performance by amplifying initial stimulus availability without affecting the speed of iconic decay. This effect partially reflects stronger pre-stimulus alpha power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the to-be-reported target, likely suppressing neuronal excitability of neurons coding irrelevant stimuli. Our findings underscore the role of alpha oscillations in modulating neuronal excitability and visual perception, independent of decision-making strategies implicated in prior studies.</p>

                <p>Transducin is a heterotrimeric G-protein that is a component of the phototransduction cascade in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina. Gnat1, a rod-specific transducin &alpha;-subunit, regulates light/dark adaptation by changing its subcellular localization depending on light. Our previous study revealed that Gnat1 translocation in rod photoreceptor cells under light/dark conditions requires E3 ligase Klhl18-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Unc119, a Gnat1-binding protein. A mutation in the human <I>UNC119</I> gene is associated with cone&ndash;rod dystrophy (CRD); however, the underlying pathological mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we generated and analyzed <I>Unc119</I>-deficient (<I>Unc119<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I>) mice. We found that the retinas of <I>Unc119<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice of both sexes exhibited progressive photoreceptor degeneration, resembling CRD in humans. We also found that Unc119 interacts with Gnat2 in cone photoreceptor cells and that Unc119 is essential for the translocation of Gnat2 to the outer segment in cone photoreceptor cells. RNA-seq and subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed the predicted activation of the JAK-STAT and NF-B pathways in the <I>Unc119<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retina. Treatment of <I>Unc119<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice with curcumin, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT and NF-B pathways, suppressed inflammation and cone photoreceptor cell degeneration in <I>Unc119<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas. Furthermore, a human CRD-associated <I>UNC119</I> mutant protein competitively inhibited the interaction between UNC119 and GNAT1 or GNAT2. Taken together, the current study suggests that UNC119 dysfunction leads to CRD by affecting the JAK-STAT and NF-B pathways and may advance our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of CRD.</p>

                <p>The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) supports memory, orientation, and fear processing. The mouse RSG contains several cell types that are remarkably distinct from those found in other cortical regions, including low rheobase neurons that dominate Layer 2/3 (L2/3 LR) and similarly exclusive pyramidal cells in Layer 5a (L5a RSG). While the functions of the RSG are extensively studied in both mice and rats, it remains unknown if the transcriptomically unique cell types of the mouse RSG are evolutionarily conserved in rats. Here, we show that mouse and rat RSG contain the same unique cell types, with L2/3 LR and L5a RSG cell types together representing &gt;50% of all RSG neurons in each species. This preservation of cell types in male and female rats happens despite dramatic changes in key cell-type-specific marker genes, with the <I>Scnn1a</I> expression that selectively tags mouse L5a RSG neurons completely absent in rats. Important for Cre-driver line development, we identify alternative, cross-species genes that can be used to selectively target the cell types of the RSG in both mice and rats. Our results show that the unique cell types of the RSG are conserved across millions of years of evolution and emphasize stark species-specific differences in marker genes that need to be considered when making cell-type-specific knock-in lines across species.</p>

                <p>Signaling at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is vital for normal development of cerebral cortical circuits. These developing circuits are also shaped by fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory cortical neurons. While nicotinic dysfunction in FS neurons is implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, FS neurons are thought to not have nicotinic responses in adults. Here, we establish a timeline of FS neuron response to nicotine pre- and postsynaptically in primary somatosensory cortex in male and female rats. We found that nicotine increases the frequency of spontaneous synaptic inputs to FS neurons during the second postnatal week, and this effect persisted through development. In contrast, FS neurons in S1 had no postsynaptic responses to nicotine from as early as they can be reliably identified. This was not attributable to receptor desensitization, and we further revealed that FS neurons express abundant mRNA for several nAChR subunits, beginning early in development. To determine why FS neurons do not respond to nicotine despite expressing these receptors, we probed for the expression of lynx1, a negative nicotinic modulator. Lynx1 mRNA was expressed in FS neurons from early development, with expression increasing dramatically during the second postnatal week.</p>

While CaMKII has been considered as the primary driver of these changes, we show that transient, localized activation of Rac1 alone is sufficient to induce structural LTP in hippocampal slices prepared from rat pups of either sex. Using photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1), we demonstrated that Rac1 activation triggers spine enlargement and actin polymerization. This PA-Rac1-induced plasticity was blocked by Rac1 and Pak1 inhibitors but not by a CaMKII inhibitor. Our results identify Rac1 as an upstream of persistent signaling that stabilizes actin-based spine structural changes critical for synaptic memory encoding.</p>

Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) were utilized from baseline in 2011 to the wave six follow-up in 2020. The CHARLS cohort was assembled using a multistage probability sampling technique. Participants were comprehensively assessed through standardized questionnaires with face-to-face interviews. A total of 4,911 patients with 2,338 males (47.6%) and 2,573 females (52.4%) were included in this analysis. A significant association between the TyG&ndash;WHR and the risk of stroke was identified utilizing a Cox proportional hazards regression model with cubic spline functions that were characterized by a nonlinear relationship. The analysis determined a threshold for the TyG&ndash;WHR at 4.635. The association between the TyG&ndash;WHR and stroke was not significant [hazard ratio (HR), 0.813; 95% CI, 0.662&ndash;0.999; <I>p</I> = 0.049] to the left of the threshold. The association was statistically significant (HR, 1.271; 95% CI, 1.131&ndash;1.429; <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001) to the right of the threshold. The current study demonstrated a positive and nonlinear association between the TyG&ndash;WHR and stroke risk among middle-aged and elderly Chinese populations. When the TyG&ndash;WHR exceeded 4.635, there was a statistically significant positive correlation with the occurrence of stroke. Clinically, reducing the TyG&ndash;WHR, especially &lt;4.635, may reduce the risk of stroke.</p>

                Background Magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄) is increasingly recognized for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, making it a promising adjunct in neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care. Its pharmacological actions—such as NMDA receptor antagonism, calcium channel blockade, and modulation of inflammatory pathways—may contribute to improved patient outcomes. This systematic review evaluates current evidence on the role of MgSO₄ in neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care settings. Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect, from inception until April 18, 2025 for studies evaluating the effects of MgSO₄ in adult patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures or treated in neurocritical care. Outcomes of interest included neurological recovery, cerebral vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), postoperative opioid requirements, hemodynamic stability, and adverse events. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results Ten studies were included in this review. MgSO₄ administration was consistently associated with improved neurological recovery, as indicated by better modified Rankin Scale scores. Several trials reported a significant reduction in the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and DCI among MgSO₄-treated patients. Magnesium also demonstrated analgesic benefits, with reduced postoperative opioid requirements and pain scores. Hemodynamic stability was enhanced in the magnesium groups across multiple studies. Importantly, no significant increase in adverse events was reported, supporting the safety of MgSO₄ in this context. Conclusion This systematic review supports the potential of MgSO₄ as a safe and effective adjunct in neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care. Its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects appear to translate into meaningful clinical benefits.

                Background This study investigates gender differences in narrative writing among primary school students to promote inclusive education, as narrative writing not only demonstrates technical skills but also reflects embedded social and cultural gender norms that can influence the development of literacy and equity in classroom practice. By examining these differences, this study aims to highlight how gender stereotypes can marginalize certain narrative styles and inform pedagogical strategies to foster diverse voices in Indonesian primary schools. Methods A qualitative case study approach was used, which involved the analysis of 33 handwritten narrative documents from fifth graders (12 boys, 21 girls) in Indonesian primary schools, along with semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 selected students (5 boys, 5 girls) to explore their writing process and perceptions of gender norms. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, focusing on key dimensions such as content, organization, language use, and writing conventions; Ethical consent was obtained from the institutional review body of Universitas Buana Perjuangan (062/LPPM/UBP/2025), and informed consent was obtained in writing from parents/guardians, with verbal consent from child participants. Results The results revealed that male students’ narratives were predominantly action-oriented and linear, emphasizing independence, physical activity, and limited emotional depth, aligned with traditional masculinity norms, while female students produced stories rich in emotional expression, interpersonal relationships, and detailed settings, reflecting a more reflective and relational style associated with feminine norms; Women also show higher proficiency in organizational and writing conventions, achieving better cohesion and technical accuracy, although both genders exhibit technical errors that sometimes obscure the expressive power of their writing, revealing how gender bias can underestimate diverse forms of narrative. Conclusions These findings underscore how gender stereotypes shape literacy practices, which have the potential to perpetuate inequalities in education, and recommend the implementation of gender-sensitive assessment rubrics, cross-gender collaborative writing exercises, and teacher training on critical literacy to support an inclusive environment that validates authentic student voices and promotes equity, contributing to broader gender studies and inclusive education policies in Indonesia and Surrounding.

                English has historically played a crucial role in Indonesia’s educational framework, reflecting the country’s efforts to enhance communicative proficiency and international involvement. Since gaining independence in 1945, the English curriculum has experienced ongoing modification influenced by geopolitical changes, educational advancements, and global trends. Nonetheless, a thorough synthesis of its seven-decade evolution is still lacking. This study performs a systematic literature review (SLR) adhering to the PRISMA protocol to examine the evolution of English curriculum revisions in Indonesia from the very first character-based curriculum (1947) to the Merdeka curriculum (2022–present). Eighteen credible journal articles listed in Scopus and Google Scholar, published between 2013 and 2025, were thematically evaluated to discern historical, pedagogical, and reflective characteristics. Three principal trends were found: (1) the historical shift from character-based to competency-based frameworks, (2) the pedagogical transition from teacher-centered to communicative and student-centered methodologies, and (3) the growing significance of teacher reflection and agency in fostering curriculum innovation. The findings indicate that Indonesia’s English curriculum has developed dynamically rather than linearly, shaped by national policy objectives, global standards, and classroom conditions. The study provides a longitudinal perspective for policymakers and educators aiming to develop curricula that are culturally relevant and internationally responsive.

                Background and Objective Several studies highlight the widespread prevalence of dental health problems within the Saudi population. To effectively develop public health strategies, it is vital to assess oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours at a population level. This study aimed to examine these three domains among adults aged 18 and older residing in Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2024, involving a sample of adult visitors at shopping malls and public parks in Al-Kharj. Data were gathered using a validated, self-administered, structured questionnaire addressing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to oral health. Results The study included 367 participants aged 18 years and above. Among them, 90.2% were aware of the link between tobacco use and oral cancer, and 89.1% held favourable views regarding the use of fluoridated toothpaste to prevent cavities. However, only 55.6% brushed their teeth twice daily, and just 44.7% routinely visited a dentist. Women exhibited significantly better knowledge than men (p = 0.0001), older individuals had greater knowledge than younger ones (p = 0.004), and participants with a monthly income above 10,000 SAR scored higher on oral health knowledge (p = 0.003). Conclusion Although many respondents demonstrated good oral health knowledge, fewer than half maintained positive attitudes and practices necessary for proper oral care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1314/v1?src=rss">Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: A cross-sectional survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping various aspects of human life, including healthcare. In the Western world, AI is increasingly applied in education and clinical practice through algorithms designed to analyze health data, aid in prediction, and assist with disease diagnosis. However, developing countries like India face obstacles in adopting AI due to limited resources and socio-cultural factors. Aim This study seeks to assess and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to AI in dentistry among undergraduate and postgraduate students in South India. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional online survey was conducted among dental students in South India. The survey included 21 validated, structured, close-ended questions addressing demographic details, self-assessment of knowledge, attitudes toward AI applications in dentistry, and self-perceived understanding of AI practice in the field. Results Of 208 respondents (81.8% response rate), 95.6% were familiar with the term AI. Postgraduates demonstrated significantly greater awareness of AI applications (90.9%) compared to undergraduates (25.8%). About 78.3% of undergraduates believed AI supports diagnosis and treatment planning, while 33.4% of undergraduates and 43.2% of postgraduates expressed concern that AI may replace dentists in the future. Most respondents acknowledged AI’s role in oral radiology (UG: 79.1%; PG: 72.2%). Interest in future learning was high (UG: 82.5%; PG: 92.2%). Level of education was a significant predictor of knowledge (p<0.01), while male students showed more positive attitudes (p<0.01). First-year postgraduates reported better AI-related practices than other groups (p<0.01). Conclusion Although most dental students lacked sufficient knowledge regarding the use of AI in dentistry, they displayed positive and encouraging attitudes toward its application. A large proportion expressed willingness to learn AI technologies to apply them in clinical practice. It is therefore recommended that universities and government bodies work together to integrate AI related topics into the dental curriculum to strengthen dental education in India.

                Background Innovation in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) often stems from CEO traits and leadership. This study examines how CEO personality, transformational leadership, and innovative behavior drive innovation capabilities in Colombian MSMEs. Methods Grounded in the HEXACO model and transformational leadership theory, a mediation model was tested using data from 106 CEOs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) assessed relationships among Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, leadership, innovative behavior, and innovation capabilities. Results The model showed good fit (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.07). Openness and Conscientiousness significantly predicted transformational leadership, which in turn promoted innovative behavior. Innovative behavior enhanced firms’ innovation capabilities, confirming mediation from CEO traits through leadership to organizational outcomes. Conclusions CEO personality and leadership are key to fostering innovation in resource-constrained MSMEs. The findings extend upper-echelons theory and suggest leadership development is key to improving innovation performance in emerging-economy MSMEs.

                Background Diabetic neuropathy is one of the complications of diabetes that occurs due to poor glycemic control. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels can increase when patients are first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and can change in response to glycemic control conditions throughout the course of the disease. However, the correlation between glycemic control and BDNF remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether glycemic control can predict the BDNF levels in patients with diabetic neuropathy, based on diabetic duration. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 80 patients with diabetic neuropathy who were treated at a clinic in Central Java. We use glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels as a parameter of glycemic control, which were measured according to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. BDNF serum levels were evaluated using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method in the laboratory. Analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation and linear regression tests. Results The results of the study show that HbA1c levels in diabetic neuropathy patients with DM <5 years and ≥5 years differed significantly (9.50% vs. 8.9%, p=0.049), while BDNF levels did not differ significantly (1136.98 pg/mL vs 948.07 pg/mL, p=0.172). There is a positive correlation between HbA1c and BDNF levels in patients with a diabetic duration of at least 5 years (r=0,423, p=0,007). There is no correlation between HbA1c and BDNF levels in patients with a diabetic duration of less than 5 years. The HbA1c level was a significant predictor of BDNF serum level in patients with DM duration of at least 5 years (B=120.317, 95% CI for B: 6.103 – 234.532, p=0.039). Conclusions The HbA1c levels significantly predict BDNF levels in patients with diabetic neuropathy who have had a diabetic duration of at least 5 years.

                Background Systems operating in industrial environments are often exposed to two concurrent failure mechanisms: gradual degradation and sudden traumatic events. Maintenance decisions must account for these competing risks while controlling inspection, replacement, and failure costs. This study develops a quantitative framework to determine an economically efficient maintenance strategy under such conditions. Methods A discrete-state model is formulated with three operational conditions: Good, Degraded, and Failed. Transitions between states are driven by the system’s degradation trajectory and the occurrence of traumatic failures. A long-term expected cost model is established, incorporating inspection costs, preventive replacement costs, and failure-related losses. Dynamic programming is used to identify the policy that minimizes the expected cost per unit time. The optimisation evaluates how inspection intervals, degradation rates, and traumatic event probabilities influence replacement decisions. Results The optimisation results indicate that the cost-effective policy depends strongly on the interaction between degradation progression and the frequency of traumatic events. Higher rates of traumatic events lead to earlier preventive replacement, while intermediate degradation rates make the inspection interval the primary driver of cost reduction. The model delineates the parameter regions in which periodic inspection is justified and quantifies the cost effects of different maintenance schedules. Conclusions The proposed dynamic programming approach provides a structured method for selecting inspection and replacement strategies in systems subject to multiple failure mechanisms. The results offer decision-support guidance for maintenance planning, particularly in environments where degradation and traumatic events jointly affect system reliability and operating costs.

                <p>by Shiwei Xu, Aaron Hudson, Holly E. Janes, Georgia D. Tomaras, Margaret E. Ackerman</p>

With a goal of unveiling mechanisms by which vaccines can provide protection against HIV-1 acquisition, several studies have explored correlates of risk of HIV-1 acquisition in HVTN 505, which was a phase IIb trial conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a DNA plasmid and recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-vectored HIV vaccine regimen among individuals in the United States who were vulnerable to acquiring HIV. While this trial failed to meet its predetermined efficacy criteria, both immunological and virological correlates of reduced risk of acquisition have been reported, suggesting that at least some vaccine recipients were protected from some viruses. In this work, we describe application of a novel Positive-Unlabeled machine learning-based approach to infer protection status among vaccine recipients that did not acquire HIV, resulting in improved power to detect potential correlates of immunity. Having established the analytical robustness of protection status predictions using cross-validation and permutation testing strategies, we report increased confidence in previously identified correlates of risk, such as vaccine-elicited anti–HIV-1 Env glycoprotein IgG3 antibodies and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, and the new observation of an inverse correlation between inferred vaccine-mediated protection and virus-specific IgA responses. Though its biological validity is not established, this inference approach offers a new means to use case-control datasets to identify candidate markers of effective immune responses in the context of low vaccine efficacy.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic network structure that surrounds, supports, and influences cell behaviour. It facilitates cell communication and plays an important role in cell functions such as growth and migration. One way that cells interact with the ECM is via focal adhesions, which enable them to sense and respond to matrix mechanical properties and exert traction forces that deform it. This mechanical interplay between cells and the ECM, many aspects of which remain incompletely understood, involves the coordination of processes acting at different spatial scales and is highly influenced by the mechanical properties of the cells, ECM and focal adhesion components. To gain a better understanding of these mechanical interactions, we have developed a multiscale agent-based model based on a mechanical description of forces that simultaneously integrates the mechanosensitive regulation of focal adhesions, cytoskeleton dynamics, and ECM deformation. We use our model to quantify cell-cell communication mediated by ECM deformation and to show how this process depends on the mechanical properties of cells, the ECM fibres and the topology of the ECM network. In particular, we analyse the influence of ECM stiffness and cell contraction activity in the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and how the distinct timescales associated with different processes influence cell-ECM interaction. Our model simulations predict increased ECM deformation for stronger cell contraction and a sweet spot of ECM stiffness for the transmission of mechanical cues along its fibres. We also show how the network topology affects the ability of stiffer ECMs to transmit deformation and how it can induce cell detachment from the ECM. Finally, we demonstrate that integrating processes across different spatial and temporal scales is crucial for understanding how mechanical communication influences cell behaviour.

The genus <i>Streptomyces</i> has consistently been found enriched in drought-stressed plant root microbiomes, yet the ecological basis and functional variation underlying this enrichment at the strain and isolate level remain unclear. Using two 16S rRNA sequencing methods with different levels of taxonomic resolution, we confirmed drought-associated enrichment (DE) of <i>Streptomyces</i> in field-grown sorghum roots and identified five closely related but distinct amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to the genus with variable drought enrichment patterns. From a culture collection of sorghum root endophytes, we selected 12 <i>Streptomyces</i> isolates representing these ASVs for phenotypic and genomic characterization. Whole-genome sequencing revealed substantial variation in gene content, even among closely related isolates, and exometabolomic profiling showed distinct metabolic responses to media supplemented with drought- versus well-watered root tissue. Traits linked to drought survival, including osmotic stress tolerance, siderophore production, and carbon utilization, varied widely among isolates and were not phylogenetically conserved. Using a broader panel of 48 <i>Streptomyces</i>, we demonstrate that DE scores, determined through mono-association experiments in gnotobiotic sorghum systems, showed high variability and lacked correlation with plant growth promotion. Pangenome-wide association identified orthogroups involved in osmolyte transport (e.g., proP) and membrane biosynthesis (e.g., fabG) as positively associated with DE, though most associations lacked phylogenetic signal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that <i>Streptomyces</i> DE is not a conserved genus-level trait but is instead strain-specific and functionally heterogeneous. Furthermore, DE in the root microbiome was shown not to predict beneficial effects on plant growth. This work underscores the need to resolve functional traits at the strain level and highlights the complexity of microbe-host-environment interactions under abiotic stress.

                <p>by Celia Ferriol-González, Pilar Domingo-Calap</p>

Capsule diversity is a major limiting factor for phage host range in capsulated bacterial hosts. Phage receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) recognize the capsule and initiate infection, making them key players in phage tropism. In this study, we applied an experimental evolution approach to investigate host range adaptation in a diverse 12-phage community interacting with a <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. community containing 39 distinct capsular types. Our findings revealed that generalist phages possessed highly evolvable RBPs, accumulating non-synonymous mutations that modulated their host range. In contrast, specialist phages acquired fewer mutations but remained stable in the community, maintaining their narrow host range. Additionally, recombination between co-infecting closely related phages facilitated rapid host range adaptation through RBP swapping. However, most recombined genes encoded endonucleases or proteins of unknown function, suggesting their potential role in phage survival. This study advances our understanding of phage host range evolution and provides new insights for optimizing phage-based applications.

Intraneuronal aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau play a pivotal role in Alzheimer’s disease and several other neurodegenerative syndromes. Anti-tau antibodies can reduce pathology in mouse models of neurodegeneration and are currently being tested in humans. Here, we performed a large-scale seroepidemiological search for anti-tau IgG autoantibodies (ατ) on 40,497 human plasma samples. High-titer ατ<sup>+</sup> individuals were surprisingly prevalent, with hospital patients being three times more likely to be ατ<sup>+</sup> (EC<sub>50</sub> ≥ 2<sup>6</sup>; a nominal dilution of >1/64) than healthy blood donors (4.8% versus 1.6%). The prevalence increased with age over 70 years-old (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11–1.43, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and was higher for women (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07–1.39, <i>P</i> = 0.002). The autoantibodies bound selectively to tau, inhibited tau aggregation in vitro, and interfered with tau detection in plasma samples. No association was found between ατ autoantibodies and neurological disorders. Instead, tau autoreactivity showed a significant association with kidney and urinary disorders (adjusted RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10–1.45, <i>P</i> = 0.001 and 1.40, 95% CI 1.20–1.63, <i>P</i> < 0.001, respectively). These results suggest a previously unrecognized association between ατ autoimmunity and extraneural diseases.

The spinal cord is the key bridge between the brain and the body. However, scientific understanding of healthy spinal cord function has historically been limited because noninvasive measures of its neural activity have proven exceptionally challenging. In this work, we describe an enhanced recording and analysis approach, Electrical Spinal Imaging (ESI), to obtain noninvasive, high-resolution images of the spinal cord electrical activity in humans. ESI is analytically simple, easy to implement, and data-driven: it does not involve template-based strategies prone to produce spurious signals. Using this approach, we provide a detailed description and physiological characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the peripheral, spinal, and cortical activity elicited by somatosensory stimulation. We also demonstrate that attention modulates postsynaptic activity at spinal cord level. Our method has enabled five important insights regarding spinal cord activity. (1) We identified three distinct responses in the time domain: sP9, sN13, and sP22. (2) The sP9 is a traveling wave reflecting the afferent volley entering the spinal cord through the dorsal root. (3) In contrast, the sN13 and sP22 reflect segmental postsynaptic activity. (4) While the sP9 response is first seen on the dorsal electrodes ipsilateral to the stimulated side, the sN13 and sP22 were not lateralized with respect to the side of stimulation. (5) Unimodal attention strongly modulates the amplitude of the sP22, but not that of the sP9 and sN13 components. The proposed method offers critical insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of somatosensory processing within the spinal cord, paving the way for precise noninvasive functional monitoring of the spinal cord in basic and clinical neurophysiology.

                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify key environmental and behavioral determinants of mosquito presence in urban Mangalore, to assess community-based prevention and control measures, and to evaluate community perceptions and self-reported disease burden. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, a teaching and service field area under the Mangalore City Corporation, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results Among 95 respondents (70.5% female and 94.8% literate), 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year, 69.4% recognized the rainy season as the peak period of mosquito activity. Water stagnation [74.7% (95% CI: 64.8–83.1)] and ongoing construction activity [32.4% (95% CI: 21.8–44.1)] emerged as significant environmental determinants of higher mosquito density. A large majority of households (91.6%) reported using chemical measures for mosquito prevention, while 92.6% of participants were aware of mosquito-borne diseases and their modes of transmission. Despite this, nearly one-third (29.4%) of respondents had experienced a mosquito-borne illness in the preceding year, with 71.4% dengue infection. The use of mosquito repellents was paradoxically associated with a higher prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.4–9.6; p = 0.024). Conclusion Although awareness and preventive measure uptake were high, gaps remain in consistent environmental control and municipal interventions. Strengthening local authority action on water stagnation and construction-site management is essential for sustainable vector control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-480/v2?src=rss">How Smart Can Museums Be? The Role of Cutting-Edge Technologies in Making Modern Museums Smarter [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research on technology-mediated visitor experiences, a holistic approach to the smart museum remains underexplored. This paper addresses the gap by examining the intersection of museums and digital technologies through a cultural lens, with a focus on their role in redefining the museum experience. The concept and profile of the 21st-century smart museum were shaped through a synthesis of findings from 143 scholarly and institutional publications, combining 118 research outputs (2012–2025) across seven technological categories —Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Fusion, Blockchain, and general Digital Technologies— with a complementary body of theoretical works (1989–2025) that strengthen its conceptual and cultural foundations. From this synthesis, 15 key attributes emerged, outlining the ideal smart museum model. Anchored in theoretical and institutional frameworks, these attributes conceptualize the smart museum as a culturally embedded, technologically enhanced, and human-centered institution. The paper provides a conceptual framework and strategic guide for cultural managers, museum professionals, and designers developing smart museum practices in the digital era.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-805/v3?src=rss">Establishing the Perception of Academic Staff on Performance Monitoring in Private Chartered Universities in Western Uganda [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Effective performance monitoring is essential for improving academic productivity, especially in private higher education institutions. This study aimed to establish the perception of academic staff toward performance monitoring and how these perceptions influence academic staff performance in private chartered universities in Western Uganda. Guided by Expectancy Theory and Self-Determination Theory, the study explored how monitoring practices affect motivation and performance outcomes. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was employed. The quantitative strand involved 386 academic staff selected from five private chartered universities using stratified random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires. In the qualitative strand, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 purposively selected Deans of Faculties. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results Findings revealed that 58.2% of academic staff had a moderately positive perception of existing performance monitoring practices. Pearson correlation analysis showed a moderate positive relationship between perception of performance monitoring and academic staff performance (r = .476, p < 0.01). Regression analysis further indicated that perception of performance monitoring significantly predicted academic staff performance (β = 0.394, p = 0.000), explaining 18.7% of the variance (R2 = 0.187). Qualitative data revealed challenges such as irregular feedback, lack of transparency, and limited involvement of academic staff in developing performance indicators. Conclusions The study concludes that academic staff performance can be enhanced when performance monitoring systems are perceived as fair, transparent, and participatory. It recommends the standardization of performance evaluation procedures, improved feedback mechanisms, and the active involvement of academic staff in setting performance targets. Strengthening these areas could improve motivation, engagement, and overall academic performance in private universities across the region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-584/v3?src=rss">Service-Learning and Prosocial Competencies of Undergraduate Pre-service Teachers Toward Graduate Employability Skills [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Many graduates are discouraged about the labor market.…” because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A purposive sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101496">Specific proteolysis mediated by a p97-directed proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC)</a></h4>

              
                The p97 protein is a member of the AAA + family of ATPases. This protein is encoded by the <i>VCP</i> gene. It is a mechanoenzyme that uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to promote protein unfolding and segregation actively. The unfolded products are subsequently presented to the 26S proteasome for degradation. p97 substrate recognition is mediated by adaptors, which interact with substrates directly or indirectly through ubiquitin modifications, resulting in substrate funnelling into the central pore of the p97 hexamer and unfolding. Here, we engineered synthetic adaptors to target specific substrates to p97, using the extraordinary intracellular binding capabilities of camelid nanobodies fused to the UBX domain of the p97 adaptor protein Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1). In such a way, we created a p97-directed proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), representing a novel and unique E3 ubiquitin ligase-independent strategy to promote specific proteolysis. All functional assays were performed in human cell lines to evaluate the system's efficacy and specificity in a physiologically relevant context.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106815">SMC5/6-mediated plasmid silencing is directed by SIMC1–SLF2 and antagonized by the SV40 large T antigen</a></h4>

              
                SMC5/6 is unique among the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes in its ability to repress transcription from extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA), including viral genomes and plasmids. Previously, we showed that human SMC5/6 is regulated by two mutually exclusive subcomplexes—SIMC1–SLF2 and SLF1/2—the counterparts of yeast Nse5/6 (Oravcová et al., 2022). Notably, only SIMC1–SLF2 recruits SMC5/6 to SV40 large T antigen (LT) foci in PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), suggesting that these regulatory subcomplexes direct distinct roles of SMC5/6 on chromosomal versus ecDNA. However, their roles in plasmid repression remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SMC5/6-mediated repression of plasmid transcription depends exclusively on SIMC1–SLF2, whereas SLF1/2 is dispensable. Reinforcing its specialized role in ecDNA suppression, SIMC1–SLF2 does not participate in SMC5/6 recruitment to chromosomal DNA lesions. We further show that plasmid silencing requires a conserved interaction between SIMC1–SLF2 and SMC6, mirroring the functional relationship observed between yeast Nse5/6 and Smc6. As for viral silencing, plasmid repression depends on the SUMO pathway; however, unlike viral silencing, it does not require PML NBs. Additionally, we find that LT interacts with SMC5/6 and increases plasmid transcription to levels observed in SIMC1–SLF2-deficient cells—echoing the antagonistic roles of HBx (HBV) and Vpr (HIV-1) in viral genome repression. These findings expand the paradigm of viral antagonism against SMC5/6-mediated silencing, positioning LT as a novel player in this evolutionary tug-of-war.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105541">The RAB27A effector SYTL5 regulates mitophagy and mitochondrial metabolism</a></h4>

              
                SYTL5 is a member of the Synaptotagmin-Like (SYTL) protein family that differs from the Synaptotagmin family by having a unique N-terminal Synaptotagmin homology domain that directly interacts with the small GTPase RAB27A. Several SYTL protein family members have been implicated in plasma membrane transport and exocytosis, but the specific function of SYTL5 remains unknown. We here show that SYTL5 is a RAB27A effector and that both proteins localise to mitochondria and vesicles containing mitochondrial material. Mitochondrial recruitment of SYTL5 depends on its interaction with functional RAB27A. We demonstrate that SYTL5-RAB27A positive vesicles containing mitochondrial material, autophagy proteins and LAMP1 form during hypoxia and that depletion of SYTL5 and RAB27A reduces mitophagy under hypoxia mimicking conditions, indicating a role for these proteins in mitophagy. Indeed, we find that SYTL5 interacts with proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport and cellular response to stress and that its depletion compromises mitochondrial respiration and increases glucose uptake. Intriguingly, SYTL5 expression is significantly reduced in tumours of the adrenal gland and correlates positively with survival for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100653">Prosapip1 (encoded by the Lzts3 gene) in the dorsal hippocampus mediates synaptic protein composition, long-term potentiation, and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                 Prosapip1 is a brain-specific protein, encoded by <i>Lzts3</i>, localized to the postsynaptic density, where it promotes dendritic spine maturation in primary hippocampal neurons. However, nothing is known about the role of Prosapip1 in vivo. To examine this, we utilized the Cre-loxP system to develop a Prosapip1 neuronal knockout mouse. We found that Prosapip1 controls the synaptic localization of its binding partner SPAR, along with PSD-95 and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in the dorsal hippocampus (dHP). We next sought to identify the potential contribution of Prosapip1 to the activity and function of the NMDAR and found that Prosapip1 plays an important role in NMDAR-mediated transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the dHP. As LTP is the cellular hallmark of learning and memory, we examined the consequences of neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 on dHP-dependent memory. We found that global or dHP-specific neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 caused a deficit in learning and memor,y whereas developmental, locomotor, and anxiety phenotypes were normal. Taken together, Prosapip1 in the dHP promotes the proper localization of synaptic proteins which, in turn, facilitates LTP driving recognition, social, and spatial learning and memory.

">Enhanced pitch perception in early blind individuals and musicians is due to reduced internal noise</a></h4>

              
                Although it is commonly assumed that early blind individuals have enhanced pitch perception, the literature to date has been contradictory. We measured performance in two tasks known to recruit early vs. late stages of auditory frequency tuning in early blind and sighted individuals with matched levels of musical training. The two groups showed equivalent performance on a tone detection in a notched-noise task that assesses peripheral and subcortical frequency selectivity. In contrast, early blind individuals showed enhanced performance in a pitch discrimination task thought to be mediated by cortical mechanisms. Computational modeling revealed that this enhancement was best explained by reduced internal noise rather than narrower frequency tuning, with both blindness and musical training predicting a reduction in internal noise. These findings identify internal noise as a key factor in experience-driven auditory plasticity as a result of both musical experience and early blindness.

">Early Arousal Signals Drive Reward Learning and Subsequent Choice Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Learning to reinforce rewarding actions and avoid repeated mistakes is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Yet, it remains unclear how distinct neural signals coordinate to implement reward-based decision-making and behavioural adjustment. We obtained simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry during a probabilistic reversal learning task. Leveraging single-trial EEG, we first replicate the presence of two feedback-locked neural representations; an early signal previously linked to alertness and switching behaviours following negative feedback and a late signal associated with value updating and reward learning. Using single-trial pupillometry, we then show that differences in feedback-evoked pupil responses between positive and negative feedback are driven primarily by negative feedback encoding. Jointly examining these EEG and pupillometry signatures, we show that following negative feedback, increased trial-by-trial coupling between the pupil response and the early, but not the late, EEG signal is linked to increased uncertainty and exploration tendency as well as reduced accuracy and evidence accumulation on the next trial. Consistent with previous research implicating the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline system in uncertainty signalling and network resets, we propose that when internal estimates of contextual uncertainty are high following negative feedback, an early signal, likely regulated by locus coeruleus activity, implements a network reset in reward learning structures of a later learning signal. This interruption may simultaneously increase the neural gain related to the processing of novel information and decrease the influence of existing representations in reward learning structures, in turn improving performance by creating new, more accurate internal representations of the external world.

">A flexible coding scheme underlying working memory generalization in human parietal and frontal cortices</a></h4>

              
                Humans can rapidly extract abstract, common knowledge from distinct experiences, enabling generalization of this knowledge across tasks within working memory (WM) to guide behavior. Although task-specific representations of WM have been observed in a distributed network encompassing sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices, whether these regions construct task-generalizable representations and whether such representations can be dynamically shaped by task demands remain unclear. Across two functional MRI experiments, we investigated WM generalization across distinct WM tasks (location and object tasks) based on shared underlying task structures. Trial-specific task demands varied between passive maintenance and active, rule-guided manipulation of mnemonic stimuli. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) demonstrated task-generalizable stimulus representations during both maintenance and manipulation. In contrast, the lateral (LFC) and medial (MFC) frontal cortices supported manipulation- and maintenance-based generalization, respectively. Critically, manipulation-based generalization in the PPC and LFC emerged even when participants did not explicitly learn the mapping between task spaces, indicating that active exploration of task structure can spontaneously facilitate generalization across tasks. Together, these findings reveal that flexible generalization for goal-directed behavior is achieved via a distributed WM network, with distinct regions serving active versus passive task demands.

">Ventral Hippocampal Temporoammonic and Schaffer Collateral Pathways Differentially Control Fear- and Anxiety-Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The ventral hippocampus plays a crucial role in regulating anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Previously, we demonstrated that diazepam reduces anxiety-like behavior by inhibiting the dentate gyrus and CA3 principal neurons via 2-GABAARs, while inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is necessary to suppress fear-related responses. This study investigated the role of inputs from ventral CA3 (vCA3) and entorhinal cortex to ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anxiety- and fear-like behavior using bidirectional optogenetic modulations. Adult C57BL/6J male and female mice were subjected to bilateral stereotaxic injection of a viral vector expressing channelrhodopsin or halorhodopsin into vCA3 or into layers II-III of lateral entorhinal cortex, followed by bilateral implantation of fiberoptic ferrules into vCA1. After four weeks of recovery, mice were assessed for anxiety-like behavior in the novel open field, elevated plus maze, and Vogel conflict tests, and by contextual and trace fear conditioning for fear. The behavior of the mice was recorded under laser  ON and  OFF conditions in all experiments. The activation of vCA3 to vCA1 projections (i.e., Schaffer collateral pathway) increased anxiety- and fear-related behaviors, whereas inhibition reduced such behaviors. In contrast, optogenetic activation or inhibition of EC to vCA1 projections (i.e., temporoammonic pathway) had no effect on anxiety-related behavior but positively or negatively modulated fear-related behavior, respectively. These results suggest that while fear-related behavior is modulated by both inputs to vCA1, modulation of anxiety-related behavior is input-specific for the vCA3 to vCA1 projection. In summary, this study offers mechanistic insights into the complex organization of hippocampal circuitry underlying fear and anxiety.

">Dynamic brain states during encoding and their post-encoding reinstatement predicts episodic memory in children</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory, the ability to rapidly learn and explicitly remember past events and experiences, plays a critical role in childrens academic learning and knowledge acquisition. The formation of lasting memories relies on the brain's ability to dynamically organize its activity. How these neural configurations unfold moment-by-moment across encoding and offline phases remains poorly understood. To probe these dynamics, we applied a novel Bayesian Switching Dynamic Systems approach, a hidden Markov model with automatic state detection, to fMRI data from children performing scene encoding followed by an offline post-encoding rest. We identified four distinct brain states during encoding with unique activation modes between visual, medial temporal lobe, and frontoparietal and default mode network nodes. An "active-encoding" state with integrated visual-hippocampal and frontoparietal activity dominated encoding and predicted individual memory performance, while an inactive state negatively predicted performance. State transition dynamics revealed that flexible shifts into the active-encoding state enhanced memory formation, whereas transitions toward inactive states impaired it, demonstrating that memory success depends on dynamic neural flexibility. Critically, encoding states spontaneously reemerged during post-encoding rest. A "default-mode" state characterized by enhanced default mode network activity showed sustained maintenance during rest and robustly predicted memory outcomes, an effect specific to post-encoding, not pre-encoding rest. These findings establish that episodic memory emerges from coordinated brain state sequences bridging online encoding with offline consolidation, providing a computational framework for how moment-to-moment neural dynamics support memory formation in children. This work has broad implications for optimizing educational interventions and understanding developmental disorders affecting learning and memory.

">Inferential planning in the frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                How the brain plans and maintains sequences of future actions remains a central question in systems neuroscience. Recent studies in the frontal cortex have revealed that multiple elements of a sequence are represented simultaneously in separable neural subspaces, challenging classical serial models of sequential planning. Here, we show that these representations emerge naturally under inferential planning in which sequential actions are inferred from sensory evidence and goals. Using a hierarchical generative model, we reproduce key neural phenomena observed in primate frontal cortex, including the simultaneous activation of multiple plan elements, the emergence of (almost) orthogonal `memory' subspaces, and their reuse across forward and backward sequence tasks. Our approach provides a mechanistic account of how probabilistic inference over control states gives rise to distributed and dynamic neural representations of plans. This framework not only unifies previously disparate findings on planning, working memory, and motor preparation, but also generates novel, testable predictions about the dynamics of active inference, the role of sensory subspaces, and the impact of uncertainty on sequence processing.

">Decoding the neural stages from action and object recognition to mentalizing</a></h4>

              
                Higher-level action interpretation, such as inferring underlying intentions and predicting future actions, requires the integration of conceptual action information (e.g. "opening") with semantic knowledge about persons and objects (e.g. "my friend Anna", "pizza box"). However, how the neural systems for action and object recognition and memory interact with each other to form the basis for inferring higher-level mental states remains unclear. Here we use fMRI-based crossmodal multiple regression representational similarity analysis in human female and male participants to elucidate the processing stages from basic action and object recognition to mentalizing. We show that inferring intentions from observed actions or written sentences involves a modality-general network of lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal brain regions associated with conceptual action and object representation and mentalizing. The representational profiles in these regions are explained by models capturing different types of conceptual information, revealing distinct but partially overlapping networks for action, object, and mental state representation. There was no strict separation of networks for action, object, and mental state representations, arguing against a sequential bottom-up hierarchy from action and object understanding pathways to the mentalizing network. Rather, left-hemispheric regions, specifically ventrolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior lateral occipitotemporal cortex, showed strong representational overlap, pointing towards a core network for making meaning of action-object structures at a conceptual level. We argue that this core network represents a distributional semantic hub between classic networks for action and object understanding and the mentalizing network.

">In search for the invisible: motor inhibition in monkey premotor cortex and its RNN replicas</a></h4>

              
                Controlling actions in dynamically changing environments requires flexible and efficient motor control. A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to uncover how cortical circuits generate, adjust, and sometimes suppress planned movements. To address this, we combined recordings from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of macaque monkeys performing a stop-signal task, with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model inferred directly from multi-unit activity. This data-driven "digital twin" reproduced the cortical population dynamics underlying motor planning and inhibition, revealing how internal network states shape behavior, and generating synthetic neural trajectories for unseen conditions. RNN internal state explained reaction time fluctuations across trials, reflecting stochastic components of motor readiness and endogenous variability of PMd activity. The same pre-Go latent state also constrained movement inhibition modulating the network's response to Stop signals by reshaping the attractor dynamics of a null-potent subspace. These results establish a mechanistic link between latent cortical dynamics and flexible behavioral control, demonstrating how autonomous RNN inference can uncover circuit-level computations.

">Injury-Induced Remodeling of Junctional Actin Bands in the Vestibular Maculae of Mice and Chicks: Implications for Sensory Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular organs of birds are capable of regenerating sensory hair cells after ototoxic injury, but the regenerative ability of the mammalian vestibular organs is much more limited. The factors that inhibit regeneration in the mammalian inner ear are not known, but it has been proposed that the structure of filamentous actin cables at cell-cell junctions within the sensory epithelium may be an important regulatory influence. Junctional actin cables in the chick utricle are relatively thin, while those in mouse utricle are much thicker. These differences result in differing mechanical properties of the avian vs. mammalian inner ear, which may affect the potential for regenerative proliferation. The present study characterized injury-evoked changes in junctional actin cables in the utricles of mice and chicks. We found that the thickness of junctional cables in the chick utricle was not affected by ototoxic injury, but that injury to the mouse utricle led to the formation of many new junctional actin bands whose thickness was comparable to those in the chick utricle. Thicker actin bands persisted after injury, but were not necessarily associated with cellular junctions. In addition, the relative extent of supporting cell expansion in the injured chick utricle was larger than that in the mouse utricle, which may affect activation of Hippo/YAP signaling in both species. Together, these data point to important differences in actin cable plasticity in the avian vs. mammalian utricle that may partially account for their differing regenerative abilities.

">Glomerulus-specific inhomogeneity of the basal activity map in the olfactory bulb supports olfactory-driven behavior</a></h4>

              
                Glomeruli are signal-processing units of the olfactory bulb (OB), playing a key role in many OB computations, including contrast enhancement, gain control, and odorant-selective habituation. In awake mice, we uncover an extremely stable inhomogeneous map of basal glomerulus-specific activity as a background against which olfactory signal processing is performed. This activity is strongly driven by (i) centrifugal cholinergic projections, (ii) endogenous, and (iii) airflow-evoked spiking of olfactory sensory neurons and, to a small extent, (iv) by the odor environment. Importantly, early olfactory impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease is parallelled by the loss of glomerular map inhomogeneity and diminished cholinergic innervation. These results reveal an important layer in the signal-processing network of the OB, likely acting by increasing the variance in and dynamic range of the system via glomerulus-specific functional inhomogeneity.

">Shared feedback control principles across standing and walking</a></h4>

              
                Feedback control is required to maintain stability in both walking and standing, whereas the control parameters may differ due to the inherently different characteristics of these tasks. How feedback is adapted between tasks is unclear. To address this, we applied a unified feedback model, relating preceding center of mass position and velocity information to corrective ground reaction forces, to estimate and compare the control parameters between walking and standing. 15 healthy young participants (21+/- 4 yrs, 63 +/- 9 kg, 1.70 +/- 0.10 m, 13 females, 2 males) participated, they walked at 4.5 km/h for 5 minutes, and performed 3 different standing tasks: normal standing, unipedal standing, and step posture for 1 minute, repeated 5 times. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and used to fit the feedback model and estimate feedback delay and gains. Results showed good model fits for both walking and standing with mean R2-values higher than 0.69. The feedback delay was significantly longer in walking than in standing. While the feedback position gains and velocity gains varied significantly across tasks and directions, position gains were mostly above critical stiffness and velocity gains all at under-damped level, with as only exception that position gains in the AP direction in walking, which were slightly below critical stiffness. The ratio of position to velocity gains in all tasks remained consistently close to the eigenfrequency (sqrt(g/l)) as predicted by the extrapolated center of mass concept. Our findings suggest a robust control strategy in which the sensorimotor system maintains a relative consistent weighting between position and velocity feedback for walking and standing.

">Quantitative phosphoproteomics uncovers the signalling dynamics of hallucinogenic psychedelics</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic drugs can induce intense changes in perception and thought, and some also promote long-lasting adaptations in brain circuits that are being explored for treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. How these compounds differ at the level of intracellular signalling, and how hallucinogenic drugs diverge from related non-hallucinogenic forms, is poorly understood. A central question is whether a shared molecular fingerprint distinguishes hallucinogenic psychedelic action from other forms of receptor activation in neurons. Here, we show that chemically diverse psychedelics trigger a coordinated reorganisation of phosphorylation patterns across many proteins in neural cells, and that this global signalling response contains a distinct signature that separates hallucinogenic compounds from non-hallucinogenic counterparts of similar structure. We use a glycolysis-regulating transcription factor as an example of the signature functional relevance to show that hallucinogenic psychedelics, but not their non-hallucinogenic analogues, enhance markers of glycolytic metabolism. These findings reveal that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic psychedelics engage separable intracellular architectures, and establish a framework for understanding how different psychoactive compounds couple receptor activation to specific cellular states. More broadly, this work opens a path to using signalling fingerprints to guide the design of psychedelic-inspired therapeutics with tailored behavioural and metabolic profiles.

                Under homeostatic conditions, axons of the central nervous system (CNS) are myelinated by oligodendrocytes. However, in response to demyelination, Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), can contribute to CNS remyelination. Lineage tracing studies demonstrated that many CNS remyelinating SCs, in addition to remyelinating oligodendrocytes, are derived from adult CNS stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here we describe the mechanisms by which the fate switch of neuroepithelial-derived OPCs into SCs, a cell normally of neural crest origin, occurs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing we identified a subpopulation of OPCs within demyelinating lesions that co-express SC markers. Within this SC-primed group, differential gene analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in integrin signalling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activation. We found that BMP4 and vitronectin, an extracellular matrix molecule and integrin ligand, are sufficient external cues to induce SC differentiation by OPCs by directly exerting effects on the transcription factors OLIG2 and SOX10, which are critical regulators of cell fate in oligodendroglial cells and SCs. We also show that OPCs can be directly programmed toward a SC fate by suppressing the expression levels of Olig2 and while maintaining those of Sox10. OPC-derived SCs morphologically and transcriptionally resemble primary SCs and can myelinate CNS axons with peripheral type myelin. Our findings indicate that injury-related changes in the environment can destabilise oligodendroglial transcription factor networks, enabling alternative OPC fate choices during CNS remyelination.

">A mouse model of classical trigeminal neuralgia via intradural compression of the trigeminal nerve</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a debilitating orofacial pain condition that adversely affects quality of life. Although heterogeneous, the most common form of TN is classical TN, characterized by paroxysmal bouts of pain in response to otherwise innocuous stimuli. It is believed that classical TN results from neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. However, the underlying pathophysiology of TN is not well understood, thus limiting the development of targeted therapies. Current animal models lack translational relevance, particularly in their inability to replicate intradural nerve root compression, a core anatomic component of TN. Methods: We developed a TN mouse model that achieves intradural nerve root compression via a retro-orbital approach confirmed by anatomic dissection and magnetic resonance imaging. To assess behavioral outcomes, we measured orofacial pain through facial wiping and interaction with a reward stimulus. Pharmacological responsiveness was tested using carbamazepine administration. Mechanistic studies included calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia (TG), electrophysiologic recordings to measure resting membrane potential and rheobase, and immunohistochemical analysis of the TG. Results: The model elicited orofacial neuropathic pain, substantiated by increased facial wiping and reduced interaction with a reward stimulus, behaviors that suggest both spontaneous and evoked pain. Carbamazepine attenuated these behaviors, suggesting pharmacologic relevance to current TN treatment. Calcium imaging showed heightened spontaneous activity in the TG, and electrophysiologic recordings revealed an increased resting membrane potential and a reduced rheobase. Finally, immunohistochemical studies showed infiltration of CD45+ cells, demyelination and an increase in CGRP expression in the TG, supporting the presence of neuroinflammation after nerve root compression.

">Fus depleted oligodendrocytes reduce neuronal damage and attenuate AD progression in the AppNL-G-F mouse</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes (OL) and myelin abnormalities have emerged as important contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD). OL maintain neuronal health through myelin axon interactions and by supplying neurotrophic and metabolic support. To gain insight on how OL and myelin may improve neuronal deficits associated with AD, we have generated a novel mouse model (AD/cKO) by crossing the AppNL-G-F mouse which carries three human AD mutations in the mouse App gene with the FusOLcKO which has thicker myelin associated with greater cholesterol biosynthesis. The spatial working memory deficits manifested by the aged AD mouse were fully rescued by the FusOLcKO. This outcome was associated with reduced neuronal oxidative damage, preserved presynaptic structures at the plaque niches and a shift in microglia state at the niches in both hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, plaque burden and microglia density were decreased in the hippocampus but not in cortex, uncoupling the neuronal and microglia effects from the amyloid burden. Single cell transcriptomics of AD/cKO hippocampal OL revealed upregulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant genes, suggesting a role of OL enhanced energy metabolism in protecting neurons and affecting microglia state in AD pathology.

">Contralesional activity reflects compensation, while brainstem detour pathways support skilled motor recovery after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Large strokes frequently result in lasting motor deficits and trigger extensive reorganization within the brain and spinal cord. Altered neuronal activity in the contralesional hemisphere has been documented in both humans and rodent models, yet its role in functional recovery versus maladaptation remains unresolved. Here, we used chronic wide-field calcium imaging to monitor bilateral cortical activity in mice performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task before and days to weeks after stroke. Strokes produced persistent fine motor impairments, which were only partly alleviated by intensive rehabilitative training. While cortical activity was in particular suppressed in the ipsilesional cortex after stroke, training promoted sustained increases in contralesional sensorimotor activity. However, ridge regression analysis of neural and behavioral data indicated that this activity largely reflected compensatory use of the intact paw rather than recovery of the impaired forelimb. Axonal tracing nevertheless revealed enhanced projections from contralesional motor cortex to ipsilesional brainstem nuclei - including the midbrain and pontine reticular nucleus - specifically in trained animals. These findings identify a rehabilitation-induced corticofugal pathway supporting motor recovery, highlighting a target for neuromodulation strategies in chronic post-stroke impairment.

">Parabrachial Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Neurons Sex-Specifically Modulate Anxiety in Alcohol Withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                Parabrachial nucleus (PBN) neurons expressing Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) modulate fear- and anxiety-like behavior. It is unknown if PBN(CGRP) neurons play a role in anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol or after repeated stress. First, to investigate the anxiogenic role of activating PBN(CGRP) neurons in naive conditions, CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in the PBN were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM). PBN(CGRP) neurons drive phasic activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that synchronizes to anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, a transsynaptic anterograde AAV-based strategy was used in C57BL/6J female and male mice to activate BNST neurons innervated by the PBN projections (BNSTPBN) during EPM. Additionally, PBN(CGRP) neurons and CGRP-innervated BNST cells were measured in experimentally-naive CGRP-DTRGFP female and male mice, to investigate baseline sex-differences. Next, to investigate the impact of PBN(CGRP) inhibition on anxiety-like behavior following chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE), CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM4D(Gi) DREADDs in the PBN were tested in EPM during acute withdrawal. Additionally, mice were exposed to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) paired with PBN(CGRP) inhibition followed by testing in the novelty suppressed feeding task (NSFT), to investigate the role of PBN(CGRP) on anxiety-like behavior after stress in prolonged withdrawal. Activating PBN(CGRP) or BNSTPBN neurons did not change behavior in EPM in either sex. Total PBN(CGRP) and CGRP-innervated BNST cells did not differ between females and males. In acute withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons decreased time in the open arm and increased time in the closed arm selectively in females. In prolonged withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons during FSS did not affect immobility in either sex, but did subsequently decrease approach frequency and average speed selectively in males. Altogether, the data report the anxiogenic effect of manipulating PBN(CGRP) neurons is stress and sex-specific during alcohol withdrawal.

">Absence of Local Retinotopy in the Mouse Optic Tract</a></h4>

              
                Retinotopy is a fundamental organizational principle of the visual system, where neighboring neurons represent adjacent points in visual space. This spatial relationship is established by precise anatomical wiring across successive areas, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex. To examine the precision of this topographic arrangement within the long-range projection axons themselves, we recorded retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mouse optic tract (OT) and mapped their receptive fields (RFs). As expected for a retinotopically organized area, we found that nearby LGN cell pairs had significantly smaller RF distances than distant pairs. In contrast, no such relationship was observed among RGC axons in the OT. Modelling analyses further confirmed that the observed RF distances in the OT were incompatible with any locally retinotopic arrangement. Instead, the OT retained only coarse topography, with ~20 degrees RF deviations or ~45 m axonal displacements from an ideal retinotopic organization. These results demonstrate that the mouse OT lacks fine-scale retinotopy and maintains only broad topographic structure.

">Accurate evaluation of neural sensitivity to weak alternating electric fields requires protocols accounting for input dependence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Weak alternating electric fields (~1 V/m) modulate nervous system activity. Yet, the exact mechanism by which such low amplitude electric fields can modulate neural activity is still unknown despite the use of specific protocols aiming at quantifying neural sensitivity. Objective: To characterize how the measurement protocol can impact neural sensitivity to weak electric fields and bias in vivo sensitivity. Methods: We considered a variety of somatic clamp stimulation to drive the activity of biophysical morpho-realistic reconstructed neurons during extracellular alternating stimulation to quantify the sensitivity to the field depending on the nature of cells' activity. Results: Cells sensitivity to alternating current stimulation depended on the type of input used to drive their activity, with a different frequency response for each protocol, with a trend for inhibitory neurons to be more sensitive to higher stimulation frequencies. Even with the same clamp protocol, sensitivity depended on the statistics of the input used. Significance: Neuronal sensitivity to alternating current stimulation is highly input-dependent, which has been largely neglected so far, and depends on the current statistic of the received inputs, and is not reliably represented by simple current clamps protocols.

">Intrabody-guided synapse proteomics defines pyramidal neuron input architecture and uncovers early remodeling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Across their proximal and distal dendritic domains, pyramidal neurons (PNs) integrate inputs that differ in morphology and function. Hippocampal CA1 PNs are among the earliest affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular composition of their inputs and selective vulnerability remain poorly defined. We develop an intrabody-guided proximity-labeling strategy that targets the biotin ligase TurboID to endogenous postsynaptic scaffolds for cell-autonomous mapping of postsynaptic proteomes. Targeting PSD95 or Homer1 enables selective labeling of excitatory postsynaptic proteins in mouse CA1 PNs and resolves subsynaptic organization by comparing the two probes. Mapping the proteomes of major CA1 inputs uncovers a proximal-distal molecular logic that underlies their distinct properties. Applying this approach in the AppNL-G-F AD mouse model reveals an early signaling-driven phase of synaptic remodeling followed by a later translation-linked phase, with persistent downregulation of glutamatergic components. These results provide a molecular atlas of CA1 PN inputs and identify stage-specific mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability in early AD.

">A dividing cell model for stable propagation and curing of bona fide human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease prions</a></h4>

              
                Prions are assemblies of misfolded proteins that cause transmissible, progressive neurodegenerative disease in humans and other mammals. Human prion diseases have particular public health and biological significance, both due to their transmissibility between hosts, and the mechanisms they share with many other neurodegenerative conditions. However, their study has been considerably impeded by the absence of a cell-based system capable of reproducibly propagating and quantifying bona fide human prion infectivity, which has been a goal for several decades. Here, we describe the first robust, cell-based assay of human prion infectivity in dividing cells. We found that CAD5 cells expressing human prion protein instead of the endogenous mouse prion protein, replicate human prion infectivity from brain samples of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) expressing valine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. Moreover, these cells quantify human prion infectivity with similar sensitivity to the current gold standard animal bioassay, at a fraction of the cost and time, maintain persistent infection that can be cured with an anti-prion treatment, and can be adapted for therapeutic screening. This novel system permits direct cell-based quantification and investigation of human prion infectivity for the first time.

">Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamatergic Neurons Suppress Hippocampal Sharp-wave Ripples and Induce Head Movements in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Sharp-wave ripples are brief, high-frequency hippocampal oscillations crucial for memory consolidation, occurring predominantly during the non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. While ripples are generated intrinsically within the hippocampus, growing evidence suggests that their occurrence is modulated by subcortical regions. Whether the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a subcortical region that directly projects to the hippocampus, regulates ripple activity remains unknown. To investigate this, we optogenetically activated VTA neurons during NREM sleep and recorded ripple activity in the dorsal hippocampus via field recording electrodes. Using cell-type specific excitatory opsin expression in the VTA, we found that activation of glutamatergic (vGlut2+) neurons strongly suppressed ripple incidence. In contrast, activation of GABAergic (vGAT+) neurons produced weak suppression, and activation of dopaminergic (DAT+) neurons showed no effect. During ripple suppression by glutamatergic activation, we observed small but consistent head movements. Trial-by-trial analysis revealed no correlation between head movement and ripple suppression. Furthermore, glutamatergic activation during wakefulness also led to head movement, suggesting that ripple suppression and head movement could be dissociated. Overall, our results suggest that VTA vGlut2+ neurons play a role in head movement and that their activation suppresses hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during NREM sleep, offering a potential way to alter memory consolidation.

">Affiliative behavioural phenotype and microglial activation predict social decision-making following immune activation</a></h4>

              
                Social animals are faced with a critical decision when sick: to affiliate or withdraw. The behavioural response during an immune challenge varies by individual and species. However, the social and biological factors leading to variation in this decision during an immune challenge are unknown. Here, we explore the affiliative behavioural phenotype, "huddlers" and "non-huddlers," as a social predictor, and microglial activation and peripheral cytokine expression as biological predictors of social-decision making during an immune challenge. To measure social-decision making, we recorded social approach and time spent in proximity to a familiar same-sex conspecific versus a novel object in the social California mouse following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Behavioural phenotype predicted both the social response to LPS and the relationship between cytokine activity and social behaviour, suggesting that social experience regulates social decision-making during sick versus healthy conditions. Additionally, we found that elevated microglia activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) negatively correlated with social behaviour, positioning these regions for future exploration for the role of microglia on social decision-making. Our results identify the predictive power of behavioural phenotypes on social response to sickness and a link between microglia and decision-making during sickness.

">A Mesoscale Framework for Psychedelic Drug Action in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism of psychedelic drug action is a dynamic area of neuroscience, with two major lines of investigation: (1) laboratory studies at the molecular and cellular level, and (2) human neuroimaging studies of functional brain networks. Despite considerable progress, there remains insufficient understanding of the link between molecular/cellular substrates of psychedelics and the whole-brain network effects that result. Here we report a study of psychedelic action that focuses on the intermediate spatial scale of local brain regions (<1cm3). We analyzed the effects of classical psychedelics (dimethyltryptamine [DMT], lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin) and non-classical psychedelics (nitrous oxide, ketamine) in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that all five drugs reduced regional homogeneity, that is, they disrupted local synchrony, in small-scale brain regions; this disruption occurred extensively in cortical regions and sparsely in subcortical regions. Dynamic analysis of both regional homogeneity and global functional connectivity showed an inverse pattern, with large-scale functional connectivity being enhanced as local synchrony declined. We then conducted dominance analysis to assess the contribution of various neurotransmitter receptors to changes in regional homogeneity. DMT, LSD, and psilocybin showed the 5-HT receptors as the most dominant association; by contrast, regional homogeneity changes attributable to both nitrous oxide and ketamine were most strongly associated with the NMDA receptor. Both neuronal (including interneurons) and non-neuronal cell types were linked to psychedelic-induced changes in synchrony at the level of local brain regions. These data, across five drugs from two drug classes, provide evidence that a diverse set of molecular and cellular events lead to a common outcome of disrupted synchrony in local brain regions, which in turn mediate drug-specific changes in global functional connectivity.

">Pupil size reveals the perceptual quality and effortless nature of synesthesia</a></h4>

              
                Synesthesia describes cross-modal processes that can generate 'extra' conscious percepts, such as seeing additional color when reading numbers. While existing research focuses on the mechanisms and effects of synesthetic associations, it often overlooks its most distinctive feature: unique sensory phenomenology. Here, we introduce pupillometry as an objective physiological measure of synesthetic color phenomenology. Across 16 grapheme-color synesthetes and two matched control groups, pupil responses tracked the brightness of synesthetic colors under constant physical visual input, scaling with self-reported strength. Synesthetic colors elicited pupil dynamics comparable to real colors, dissociating synesthetes from non-synesthetes. These responses emerged too rapidly to reflect imagery and scaled with reported color brightness, revealing cross-modally caused genuine perceptual processing. Controls required to generate color associations showed greater effort-linked pupil dilation than synesthetes or controls who did not report colors, providing evidence for the effortless nature of synesthesia. Synesthesia thus provides an extraordinarily tractable human model for studying physiologically measurable phenomenology.

">Linking White-Matter Development to Clinical Variation in Autism: Longitudinal Normative Modelling of FA in the EU-AIMS LEAP Cohort</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism is characterised by marked neurobiological and clinical heterogeneity, which often limits the sensitivity of traditional group comparisons. Longitudinal normative modelling offers a way to capture heterogeneity and to describe an individual's brain-behaviour relationships beyond diagnostic labels. Methods: We analysed diffusion MRI scans from 3 waves of the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). Using normative models of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) we computed individual deviations relative to age typical norms. Our sample included 544 different individuals across all waves (Wave 1: 344 [autistic 189]; Wave 2: 297 [autistic 162]; Wave 3: 226 [autistic 145]), aged 7-37 years, with mean intervals of ~1.5 years (W1-W2) and ~6 years (W1-W3). We first tested for group level differences between autism and no-autism and then examined the associations with sensory, adaptive, cognitive, and behavioural measures across development within the autism group. Results: Although mean FA differences between autistic and non-autistic participants were not significant, correlations between individual differences in FA and behaviour across repeated measurements yielded moderate but reproducible results. The cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, callosal fibres (genu and splenium), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus were among the most frequently identified pathways associated with clinical traits. For these circuits, FA values were higher in individuals with better adaptive functioning (VABS) and lower in those reporting sensory processing (SSP) difficulties. Findings were mixed for associations between FA and symptom severity (ADOS). The largest cross-sectional signal appeared at Wave 2, and although some of the same circuitry re-appeared over about 7.5 years from Wave 1 to Wave 3, effect sizes remained modest and variable, consistent with heterogeneity and power differences across waves, but still pointing to a stable white matter tract pattern. Conclusions: Autism's white-matter organisation reflects a dimensional and individually patterned architecture rather than a categorical distinction. Stable, person-specific deviations from shared neurodevelopmental pathways are linked to behavioural variation among autistic individuals. Longitudinal normative modelling therefore provides a practical approach to understand and quantify this heterogeneity.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. Current neuroimaging-based diagnostic methods often rely on functional connectivity features extracted from a single perspective, either low-order interactions or high-order co-fluctuations, limiting their capacity to capture the hierarchical and dynamic properties of brain networks. We propose ViT-CMN, a novel ASD diagnosis framework that integrates multilevel dynamic connectivity information from both low-order and high-order perspectives. First, dynamic functional connectivity networks are constructed using a sliding window approach to capture temporal variations. To enrich data diversity, a temporal reorganization-based augmentation strategy is introduced, which generates additional dynamic sequences by shifting their starting time points. For each sequence, seventh-order central moment features are extracted to enhance statistical stability over time. These multiview features are then structurally reorganized via a jigsaw-style fusion strategy into a unified 2D representation. This fused input is modeled using a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract discriminative representations across spatial and hierarchical dimensions through self-attention mechanisms. Experiments on the autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) dataset demonstrate that ViT-CMN outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving a top classification accuracy of 79.8%. The model also successfully identifies ASD-related brain regions that align with known neuropathological findings. ViT-CMN effectively addresses the limitation of single-view modeling in previous studies by structurally fusing heterogeneous dynamic features into a ViT-compatible form. The proposed approach provides a powerful and interpretable solution for ASD diagnosis, with strong potential for broader applications in neuroimaging-based disorder classification.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Selective attention requires fast and accurate distractor suppression. We investigated if broadband high-frequency activity (BHA; 80–150 Hz), indicative of local neuronal population dynamics in early sensory cortices, indexes rapid processing of distracting information. In a first experiment we tested whether BHA distinguishes targets from distracting information in a visual search paradigm using tilted gratings as targets and distractors. In a second experiment, we examined whether BHA distractor processing can be trained by statistical regularities. In both experiments, BHA preceded the target enhancement (N<sub>T</sub>) and distractor suppression (P<sub>D</sub>; 1–40 Hz) event-related field (ERF) components and distinguished between targets and distractors. Only the BHA but not ERF component amplitude correlated with participants’ performance and was higher for lateral distractors versus lateral targets. Furthermore, BHA predicted the strength of the P<sub>D</sub>. These results indicate that BHA initiates stimulus discrimination via distractor suppression.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ventral visual stream has undergone extensive reorganization within the primate lineage. While some work has examined restructuring of the ventral prefrontal cortical gray matter across primates, comparative studies of white matter connectivity are lacking primarily due to difficulties in data acquisition and processing. Here, we present a data-driven approach to the study of white matter connectivity using postmortem diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. With this approach, we reconstruct anterior temporal-frontal and occipitotemporal-frontal connections across 2 anthropoids and 1 strepsirrhine: the rhesus macaque, the black-capped squirrel monkey, and the ring-tailed lemur. We find that the anthropoids exhibit more dorsal prefrontal innervation of these ventral visual connections. This study supports the hypothesis that anthropoid primates underwent extensive reorganization of both gray and white matter during their emergence as visual foragers in a complex ecological niche. The data-driven techniques presented here enable further research on white matter connectivity in previously understudied species.</span>
