                arXiv:2601.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following limb amputation and targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), nerves supplying agonist and antagonist muscles are rerouted into separate targeted muscles, disrupting natural neuromechanical coupling between muscle groups. Using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays in reinnervated muscles, we show that neural signals for agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled: motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during corresponding antagonist tasks, despite no visual feedback on coactivation being provided.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378">Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15566">Simultaneity of consciousness with physical reality: the key that unlocks the mind-matter problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2309.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of explaining the relationship between subjective experience and physical reality remains difficult and unresolved. In most explanations, consciousness is epiphenomenal, without causal power. The most notable exception is Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides a causal explanation for consciousness. However, IIT relies on an identity between subjectivity and a particular type of physical structure, namely with an information structure that has intrinsic causal power greater than the sum of its parts. Any theory that relies on a psycho-physical identity must eventually appeal to panpsychism, which undermines that theorys claim to be fundamental. IIT has recently pivoted towards a strong version of causal emergence, but macroscopic causal structures cannot be causally stronger than its microscopic parts without some new physical law or governing principle. The approach taken here is designed to uncover such a principle. The decisive argument is entirely deductive from initial premises that are phenomenologically certain. If correct, the arguments prove that conscious experience is sufficient to create additional degrees of causal freedom independently of the content of experience, and in a manner that is unpredictable and unobservable by any temporally sequential means. This provides a fundamental principle about consciousness, and a conceptual bridge between it and the physics describing what is experienced. The principle makes testable predictions about brain function, with notable differences from IIT, some of which are also empirically testable.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13638">State Space Models Naturally Produce Time Cell and Oscillatory Behaviors and Scale to Abstract Cognitive Functions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal connectivity and biophysics, how these low-level phenomena eventually produce abstract behaviors remains largely unresolved. Here, we propose that a framework based on State Space Models, an emerging class of deep learning architectures, can help bridge this gap. We suggest that the differential equations governing elements in a State Space Model are conceptually consistent with the dynamics of biophysical processes, while the model offers a scalable framework to build on the dynamics to produce emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this framework by training a model employing a diagonal state transition matrix on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that neural behaviors such as time cells naturally emerge from two fundamental principles: optimal pre-configuration and rotational dynamics. These features are shown mathematically to optimize history compression, and naturally generate structured temporal dynamics even prior to training, mirroring recent findings in biological circuits. We show that learning acts primarily as a selection mechanism that fine-tunes these pre-configured oscillatory modes, rather than constructing temporal codes de novo. The model can be readily scaled to abstract cognitive functions such as event counting, supporting the use of State Space Models as a computationally tractable framework for understanding neural activities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12054">Automated Place Preference Paradigm for Optogenetic Stimulation of the Pedunculopontine Nucleus Reveals Motor Arrest-Linked Preference Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.12054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.

                arXiv:2601.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In typical black-box optimization applications, the available computational budget is often allocated to a single algorithm, typically chosen based on user preference with limited knowledge about the problem at hand or according to some expert knowledge. However, we show that splitting the budget across several algorithms yield significantly better results. This approach benefits from both algorithm complementarity across diverse problems and variance reduction within individual functions, and shows that algorithm portfolios do NOT require parallel evaluation capabilities. To demonstrate the advantage of sequential algorithm portfolios, we apply it to the COCO data archive, using over 200 algorithms evaluated on the BBOB test suite. The proposed sequential portfolios consistently outperform single-algorithm baselines, achieving relative performance gains of over 14%, and offering new insights into restart mechanisms and potential for warm-started execution strategies.

                arXiv:2511.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

Abstract: We propose a reliable and energy-efficient framework for 3D brain tumor segmentation using spiking neural networks (SNNs). A multi-view ensemble of sagittal, coronal, and axial SNN models provides voxel-wise uncertainty estimation and enhances segmentation robustness. To address the high computational cost in training SNN models for semantic image segmentation, we employ Forward Propagation Through Time (FPTT), which maintains temporal learning efficiency with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenges (BraTS 2017 and BraTS 2023) demonstrate competitive accuracy, well-calibrated uncertainty, and an 87% reduction in FLOPs, underscoring the potential of SNNs for reliable, low-power medical IoT and Point-of-Care systems.

                arXiv:2601.16793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel transfer learning approach and data augmentation technique for mental stability classification using human voice signals and addresses the challenges associated with limited data availability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyse spectrogram images generated from voice recordings. Three CNN architectures, VGG16, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, were evaluated across three experimental phases: training on non-augmented data, augmented data, and transfer learning. This proposed transfer learning approach involves pre-training models on the augmented dataset and fine-tuning them on the non-augmented dataset while ensuring strict data separation to prevent data leakage. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification performance compared to the baseline approach. Among three CNN architectures, DenseNet121 achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 99% using the proposed transfer learning approach. This finding highlights the effectiveness of combining data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance CNN-based classification of mental stability using voice spectrograms, offering a promising non-invasive tool for mental health diagnostics.

                arXiv:2507.20746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12723">An Evolutionary Framework for Automatic Optimization Benchmark Generation via Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.12723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21771">Gradient-Based Neuroplastic Adaptation for Concurrent Optimization of Neuro-Fuzzy Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.21771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a vision-based video game called DOOM.

">Mechanism-Specific Speech Encoding Failures in Auditory Neuropathy: A Computational Phenotyping Framework</a></h4>

              
                Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) causes severe speech comprehension deficits despite preserved cochlear function. Patients vary widely in their impairments, likely reflecting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms that current diagnostics cannot distinguish. A fundamental barrier to diagnosis is that standard speech tests take a one-size-fits-all approach - yielding aggregate intelligibility scores that average across phoneme categories, obscuring mechanism-specific patterns. We hypothesized that different ANSD mechanisms produce distinct phoneme-specific signatures that targeted testing could reveal. Using computational modeling of auditory nerve responses, we tested four mechanism types through three sequential experiments demonstrating that mechanism-specific encoding disruptions cascade into speech recognition failures that remain robust under noise. Brief consonants (flaps, stops) showed severe disruption while sustained vowels were relatively preserved - and critically, these category-specific patterns differed across mechanisms. Speech recognition models trained on ANSD-degraded neural representations developed compensation strategies that generalize to healthy signals, while the reverse failed completely, establishing a fundamental asymmetry: spectral compensation generalizes while temporal integration requires intact timing. These patterns persist under noise, where the same training that benefits healthy listeners harms ANSD listeners, explaining why ANSD patients struggle disproportionately in real-world listening conditions. The results suggest that phoneme-targeted testing - examining specific categories rather than using phonetically balanced materials - may enable mechanism-specific diagnosis and personalized intervention.

">Higher-Order Thalamus is Pivotal in Schizophrenia-Associated Pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction has been proposed as cellular pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia, yet the brain-wide distribution of dysfunctional circuits at single-neuron resolution has remained unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive multi-probe electrophysiological investigations in vivo in the Grin2a+/- preclinical model for schizophrenia and control animals, recording across ~45 brain regions spanning cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Mutants displayed distributed and graded alterations across regions, with prominent activity reductions in higher-order thalamus and cross-parameter alterations across prefrontal cortices, striatum, and hippocampus. Restoration of higher-order thalamic activity in mutants was sufficient to normalize alterations in connected prefrontal cortices and striatum and unexpectedly cascaded distally to hippocampus and sensory cortices. Thus, higher-order thalamus plays a pivotal role in schizophrenia pathophysiology and restoration of a single informed locus could present a potent therapeutic strategy.

">Adolescent Social Isolation Facilitates Tau Spread in Raphe Nuclei Linking Depression and Hyperalgesia in Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Tau pathology in brainstem serotonergic circuits drives early neuropsychiatric dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet mechanisms linking the exposome, particularly social stress exposures to depression and altered pain perception, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adolescent social isolation, a critical psychosocial exposome factor and major trigger of depression, facilitates tau propagation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and downstream raphe nuclei, producing both neuropsychiatric and pain-related sequelae. Tau[P301L] was transduced into the DRN of 30-day socially isolated or group housed C57BL/6J mice using AAV, with control mice receiving AAV-GFP. Four weeks post-transduction, anxiety, social behavior, and pain sensitivity were assessed, and phosphorylated tau (ptau) within the DRN and spread to the median raphe (MRN) and raphe magnus (RMg) serotonergic neurons were evaluated. Socially isolated tau[P301L] mice exhibited hyperlocomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social deficits and hyperalgesia. Histological analysis revealed elevated ptau within TPH2 neurons in the DRN and trans-synaptic tau spread to MRN and RMg, accompanied by reduced TPH2 and increased ptau at the downstream raphe nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed altered expression of Slc6a4 and Tgm2, a stress-responsive gene implicated in AD. These results indicate that DRN tau under social stress drives neuropsychiatric phenotypes, while tau spread to MRN and RMg disrupts serotonergic modulation of pain. This study provides the first evidence that adolescent stress promotes tau propagation within the raphe nuclei, linking early neuropsychiatric and pain-processing deficits to prodromal Alzheimers disease and identifying a critical pathway through which psychosocial exposome risk converges with tau pathology to enable early intervention.

">Reconfiguration of Premotor Excitation and Inhibition Drives Behavior-Specific Protopodium Dynamics in Drosophila Larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animals use the same muscles to generate distinct locomotor behaviors, raising the question of how shared motor systems produce behavior-specific outputs. In Drosophila larvae, forward and backward crawling recruit largely overlapping motor pools but differ in the timing of ventral oblique (VO) muscle activation, which occurs late in forward crawling and early in backward crawling. Although this timing difference has been described, the circuit mechanisms that impose it and its functional significance have remained unclear. Here, we show that VO muscles are primary drivers of protopodium movement, a limb-like structure involved in substrate engagement during crawling, and that their behavior-specific activation timing is controlled by a tri-segmental premotor circuit. Using muscle calcium imaging, optogenetic and connectome-based circuit analysis, and biomechanical modeling, we identify a feedforward inhibitory motif composed of two previously characterized excitatory premotor neurons (A27h and A18b3) and the inhibitory premotor neuron A06c. During forward crawling, A06c exhibits a biphasic activity pattern that defines a narrow temporal window for VO contraction and prevents premature, multi-segmental VO activation. During backward crawling, this premotor configuration is disengaged: A27h and A18b3 are inactive, and the initial inhibitory peak of A06c is absent, permitting earlier VO activation. Disrupting this circuit causes premature VO activation, impaired protopodium folding, compressed intersegmental coordination, and reduced forward crawling efficiency. Together, our findings show how reconfiguration of premotor excitation and inhibition generates behavior-specific muscle dynamics within a shared motor system.

">How the olfactory bulb maintains stable odor manifolds amid adaptation and representational drift</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive coding in sensory circuits enables stable perception while accommodating experience-dependent changes. In the olfactory bulb (OB), repeated odor exposure reshapes population activity even without explicit behavioral feedback, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. By analyzing longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging datasets from the mouse OB, we identified three concurrent forms of representational change: gain adaptation, similarity-dependent pattern separation or convergence, and a rotation of encoding subspace resulting in the representational drift. Using a computational model of the mitral cell-granule cell circuit, we showed that Hebbian plasticity and structural connectivity constraints are sufficient to reproduce these transformations. Despite global representational drift, the relative geometry of odor response vectors remained stable, preserving a low-dimensional odor manifold. Together, our results reveal how local plasticity and network structure jointly enable both stability and flexibility in early sensory coding.

">Metabolic reallocation in spinal cord oligodendrocytes drives chronic pain via neuronal β-amyloid production</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral injury reprograms metabolism in spinal cord oligodendrocytes, initiating a molecular cascade that drives chronic pain via neuronal {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) release. After injury, mouse spinal oligodendrocytes downregulate myelin protein synthesis and upregulate lipid biosynthesis- but reroute lipids toward neuroplastic remodeling and away from myelin maintenance. This metabolic reallocation disrupts myelin integrity and axonal function, causing neuronal accumulation of amyloid precursor protein, enhanced expression of its processing {beta}-secretase BACE1, and local release of A{beta} peptides. Blocking A{beta} production or clearing A{beta} deposits stops the transition to pain chronicity. Deleting the lysosomal lipid hydrolase NAAA in oligodendrocytes prevents both injury-induced A{beta} production and chronic pain development. The findings identify an unexpected mechanistic link between chronic pain and Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration, positioning A{beta} as a target for therapeutic intervention.

">Distinct roles of directional and positional experience in de novo visuomotor learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans can flexibly acquire entirely new sensorimotor mappings, a process known as de novo motor learning. A central challenge in de novo motor learning is that the learner must discover a viable solution from scratch within a highly redundant control space, without predefined task constraints. Understanding what types of sensorimotor information contribute to the formation of accurate motor behavior in such situations is therefore critical for explaining how novel sensorimotor skills are acquired. While previous studies have suggested that novel visuomotor mappings can be formed based on movement direction and target position, it remains unclear how these two types of information contribute to the learning process. To address this question, we trained 25 human participants to learn arbitrary joystick-to-cursor mapping. We then employed a generalization paradigm to selectively restrict learning experience to either movement direction or target position. Three distinct target conditions were designed: one emphasized target position (P), another emphasized movement direction (D), and a third (P&D) encouraged learning of both components separately. As a result, direction experience improved movement initiation, whereas position experience enhanced movement termination. However, in the P&D condition, combining these experiences did not yield additive generalization. Instead, endpoint accuracy was positively correlated with the degree of alignment between direction- and position-based joystick outputs within the control space. These results suggest that accurate formation of a novel sensorimotor map depends on the coordinated use of directional and positional experiences.

">Dissociable neuronal substrates for positive and negative valence stimuli in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus accumbens (NAc) responds to both natural and artificial rewards and to aversive stimuli; however, it remains unclear whether these opposing valence signals engage distinct neuronal ensembles. Here we used Fos-CreERT2-based activity-dependent tagging to label NAc neuronal ensembles activated by cocaine or foot shock. We found that cocaine ensemble consisted predominantly of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), whereas foot shock ensemble similarly recruited D1- and D2-MSNs. One-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice revealed that acute cocaine primarily excited D1-MSNs while inhibiting the majority of D2-MSNs, whereas foot shock induced excitatory responses in both types of MSNs. Optogenetic reactivation of the cocaine-ensemble elicited a strong behavioural preference, whereas reactivation of the shock-ensemble produced no significant behavioural effect. Together, these findings demonstrate that cocaine recruits a functionally specific NAc ensemble distinct from that recruited by shock, providing mechanistic insight into the valence-specific neuronal substrates underlying reward and aversion processing.

">Tractometry-Based Quantification of Along-Tract White-Matter Hemispheric Asymmetry in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                White-matter hemispheric asymmetry is a fundamental property of human brain organization and is known to change in aging, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative disorders. Tractometry analyzes diffusion-derived microstructural measures along the full length of tracts, localizing changes to specific tract-segments rather than collapsing tracts into a single value. Yet, existing frameworks lack a principled way to quantify left-right hemispheric asymmetries along homologous tracts. Here, we introduce an asymmetry-aware tractometry framework that integrates a symmetric white-matter atlas with BUAN (Bundle Analytics) to enable anatomically consistent, along-tract comparison of homologous pathways. By defining homologous bundles with a shared template and consistent orientation, each left-hemisphere segment is directly matched to its right-hemisphere counterpart, enabling principled, segment-wise comparison and revealing spatially localized asymmetries along-tract. Applying this framework to diffusion MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprising 1,215 subjects, we demonstrate how this approach reveals systematic left-right asymmetries across major white-matter pathways and show how these patterns differentiate cognitively normal (CN) individuals from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This method provides a sensitive and anatomically grounded tool for studying hemispheric specialization and its disruption in aging and disease, and establishes a general approach for asymmetry-aware tractometry in population neuroimaging studies.

">Integration of ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors in the ventral hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety is a complex emotional state that unfolds as structured sequences of risk assessment and exploratory behaviors enabling animals to evaluate potential threats in the environment. The ventral hippocampus (vH) regulates anxiety responses, yet the neuronal substrates orchestrating specific ethologically defined anxiety-related behaviors remain unclear. Here, we combined high-resolution 3D behavioral tracking with cell-type specific in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulations to dissect vH microcircuit dynamics during anxiety. We identified protected and unprotected stretch-attend postures (pSAP and uSAP), along with head dipping, as core anxiety-related risk-assessment behaviors organized along a spatial gradient in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Ventral hippocampal (vH) pyramidal neurons were broadly engaged across all risk-assessment behaviors, consistent with a generalized role in encoding anxiety-related information. In contrast, interneuronal subclasses exhibited striking functional specialization: parvalbumin (PV) interneurons were selectively recruited during uSAP and head dipping, behaviors associated with direct threat exposure, whereas somatostatin (Sst) interneurons were preferentially activated during pSAP, which reflect approach-avoidance conflicts and decision-making processes. Collectively, these findings establish a microcircuit-level framework in which distinct vH neuronal subclasses differentially gate risk-assessment strategies, enabling flexible transitions between avoidance and exploratory behaviors during anxiety.

">The compositional nature of the human alpha rhythm</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state brain activity is dominated by oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The dominant frequency within this band, the individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), has been widely used as a global marker of inter-individual variability in perceptual and cognitive functions, as well as clinical phenotypes. However, the traditional approach implicitly assumes a single oscillatory rhythm varying along a parametric continuum. Here, we analyzed resting-state EEG data from more than 2000 participants across multiple independent datasets. We identify three distinct and highly stable alpha components, or archetypes, that jointly and compositionally determine the IAPF. These components exhibit dissociable age-related trajectories as well as distinct scalp topographies and cortical sources. Together, these findings indicate that individual differences in alpha activity do not reflect variation along a single frequency dimension, but rather differences in the relative contribution of discrete alpha generators. This calls for a reevaluation of many reported associations between alpha frequency, brain function, and clinical phenotypes.

">Spatially resolved transcriptome-metabolome integration reveals region-specific glial lipid dysregulation associated with Alzheimer's pathology</a></h4>

              
                Glial cells maintain the brain's lipid and energy balance, and their breakdown is increasingly recognized as a causal contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). While this concept is established, no approach has directly shown how glial homeostatic failure manifests across brain regions and microenvironments or how it links local pathology, such as plaques, to global metabolic imbalance. To address this gap, we developed iMIST, an integrated platform that combines MALDI-based metabolite imaging, histology, and spatial transcriptomics within a single tissue section to align molecular and anatomical information. Using a mouse model of late-onset AD that recapitulates both amyloid deposition and metabolic vulnerability, iMIST revealed that glial lipid dysregulation is widespread but spatially specialized. In gray matter, plaque-associated microglia were associated with upregulated glycerophospholipid-remodeling in cortico-thalamic areas indicating metabolic stress around local pathology. In contrast, white matter tracts rich in lipid-producing oligodendrocytes show plaque-independent deficits in galactosylceramide metabolism reflecting their high myelin demand. Both processes intensify with age, transforming adaptive glial responses into persistent metabolic dysfunction. Together, these findings demonstrate the spatial interplay between global glial metabolic imbalance and local microenvironmental stressors associated with AD pathology. By integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic information in situ, iMIST provides a framework for uncovering how regional glial vulnerability shapes the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

                The developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination is a novel approach, based on quenching of fluorescein fluorescence under interaction with the analyzed compound. In order to stabilize the emitted signal, low-pressure mercury lamp (LPML) as an excitation source and eight solar cells arranged at a 90° interval were used. As a result, the correlated signal is more sensitive and stable. The linear nature of the method in the 0.08-12 mmol/L range reflects a correlation coefficient of 0.9905 & R2 %= 98.10 which is a perfect linearity. The limit of detection was calculated as 0.61 μg/170μL while the limit of quantification as 1.83 μg/sample ensuring excellent trace detection of etoricoxib. The precision on RSD (relative percent standard deviation) scale was determined to be less than 0.5 % which reflects a high level of repeatability and reproducibility of the method. The proposed method was applied to commercial pharmaceutical formulation. In the following statistical experiment, both paired two-sided t-tests were employed. The strength of the proposed method in relation to the official references was an object for one test whereas the speed of the routine one as well as its decrease in reagents usage proportions was an object for another test. There was no significant difference in those tests which proves the applicability of the proposed method. Moreover, the precision of the novel method utilized less reagents, and a significant variation, forming a confidence level utilization was observed. In conclusion, the developed ISNAG-spectrofluorometric method of Etoricoxib determination proved to be a rapid, stable, accurate, and validated method suitable for routine investigation of commercial pharmaceutical formulations.

                Hyperspectral band selection has become a key focus in hyperspectral image processing as it reduces the spectral redundancy and computational overhead, thereby improving classification performance. However, optimal band selection remains challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Although numerous metaheuristic algorithms have been introduced in recent years to address this problem, achieving an effective balance between exploration and exploitation continues to pose a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines a parameter-free binary Jaya algorithm with a mutation operator to enhance exploration and maintain solution diversity within the search space. We employ Opposition-based Learning (OBL) for population initialization and Quasi-Reflection reinitialization strategy to add diversity whenever fitness stagnation occurs. To simultaneously improve classification performance and band reduction we adopt weighted sum multi-objective fitness function that minimizes redundancy and enhances model generalization. Our proposed method is evaluated using three benchmark datasets, namely Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed method outperforms recent metaheuristic-based band selection techniques. Its superior performance makes it well suited for various HSI applications.

                This study analyzed international research on systems thinking in science education from 2014 to 2025. Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individual’s genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method. The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelor’s degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                Background Since the building sector contributes significantly to carbon emissions, using sustainable materials is more crucial than ever. Mycelium is investigated in this study as a natural substitute for conventional insulation materials like rock wool and XPS. Its thermal performance has been evaluated in a residential building in New Cairo, Egypt, using Design-Builder simulations, paying particular attention to U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that mycelium is environmentally safe, biodegradable, and provides insulation that is comparable to XPS. This demonstrates its promise as a sustainable option for building in the future. Methods This research uses Design-Builder software version 7.3.0.046 integrated with Energy-Plus to simulate the thermal conductivity of mycelium compared to two of the most frequently utilized traditional materials for insulation in Egypt, in Janna Compound, New Cairo. The analysis examines energy consumption, thermal comfort, Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PPD%). The study provides a comparative evaluation of mycelium insulation compared to traditional materials like XPS and Rockwool. Results According to the simulation results, mycelium insulation performs comparably to XPS regarding U-values, discomfort hours, PPD-PMV, and energy consumption. Specifically, mycelium achieved a 0.323 U-value, reduced discomfort hours percentage to 16.9%, and achieved a ratio of energy reduction of 15.8% compared to the base case. These results demonstrate how mycelium has the potential to compete with traditional insulation materials while offering significant sustainability advantages, such as biodegradability and a lower carbon footprint. Conclusion In Janna Compound, New Cairo, the research shows how mycelium insulation can improve thermal comfort and save energy usage. It performs similarly to XPS but has more positive environmental effects. These results support the integration of mycelium into Egypt’s sustainable housing practices, providing key insights for architects, developers, and policymakers focused on energy-efficient and sustainable urban development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Though it is widely known that tau deposition affects brain structure, the precise localization of these effects is poorly understood, especially in relation to gyral and sulcal anatomy. We investigated whether tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) preferentially affects sulci, and particularly sulcal depths.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 675 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data to investigate relationships between neocortical tau PET signal and cortical thickness. We then examined an advanced AD case with postmortem MRI and coregistered whole-brain phospho-tau staining for evidence of sulcal tau distribution in AD. Finally, in a sample of 187 cognitively unimpaired young and older adults with resting-state functional MRI, we examined connectivity strength between tau-vulnerable regions and the hippocampus across adulthood, prior to disease-related cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our findings revealed that tau-related cortical thinning predominantly occurs in sulcal regions, especially the deepest parts. Postmortem histology confirmed preferential tau accumulation in sulcal depths. Additionally, connectivity analyses revealed that, across adulthood, these primarily sulcal regions most susceptible to tau-related thinning also have stronger connectivity to the hippocampus, suggesting a role for network connectivity in the vulnerability of sulci to the effects of tau pathology later in life.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings support the hypothesis that sulci, and particularly their depths, represent structurally and functionally vulnerable regions for tau deposition in AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this sulcal vulnerability provides insight into general principles driving regional susceptibility to pathology, and sheds light on the detrimental functional and cognitive effects of tau pathology.

                Background The burden of visual impairment and avoidable blindness has been attributed to the shortage and poor distribution of adequately trained eye care personnel. In the district health system, primary health care (PHC) nurses are the first point of contact for eye care patients. To provide adequate eye care, the nurses in PHC clinics apply their knowledge on basic eye health to ensure best practices and management for patients that present at their clinics. Anecdotal evidence regarding the knowledge and practices of these PHC professionals is scarce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PHC nurses’ knowledge and practices on eye health. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural district of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Stratified random sampling was used to select 28 from the 74 PHC clinics in the district. A researcher-administered questionnaire using a 5-point likert scale with options strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree, was developed, piloted and finalised for this study. The tool had four sections: demographic information, knowledge of eye health, practices on evaluating visual function and identification and management of presenting eye conditions. Data were collected, captured onto MSXcel, cleaned, coded and analysed descriptively, and for Chi-squared significance at 95%, using R statistical software. Results From 200 responses, 86.4% (n=172) were females of the African race. Most (93.5%, n=187) had never undergone formal training in eye care. Only 28% (n=56) correctly identified a mature cataract while 28% (n=56) correctly identified signs of glaucoma; the global leading causes of preventable blindness. A total of 94% (n=188) failed to accurately measure visual acuity on a patient. Conclusions PHC nurses showed poor knowledge and practices of common eye conditions. There is an urgent need for eye health training for PHC nurses, and the clear management protocols on eye care.

                Background Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the microvascular complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) which tended not to be detected early, necessitating more effective biomarkers for its detection. HbA1c showed a negative correlation with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and was significantly associated with an increased urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), thereby influencing the progression of DKD. Objective This study was an untargeted metabolomics study and aimed to compare the urinary metabolites of low DKD risk T2DM patients with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c in patients taking metformin-glimepiride. Materials and Methods This study conducted as a cross-sectional study using non-probability sampling at Pasar Minggu District Health Center, 32 samples were divided into controlled (n=16) and uncontrolled HbA1c groups (n=16). Blood samples were collected for HbA1c and eGFR measurements, while urine samples were analyzed for UACR and metabolites. Analysis was performed using LC/MS-QTOF and the data was processed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and various databases. The discrimination results of the two groups were visualized through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The significance of metabolites between groups was selected with the parameters VIP>1, log2(FC)>1.2, and p-value<0.05. Results Fifteen selected metabolites underwent metabolic pathway analysis and were evaluated for their potential as biomarkers. Three of these metabolites showed potential as biomarkers (AUC>0.65): oxaloacetate and 5′-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamidine, which decreased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group, and (S)-dihydroorotate, which increased in the uncontrolled HbA1c group. The involved metabolic pathways included (1) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, (2) citric acid (Krebs cycle), (3) gluconeogenesis, (4) pyruvate, (5) pyrimidine, and (6) purine. Conclusion Based on these results, there’s a significant difference in urine metabolites of the two groups that potentially be the biomarkers for DKD progression with controlled and uncontrolled HbA1c.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-796/v3?src=rss">Bioactive Effects of Plectranthus amboinicus Extract Using Microwave Techniques and Its Value Addition in Cosmeceutical Products [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Plectranthus amboinicus is an aromatic herb known for its medicinal properties and is increasingly explored for cosmetic applications. Its bioactive compounds possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a promising candidate for multifunctional skincare formulations. Methods This study investigated the extraction of bioactive compounds from P. amboinicus leaves using microwave-assisted ethanol extraction. Two drying techniques—tray drying and freeze-drying—were compared to evaluate their impact on the extraction efficiency. The optimal extract (PF15), prepared using 15-minute microwave extraction and freeze-drying, was selected for further analysis. Bioactive content was assessed through quantification of caffeic acid, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity via the DPPH assay. The antimicrobial activity of PF15 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Cutibacterium acnes. Anti-inflammatory potential of PF15 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated human THP-1 macrophages by measuring cytokine production. Results The PF15 extract yielded the highest levels of bioactive compounds and demonstrated strong antioxidant activity. It exhibited significant antimicrobial effects against all tested skin pathogens. In the anti-inflammatory assay, PF15 significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) while upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The extract was formulated into a topical cream, which underwent accelerated stability testing over six heat-cool cycles. The cream remained stable with no signs of phase separation, discoloration, odor change, or microbial contamination, and maintained a pH of 5.5. Conclusions The PF15 extract of P. amboinicus demonstrates potent antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its successful incorporation into a stable cream formulation supports its potential as a multifunctional active ingredient in skincare products. These findings highlight P. amboinicus as a valuable natural source for the development of cosmetic formulations targeting oxidative stress, microbial infection, and inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1303/v3?src=rss">The first whole-genome sequence of a prospective novel sponge-associated Streptomyces strain from Indonesia with a long 1.5 Mbp terminal inverted repeat [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-116/v1?src=rss">Digital Footprint and Its Impact on Improving Customer Experience: An Exploratory Study of a Sample of Internet Companies in Nineveh Governorate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The current study attempts to fill a significant and crucial deficiency in knowing how to trigger the digital footprints for enhancing service quality from the customers’ point of view among Internet service providers as well, especially under the Iraqi environment, Mosul city, Nineveh Governorate. The sector is in a unique competitive situation, and although this strategic function of digital data is extremely critical for personalization initiatives as well as for competitive advantage, very little practical use has been made in such an environment. Indeed, metrics such as (data governance maturity and customer trust) emerged as challenges impacting the use of data analytics and their integration into the improvement of customer experience. As such, this study seeks to understand how local Internet service providers (ISPs) can be empowered by individual customers’ digital footprints, evaluate what influences their most effective use in order to enhance customer experience, and discover best explorations for guidance on appropriate and ethical strategies. Methodology The method data were collected from (ISPs) using a structured questionnaire, issued to a representative sample of ISP and overall number of (319). Results However, the results obtained using statistical analysis indicate that while digital footprints significantly enhance service personalization and support efficiency, there is a substantial implementation gap between data collection and its application to design value-adding interactions. This, in turn, suggests a need to strengthen the analysis capacity of service providers. Conclusion This paper ends with an insight; for Internet service providers to facilitate customer digital footprints and the digital data left by customers to enhance the quality of services, they must adopt a balanced, evidence-based strategy as well as transparent consideration of privacy concerns that sustain user trust.

                Background Recently, health professional education uses visual art observation to promote various observation-related technical skills. This article maps the studies on such interventions, scrutinizes what they measured as observational skills, and discusses their effectiveness. Methods Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews, a scoping review was conducted. Publications from 2001 on were identified by searching four databases and by hand searching. The author screened each publication using the pre-designed eligibility criteria: participants were novice healthcare learners enrolled in visual art observation training; the study aimed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on technical skills related to observation; the skills were objectively measured. The author extracted relevant information from the included papers without additional inquiry into the study authors. The extracted information was illustrated in both a tabular and descriptive format. Results 3,157 publications were identified, of which 18 articles were included. Few studies had valid and reliable experiments. The relatively valid evidence is that the participants listed more elements or signs for artistic or medical images. Conclusions Sound evidence is lacking for all the technical skills intended to be fostered. Observation skills for artistic images have not been demonstrated to transfer to technical skills. Nor do the studies show that they promoted accurate diagnoses and reduced misdiagnoses. Additionally, the evidence on verbalizing skills is not isolated from the impact of discussions and is unclear regarding its transfer to actual communication. For the others, there are not enough valid studies on technical skills. This is true for studies that directly examine promoting accurate diagnosis or reducing misdiagnosis. Moreover, there may be promising alternatives to visual art observations for cultivating such technical skills, but no comparative studies were conducted.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. Unlike existing approaches that modify the loss function during training, the proposed framework operates directly at the level of the governing equations, prior to loss construction. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

                Background Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), such as methandienone, are synthetic testosterone derivatives that are widely used for the enhancement of physical performance and the growth of muscles. This study looked at the effect of methandienone on ovarian CYP19A1 gene expression and oxidative status in rabbits. The work also examined whether supplementation with selenium could reduce the adverse effects caused by methandienone. Methods Twenty healthy adult female rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups and maintained under uniform management for 30 days. The groups included a control, a methandienone-treated group (T1), a selenium group (T2), and a combined methandienone plus selenium group (T3). Serum oestrogens concentrations were measured using standard biochemical techniques. CYP19A1 mRNA expression in ovarian tissue and markers were quantified by established molecular and biochemical protocols. Results Rabbits receiving methandienone alone (T1) showed a significant decline (P≤0.05) in CYP19A1 mRNA expression and serum oestrogens when compared with the control and other treatment groups. Selenium supplementation (T2) produced marked increases in both parameters relative to G1 and G3, indicating a robust corrective effect. Oxidative stress analysis revealed elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl content (PCC) in the T1 group, consistent with increased oxidative stress. Intermediate oxidative stress values were observed in the T3 group, exceeding those in the T1 group but remaining below those in the T2 group. Conclusion Methandienone appears to impair ovarian function by suppressing CYP19A1gene expression and promoting oxidative stress, leading to reduced steroidogenic activity. Selenium administration mitigates these disturbances by enhancing antioxidant defense and partially restoring gene expression and oestrogens levels. These findings highlight the potential of selenium as a supportive intervention against methandienone -induced oxidative and hormonal disruptions in rabbits.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 infection is novel and widespread globally, causing a range of illness severity. The impacts on the liver from SARS-CoV-2 are variable and appear unpredictable. Objective In the weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, liver-related blood tests are abnormal in patterns different than in matched controls without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods This was a retrospective study of health administrative data of individuals in Ontario, Canada between January 2020 and September 2022. Cases were individuals with their first positive COVID-19 test with at least one liver-related blood test (AST, ALT, albumin, INR, bilirubin) available in the following 28 days. Two control individuals (with a negative COVID-19 test) were age/sex matched to each case. Any patients with a diagnostic code indicting pre-existing liver disease, or a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding six months were excluded. Machine learning analysis approaches included logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and neutral network models. Results 100,574 cases and 200,709 matched controls were included. 49% (49,299) had at least one abnormal liver test in 28 days following positive COVID-19 test. Of the controls, 41% (82,495) had at least one abnormal liver test in the 28 days following negative COVID-19 test. The optimal machine learning model used XGBoost for adult cases, with an area under the curve of 0.74. Conclusions Further studies could use this approach to create monitoring systems to use abnormalities like liver enzyme changes, at a population level, as a bellwether for not only COVID-19 outbreaks, but also other hepatotropic illness epidemics, and pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-113/v1?src=rss">Experiences of Indonesian Christian Religious Education Teachers in Implementing the Independent Curriculum in Sen-ior High Schools: A Phenomenological Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study explores the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. The independent curriculum in Indonesia was developed as a more adaptive curriculum framework as part of the learning reform initiative, focusing on essential materials and the development of students’ character and skills. The government explains that the main characteristics of this curriculum that support learning recovery are project-based learning, which develops soft skills and character. Methods This study employs a qualitative phenomenological approach to examine how Christian religious education teachers engage with the independent curriculum. Given that the research questions focused on the subjective experiences of Christian religious education teachers, data were collected through semi-structured and in-depth interviews with four selected participants, chosen based on the study’s objectives and a purposive sampling approach in North Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia. Results The study revealed that teachers encountered several challenges, including IT skills gaps, differences in understanding the concept of independent curriculum, and the scarcity of relevant materials for Christian education. Teachers need help adapting to the limitations of old learning methods and the special training and mentoring required to implement the new technology system of the independent curriculum. However, there are initiatives from teachers to collaborate, add materials, and learn from the teacher community to improve their competence. Therefore, this study ultimately offers a new perspective on understanding a phenomenon, namely, the experiences of Christian religious education teachers in implementing the independent curriculum. Conclusion This study emphasizes the importance of more comprehensive support from the government and schools to enhance the effectiveness of implementing the independent curriculum, especially in Christian religious education. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and education practitioners to support the effective and sustainable implementation of the independent curriculum.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-112/v1?src=rss">Experimental study For improving sandy soil against uplift capacity by Emulsion Asphalt for Anchor plate [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The use of anchors fixed in sandy soil is currently pioneering, especially in fixing the sides of excavations or marine structures, and even in engineering structures exposed to lateral loads. Therefore, there is a need to use improvements to develop the bearing capacity of anchors, whether single or group, or even if their burial depth is shallow or deep, as is the case with other engineering structures. Method A physical model was used in this experimental research to study the behavior of anchors individually and collectively in sandy soil and how to change the critical depth of burial from shallow depth to deep depth individually and collectively with anchors in addition to the upward bearing capacity in the soil without improvement and also using electronic measuring devices to measure the vertical displacement, and then using bituminous emulsion and recording the values of the uplift bearing capacity of the anchors and comparing them with natural soil. Results In this paper model tests were carried out by using single and line groups square anchor plates (1x2), (1x3), (1x4) & (1x5) in sandy soil with (30) different embedded ratio (H/D) test to understand the behavior of the anchor plate in sandy soils depending upon on the transition from shallow to deep anchor, also to obtain the transitional depth by which the anchor acts as a shallow or deep while in loading state. Depending on the tests the critical depth in the line group ranges from (5D) to (6D), while using a single anchor the critical depth is approximately more than (5D). The other (10) tests were carried out for improving the soil around the anchor by emulsion asphalt at depth (2D) & (6D) shallow and deep respectively. The optimum ratio of the emulsion asphalt was from (4-6)% by direct shear and unconfined pressure tests. The ultimate capacity was improved at high ratio for shallow single anchor than deep single anchor. The use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period resulted in an increase in the uplift capacity of both the individual anchors and the group. On the other hand, the uplift capacity of the anchor was increased with the use of asphalt emulsion with a 21-day curing period. Furthermore, the uplift capacity of the individual anchor was lower than that of the group of anchors, while the improvement in the shallow anchors resulted in a higher increase in uplift capacity than the deep anchors. Conclusions After conducting laboratory experiments on sandy soil with anchors installed in it and at different depths, it was found that there is a critical depth for the anchors at which the depth moves from shallow to deep. Also, the improvement with bituminous emulsion led to an increase in the load-bearing capacity of the anchors when lifting.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-111/v1?src=rss">Exploring the Relationship Between Decreased Sound Tolerance and Neural Attention Processing: An ERP Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined how attentional control resources influence DST. Previous studies have shown that increasing cognitive load enhances the brain activity component (N100) to task-irrelevant noise. We hypothesized that individuals with DST would be more sensitive to cognitive load, showing a greater increase in their neural responses to noise as cognitive load increases. Because DST comprises multiple subjective symptoms, we analyzed the associations with specific symptoms. Methods Thirteen adults with ASD and twenty-two adults without ASD participated in the study. Participants who self-reported auditory hypersensitivity were classified as the DST group. All participants completed a DST questionnaire with six subscales: excessive loudness, ear pain, fear, annoyance, attention control, and attention to detail. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by task-irrelevant noise were analyzed during an auditory n-back task. The n-back task included a low (1-back) and a high (2-back) cognitive load condition. Results The prevalence of self-reported DST was significantly higher in the ASD group than in controls. Individuals who reported DST also tended to experience other types of sensory hypersensitivity. Attentional functions were associated with fear, annoyance, and loudness perception of sounds, and ear pain appeared to function independently of other DST symptoms. Scores for attentional control difficulties related to DST did not correlate with performance on the n-back task, which reflects susceptibility to noise interference. Contrary to previous findings, N100 amplitude did not differ between task-load conditions and did not vary according to the presence of DST. P200 amplitude was larger in the 1-back than in the 2-back condition but did not differ by ASD diagnosis or DST status. Conclusions The presence of DST or ASD was not associated with cognitive capacity or with the auditory processing of task-irrelevant noise.

                Zhang et al. reveal that ZDHHC12-mediated palmitoylation negatively regulates PARP1-DNA binding and suppresses PARP1 trapping by PARP inhibitors. Blocking PARP1 palmitoylation enhances PARP inhibitor sensitivity in ovarian cancer models and overcomes resistance conferred by patient-derived PARP1 mutations (R138C/R591C), revealing a targetable therapeutic vulnerability.

">Δ⁹-Tetrahydrocannabinol-induced enhancement of reward responsivity via mesocorticolimbic modulation in squirrel monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products are widely used recreationally, partly due to THC's ability to enhance the appetitive (i.e., rewarding) properties of diverse stimuli. However, the neural mechanisms through which THC modulates reward-related processing remain poorly understood. Here, we used a Pavlovian paradigm in adult squirrel monkeys (3males, 1female) to associate a visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) with appetitive food delivery. The modulatory effects of acute THC (1-10g/kg, i.m.) on behavioral and brain responses to CS+ were evaluated. Event-related functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to characterize the neural correlates of conditioned responding to the CS+, both in the absence and presence of THC treatment, with pre-conditioning scans serving as control. Behaviorally, THC (3g/kg) selectively enhanced conditioned responding to the CS+ without altering responses to the control stimulus (CS-) or increasing baseline consummatory responding, underscoring the specificity of THC's action on reward-associated processes. Consistently, fMRI analyses revealed that THC amplified CS+-evoked activation within mesocorticolimbic regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, hippocampus, and substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA), without affecting activity in visual and motor cortices. This finding underscores the selectivity of THC's neuromodulatory effects on reward-related circuitry. Independent of CS exposure, resting-state functional connectivity analyses indicate that THC enhanced mesocorticolimbic network integration, as evident in strengthened SN-VTA-centered connectivity with the ACC, striatum, and hippocampus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that THC enhances the responses to appetitive stimuli, through selective modulation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry, highlighting the SN-VTA as a pivotal hub for cannabinoid-mediated regulation of incentive salience and motivational drive toward reward-associated stimuli.

">Ketone bodies mitigate against systemic inflammation-induced changes in brain energy metabolism and delirium-like deficits in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Acute systemic inflammation affects brain function, with detrimental consequences in aged individuals. These include delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating disturbances in attention, perception and cognition. Delirium is associated with disrupted brain energy metabolism but our understanding of this during acute systemic inflammation is limited. Here we hypothesized that LPS-induced systemic inflammation would disrupt brain energy metabolism in aged C57BL6J mice and that the consequent functional impairments would be mitigated by ketone body utilization. We investigated ketone body effects in sickness behaviour, inflammation, energy metabolism and cognitive function. Real-time changes in utilisation of energy sources were quantified by indirect calorimetry and administration of radioisotope-labelled glucose and betahydroxybutyrate. Mass-spectrometry metabolomics was used to index severity of behavioural distrurbances to changes in hippocampal energy metabolism. LPS precipitated hypoglycemia and induced a whole-body switch from carbohydrate to lipid utilisation. Despite this, hippocampal insulin resistance and preserved brain glucose was observed while alternative carbohydrates, mannose and fructose, became depleted. Ketone ester treatment reversed insulin resistance, mitigated sickness behaviour and prevented delirium-like cognitive dysfunction without altering pro-inflammatory responses. Our results show that promoting ketone body usage mitigates systemic inflammation-induced brain energy disruption and prevents delirium-like cognitive deficits in aged mice.

">State-Dependent Dissociation of Shared Input and Directed Information Flow in the Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how brain state and sensory input shape inter-laminar communication is essential for interpreting cortical population dynamics. Using laminar recordings in macaque V1, we apply reduced-rank regression to quantify low-dimensional predictive subspaces linking Input and Superficial layers. We find that both visual stimulation and internal state (eyes open vs. closed) modulate the structure and efficacy of these subspaces, but through distinct mechanisms. Visual input induces a directional, feedforward pattern from input to superficial layers, while wakefulness-related modulation enhances coordination more symmetrically. Delay analysis and network simulations confirm that structured, layer-specific inputs produce directional prediction, whereas global fluctuations yield undirected co-activation. Importantly, differential structure across layers predicts the emergence of communication asymmetry. These findings dissociate communication from shared modulation, providing a principled framework for interpreting inter-population correlations. Our results generalize to broader cortical circuits, offering insights into when population coupling reflects genuine information flow versus global state dynamics.

">Exogenously driven neural reactivation of spatially matching visual working-memory contents</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention is often divided into voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) forms, a distinction extensively studied for attention to external sensory input. In contrast, internal selective attention--directed toward representations held in working memory (WM)--has been considered primarily for voluntary influences. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that task-irrelevant external stimuli can also influence internal selection of feature-matching WM representations involuntarily, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we tested whether an uninformative exogenous spatial retro-cue presented during a WM delay can act as a selective ''ping'' and reactivate spatially matching WM content at the level of its representational category. Male and female human participants memorized complex contents presented at distinct locations, followed by unpredictive and task-irrelevant spatial retro-cues that conveyed no category information. Using temporally resolved multivariate EEG decoding, we observed category-specific reactivation of spatially matching WM representations following these cues, providing direct neural evidence for stimulus-driven, involuntary attentional selection within WM, ahead of the memory test. Moreover, neural responses to the subsequent memory-probe were also modulated by cue congruency, consistent with the notion that exogenous influences begin early during sensory processing while also shaping later decision-related processes. Finally, drift-diffusion model analyses revealed that this involuntary cueing effect was primarily driven by increased evidence accumulation. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which external events can automatically and involuntarily penetrate the internal cognitive workspace.

">PRO-FitS: a novel phenotypic assay to identify enhancers of proteostasis in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) continues to rise with the aging of populations worldwide, representing a pressing need for the establishment of therapeutic strategies. Maintaining proteostasis is crucial for healthy aging, as the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a key contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction and disease. This study introduces a novel phenotypic assay using Caenorhabditis elegans to screen for small molecule enhancers of proteostasis, aiming at mitigating the proteotoxic stress associated with NDs. This new methodology- PRO-FitS- uses C. elegans motor activity as a proxy for the PROteome Fitness State upon a noxious protein-denaturating stimulus, while allowing a fast and experimenter-free readout. We demonstrate the efficacy of the assay by validating the role of pharmacological mTOR inhibition and serotonergic signaling activation in reducing heat shock-induced proteotoxic damage at the whole-organism level. PRO-FitS will allow the identification of novel compounds that alleviate protein aggregation disorders, potentially revealing new pathways and cellular targets not previously implicated in proteotoxicity.

">Non-viral vasculogenic reprogramming restores cognition and mitigates pathology in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, synaptic loss, and profuse neuronal death. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that cerebrovascular impairment precedes the emergence of neuropathological hallmarks, implicating vascular dysfunction as an early contributor to AD onset and progression. We investigated a non-viral strategy to generate pro-vasculogenic fibroblasts by transiently overexpressing Etv2, Foxc2, and Fli1 (EFF) as a potential cell-based therapy for neurovascular deficits in AD. To assess therapeutic potential, EFF-primed fibroblasts were injected into a mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) and wild-type controls via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route, followed by cognitive assessments and subsequent brain tissue analyses. Our findings demonstrate that EFF-primed fibroblasts acquire vasculogenic properties, enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF), and alleviate spatial memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, transplanted EFF-primed fibroblasts exhibited long-term survival, integrated into the brain vasculature, and promoted cortical vascular remodeling in the AD brain. Notably, ICV deployment of these cells is also correlated with reduced cortical A{beta} load, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits in reducing AD pathology. Transcriptomic analysis identified the activation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as Ppar, known for its anti-amyloidogenic and anti-inflammatory effects. Collectively, these findings highlight non-viral, reprogramming-based vasculogenic cell therapy as a promising strategy for AD, capable of alleviating cognitive decline and addressing AD pathology across cellular and tissue scales

">Understanding corticosterone fluctuations and HPA-axis regulation in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet expansion in the ATXN3 gene, primarily characterized by motor impairments. However, SCA3/MJD also includes mood-related comorbidities that affect both patients and their caregivers. Current treatments focus on symptom management and supportive care, as no disease-modifying therapies are available. Previously, we have demonstrated decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in post-mortem SCA3 human and mouse brains and elevated peripheral corticosterone (CORT) levels in SCA3 mice at late disease stages. Impaired GR signaling is typically associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, common in stress-related psychiatric diseases. Our study aimed to dissect the HPA-axis (dys)function and the effect of stress exposure on SCA3/MJD progression. Using the CMVMJD135 mouse model, we evaluated HPA-axis regulation in SCA3/MJD by measuring CORT levels throughout disease progression (6 to 34 weeks of age) under basal conditions and after acute stress. At week 35, these mice underwent a dexamethasone injection to challenge the HPA-axis, and the CORT levels were measured at different timepoints to evaluate the axis response. Additionally, we applied a 6-week chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol in another cohort of mice starting at an early symptomatic stage to assess stress effects on the progression of motor impairments. Our findings indicate that serum CORT levels in SCA3 mice begin to rise between 26 to 30 weeks of age, with no impairment in the physiological response to acute stress. SCA3 mice were also able to normalize CORT levels after dexamethasone challenge, suggesting normal HPA-axis function. While CUS exposure had a transient negative impact on the motor phenotype, this effect did not persist throughout disease progression. In conclusion, stressful events, either acute or chronic, do not seem to be major determinants of disease severity in SCA3 mice.

">The 	C. elegans nervous system reads the internal state of the hydrogen peroxide-detoxification machinery to trigger escape from this common reactive chemical</a></h4>

              
                Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the most common reactive chemical threat faced by organisms. Here, we map the neural circuit that drives chemotactic escape from environmental H2O2 in the nematode C. elegans. Twenty-four neuron classes with sensory endings at the mouth and nose of the animal detect H2O2. Their response dynamics encode stimulus intensity and exposure history, and their partial redundancy makes avoidance resilient to the loss of individual inputs. Sensing begins when H2O2 oxidizes the peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of the cytosolic peroxiredoxin PRDX-2, which relays this oxidative signal to cysteines on the LITE-1 and GUR-3 ion channels, triggering calcium influx in sensory neurons that drive escape. Most of these neurons release glutamate to drive H2O2-dependent excitation of AIA interneurons, whereas others signal through non-glutamatergic routes, providing multiple routes for signal transmission. Thus, the C. elegans nervous system acts as a hydrogen peroxide sentinel that monitors H2O2-induced changes in the intracellular H2O2-detoxification machinery and relays them to interneurons driving organism-wide escape. This raises the possibility that circuit defects in aging and neurodegenerative disease arise from altered peroxiredoxin-mediated H2O2 signaling rather than primarily from direct macromolecular damage.

                This study presents a stereotactic microbiopsy technique for sampling defined brain regions in living mice, enabling transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses without sacrificing the animal. The method will allow pre-intervention tissue collection, making it possible to separate preexisting molecular differences from experience- or treatment-induced changes. We show that microbiopsies yield sufficient, high-quality RNA and chromatin for sequencing, with minimal tissue damage that largely resolves over time. The procedure uses standard stereotactic equipment and achieves reproducible spatial precision when the syringe is stabilised. This approach provides a practical framework for within-subject molecular comparisons, reducing animal use and enabling longitudinal profiling of the living mouse brain. It establishes a foundation for investigating how baseline molecular states influence later physiological or behavioural outcomes.

">Uncovering Dynamic Neural Information Flow with Continuous-Time Weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how information dynamically flows within neural systems is a crucial problem in neuroscience. Traditional approaches often assume stationary or quasi-stationary functional networks, which fail to capture the time-varying dynamics of interactions among neural variables. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous-Time weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks (CTwDBN), a non-stationary graphical modeling framework for uncovering smoothly time-varying conditional dependencies. Validation on synthetic datasets demonstrated that CTwDBN reliably recovers the structure and dynamics of ground-truth information flow. Application to electrophysiological recordings during a guided saccade task revealed temporal fluctuations in conditional dependencies in the cortical network that persisted an order of magnitude longer than the receptive field dynamics. In the resting-state cortex, CTwDBN revealed persistent fluctuations within a low-dimensional dependency space reflecting canonical anatomical motifs. These results highlight CTwDBN as a versatile analytical framework for capturing dynamic information flow in neural systems with broad applicability to complex biological and artificial systems.

">When the brightest is not the best: illuminant estimation from the geometry of specular highlights</a></h4>

              
                Color constancy allows us to perceive stable object colors under different lighting conditions by reducing the impact of lighting. Information about illuminant color could be derived from a white surface or a specular highlight. The 'brightest is white' heuristic has been frequently incorporated in illumination estimation models, to identify illuminant color. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis: we use structured changes in the proximal image to identify highlight regions, even when they are not the brightest elements in the scene. In computer-rendered scenes, we varied the reliability of 'brightest element' and 'highlight geometry' cues, testing their effect on a color constancy task. Each scene had a single spherical surface lit by several point lights with identical spectral properties. The surface had a uniform spectral reflectance but a noise texture that attenuated the reflectance by a variable scale factor. We tested three levels of specularity: zero (matte), low, and mid. Observers watched a 1.5-second animation and responded if color changes were due to illuminant or material changes. Discrimination performance for matte surfaces was nearly at chance level, as predicted. However, as specularity increased, performance improved significantly. Observers outperformed an ideal observer model who relied solely on the brightest element. Notably, when the specular region appeared on a dark part of the texture, observer performance improved even more even though the brightest element heuristic would predict a decrease. When specular geometries were difficult to identify due to phase scrambling, observer performance significantly dropped. These results suggest that we do not simply rely on the brightest element, but rather utilize regularities of diffuse and specular components of the proximal image to solve surface and illuminant ambiguities.

                Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied over the cervical or lumbar spinal cord facilitates motor function after paralysis. However, emerging electrophysiological evidence indicates mechanistic differences between cervical and lumbar tSCS and across different cervical tSCS paradigms. To clarify these discrepancies, we developed and validated a multi-scale, whole-body computational model of tSCS-induced volume conduction, axonal recruitment, and synaptic transmission. Across 24 cervical and four lumbar tSCS paradigms, simulations showed that somatosensory afferents consistently exhibit lower stimulation thresholds than motor efferents. In turn, region-specific synaptic transmission differences may explain electrophysiological discrepancies between cervical and lumbar tSCS. Across cervical tSCS paradigms, substantial volume conduction and axonal recruitment differences were observed that explain electrophysiological discrepancies. Specifically, clinically-prevalent paradigms, including those with anodes placed over the clavicles or iliac crests, engaged peripheral nerves in addition to spinal roots. This effect was amplified by multiphasic waveforms, which introduced recruitment sites near the anodes. By integrating simulations with electrophysiological recordings in 14 able-bodied individuals, we investigated previously unexplored cervical tSCS paradigms on their capacity to recruit somatosensory afferents relative to motor threshold.

">Hippocampal tangential insertions of high-density silicone probes in head-fixed mice enhance spatial sampling</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a key structure within the medial temporal lobe which plays a central role in the formation and consolidation of declarative memories. Despite technological progress, a full understanding of hippocampal rhythms, neuronal population activity, and the underlying connectivity remain elusive, partly due to its complex morphology in a croissant-like shape which limits coronal and sagittal approaches. To address this limitation, we propose two different tangential insertions of high-density electrode probes aligned to either the dorsal or ventral sections of the hippocampus. Each approach enables the placement of up to 384 recording sites within the hippocampal formation. Both insertions are performed in head-fixed condition, which further allows for detailed monitoring of the animals behavioral states, including spontaneous running and facial movements. The two proposed tangential dorsal and ventral insertions capture almost continuously the physiology of the hippocampus across 3.84 mm of tissue. When placed across the pyramidal layer, such insertions can harness ripple oscillations over 120 channels, corresponding to approximately ~1.2 mm of tissue, with a coverage of 2 channels every 20 micrometer. Furthermore, such insertions enabled us to record up to 400 hippocampal neurons simultaneously from a single probe, endowing us with the capability to capture within a single recording several hundreds of functionally connected neuronal pairs. Lastly, these insertions were performed in head-fixed mice on a running band, which can be combined with high frequency sampling camera, allowing us to precisely monitor facial movements, and their hippocampal correlates. An orthogonal/vertical approach is a more standard way to record electrophysiological activity from most brain regions, including the hippocampus. Vertical insertions thereby miss the antero-posterior axis of the brain in the hippocampus and therefore putative propagating events. Furthermore, vertical insertions have a lower reach in terms of number of channels, single units, and spatial density being recorded, even with multi-shank high-density probes. Tangential insertions therefore substantially increase spatial reach and resolution, which leads to a higher number of cells recorded in a single insertion along the antero-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, compared to freely moving approaches, head-fixed conditions enable precise monitoring of facial movements. Dorsal and ventral head-fixed tangential insertions of Neuropixels probes in the hippocampus increase the resolution and spatial extent of recordings, allowing more precise and extensive monitoring of network activity and its underlying connectivity.

                Failure of remyelination drives neurodegeneration in demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), with disrupted lipid handling and metabolic stress in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) posing major barriers to repair. Here, we identify the dual ApoC-II mimetic- ApoC-III antagonist peptide D6PV as a metabolic modulator that directly enhances OPC differentiation and myelin repair. Across ex vivo and in vivo models of chemically induced demyelination, D6PV promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and restores myelin integrity independently of lipoprotein hydrolysis or modulation of lipid droplet-containing phagocytes. Guided by transcriptomics analyses, we find that D6PV stimulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, while suppressing inflammatory transcriptional programs, thereby driving OPCs toward a myelinating phenotype. Notably, D6PV does not alter peripheral immune composition or autoimmune-driven pathology in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, indicating a central nervous system (CNS) cell-autonomous effect. These findings reveal a metabolism-linked pathway for remyelination and position D6PV as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance CNS repair in demyelinating diseases.

">Gamma oscillations across recording scales show a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in the primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-induced narrowband gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) arise due to excitatory-inhibitory interactions and have been proposed to carry feedforward prediction errors during visual processing. However, the dependence of gamma on stimulus color is not well characterized, with some studies showing a preference for saturated long-wavelength (reddish) hues in invasive recordings from the primary visual cortex (V1), while others showing no preference for red in luminance and cone-contrast balanced colors spanning the Derrington-Krauskopf-Lennie (DKL) isoluminant plane in non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. To address these discrepancies, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from V1 (n=2 monkeys) along with scalp electroencephalography (EEG), while presenting luminance-matched hues spanning the entire permissible range of colors. We found that saturated reddish hues produced the strongest gamma in both LFP and EEG in both monkeys. However, gamma was reduced when the colors were desaturated, so that selectivity for reddish hues was diminished or absent on the DKL space, as shown previously. Interestingly, selectivity was further reduced in EEG compared to LFP. Simultaneous recordings from an intermediate visual area (V4, n=1) revealed weak color-induced gamma, partially explaining the weakening of hue selectivity in macro-signals. Gamma power increased with increasing activation along the red-green (L-M) cardinal axis but was virtually absent along the blue-yellow (S-(L+M)) axis, suggesting that gamma could be a reflection of the L-M cone-contrast mechanism. These results comprehensively resolve the earlier discrepancy and shed light about the neural mechanisms underlying gamma generation in primate V1.

">Standardized brain and plasma EV enrichment pipeline validated for Single sample multi-Omic and fatty acids applications in Mouse and Human</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication, yet their molecular profiles across tissues and species remain poorly characterized, particularly due to currently available methods requiring a large amount of biological material (tissue or biofluids). Here, we established a workflow allowing the deep phenotyping of EV cargos starting from single samples of human and mouse origin. We took advantage of standardised EV isolation procedures and multi-omic techniques for the isolation and analysis of EVs from brain and plasma of human and mouse, integrating flow cytometric profiling, proteomics, miRNA sequencing, and fatty acid profiling. Here we report specific brain-derived EVs proteome, enriched in neuronal and glial proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids profiles, and distinct miRNAs. At the periphery, we also report plasma-derived EVs signatures reflecting immune, metabolic, and systemic transport functions. Despite these expected material-specific differences, EVs from the same source displayed greater similarity across species than EVs from different material, supporting the translational relevance of mouse models. Importantly, using state-of-the-art miRNA profiling approach, we identified novel EV-specific miRNAs in human and mouse brain EVs, potentially allowing the exploration of new roles in neuronal signalling. Overall, we report here a method enabling deep multi-omic characterization from minimal starting material, offering a practical approach for studies with limited biological samples. These findings also demonstrate that the origin strongly shapes EV composition, highlighting conserved and species-specific molecular features, and provide a scalable framework for multi-omic investigations of EV biology.

                <p>Episodic timing refers to the one-shot, automatic encoding of temporal information in the brain, in the absence of attention to time. A previous magnetoencephalography (MEG) study showed that the relative burst time of spontaneous alpha oscillations (&alpha;) during quiet wakefulness was a selective predictor of retrospective duration estimation. This observation was interpreted as &alpha; embodying the "ticks" of an internal contextual clock. Herein, we replicate and extend these findings using electroencephalography (EEG), assess robustness to time-on-task effects, and test the generalizability in virtual reality (VR) environments. In three EEG experiments, 128 participants of either sex underwent 4&nbsp;min eyes-open resting-state recordings followed by an unexpected retrospective duration estimation task. Experiment 1 tested participants before any tasks, Experiment 2 after 90&nbsp;min of timing tasks, and Experiment 3 in VR environments of different sizes. We successfully replicated the original MEG findings in Experiment 1 but did not in Experiment 2. We explain the lack of replication through time-on-task effects (changes in &alpha; power and topography) and contextual changes yielding a cognitive strategy based on temporal expectation (supported by a fast passage of time). In Experiment 3, we did not find the expected duration underestimation in VR and did not replicate the correlation between &alpha; bursts and retrospective time estimates. Overall, while EEG captures the &alpha; burst marker of episodic timing, its reliability depends critically on experimental context. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling experimental context when using &alpha; bursts as a neural marker of episodic timing.</p>

                With increasing concern about the environmental and social impacts of the food industry, sustainability has become a central focus of scientific research. To better understand how this field has evolved, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to identify publication trends, key themes, and emerging topics. The analysis was based on data from Scopus and Web of Science and examined the evolution of scientific output related to sustainability in the food industry. Methods included keyword co-occurrence analysis, assessments of country and author productivity, and thematic evolution analysis. In addition, a Cartesian framework was used to classify key terms according to their relevance and recency. The results show an exponential growth in scientific output, with notable increases in 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, reaching a statistical significance of 99.65%. Three main country clusters were identified, with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy standing out for their productivity and impact. At the author level, Mangla and Luthra were the most productive, while Land, Beske, and Van Der Vorst had the greatest impact on the field. Thematic evolution analysis revealed a transition from early research focused on “soil erosion” to more recent themes such as “circular economy,” “supply chain management,” “food safety,” and “wastewater treatment.” The keyword co-occurrence network identified seven thematic clusters, with the most prominent cluster centered on “sustainability,” “waste management,” and “short supply chain.” Emerging topics included “Covid-19,” “blockchain,” and the “agri-food sector.” Overall, the study demonstrates a clear evolution and diversification of sustainability research in the food industry, underscoring the importance of emerging topics and international collaboration. It also proposes a multidisciplinary research agenda that prioritizes food security, sustainable agriculture, and supply chain management, and emphasizes the integration of innovative technologies to address current environmental, economic, and social challenges.

                Background Ruminal impaction is a serious digestive disorder in sheep, leading to systemic metabolic acidosis and, as a consequence, widespread physiological disturbances. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative parameters in a local Iraqi sheep that was suffering from ruminal impaction. Methods A case control study was performed in 20 adult female sheep (Awassi sheep breeder) (10 ruminal impaction and 10 control) diagnosed with in Fallujah, Iraq, based on clinical signs and confirmed by laboratory findings of hyperkalaemia. The control group consisted of sheep of age, sex and weight consistent with clinically normal sheep. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected, and serum was analyzed for electrolytes, biochemical and oxidative markers using established laboratory methods. Results The impacted animals showed significant increases (P≤0.05) in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), glucose, urea, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate and significant decreases (P≤0.05) in albumin, cholesterol, sodium, chloride, and calcium levels, where serum level of magnesium did not show any significant difference between the groups. In addition, oxidative stress was present as there was a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Background These findings indicate a pathogenesis cascade whereby ingestion of poorly digested food causes ruminal stasis, systemic acidosis, liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, oxidative stress and oxidative stress. Using a single biomarker may underestimate the true severity of the disease, while combining biochemical, electrolyte and oxidative measurements provides a more complete picture.

                Microalgae are increasingly recognized as sustainable green cell factories capable of producing a various high-value bioactive compounds. Among them, the red microalga Porphyridium purpureum stands out for its unique ability to secrete sulfated exopolysaccharides (sEPS)—complex macromolecules enriched with sulfate and uronic acid groups that exhibit potent biological activities. These compounds function as natural antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobial agents, attracting substantial interest from the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and functional food industries. A targeted literature search was conducted across the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases to identify studies focusing on the extraction, structural characterization, and applications of sulfated exopolysaccharides from Porphyridium purpureum between 2015 and 2025. Recent research has demonstrated rapid advancements in environmentally friendly extraction technologies, including membrane filtration, three-phase partitioning (TPP), ultrasound-assisted TPP (UATPP), and deep eutectic solvents (DES), which collectively enhance the yield, purity, and preserve the biological functionality of sEPS. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in structural and mechanistic elucidation through advanced analytical and imaging techniques such as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, methylation analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. These approaches have clarified how cultivation parameters and environmental stressors influence EPS biosynthesis, sulfation patterns, and biological activity. Overall, this review provides an integrated and forward-looking perspective on the scientific advances and technological challenges surrounding P. purpureum sEPS, outlining future directions toward sustainable bioprocessing and industrial valorization of these high-value biomacromolecules.

                <p>by Tengfei Ji, Bo Yang, Meng Wang, Hong Ji, Huazhe Yang, Yizhuo Liu</p>

Spatial transcriptomics enables the measurement of gene expression in intact tissues. Despite this, reconstructing anatomically accurate spatial domains remains challenging, primarily due to expression sparsity, complex tissue architecture that is characterized by sharp boundaries and long-range continuity, and weak spatial signals. Traditional pipelines typically rely on expression-driven clustering and spatial smoothing, which underperform at boundaries and in sparse regions while neglecting morphological information. To address these challenges, AugGCL is proposed, an augmented graph-convolutional learning framework that enhances spatial structure decoding and gene expression reconstruction through targeted augmentation of both gene and image data. A key component of AugGCL is neighborhood information aggregation mechanism, which integrates expression similarity and spatial proximity to construct a weighted graph and an enhanced expression matrix, addressing sparsity without sacrificing boundary clarity. Additionally, a two stream weighted graph convolutional network jointly models refined gene features and image-derived morphological information, with image-aware auxiliary reconstructions enhancing weak spatial signals and sharpening boundaries. On datasets from the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, breast cancer, and mouse embryo, AugGCL outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, showing robustness and generalization across a range of datasets. Downstream analysis validated the reliability of the method, confirming its effectiveness in cell annotation, functional enrichment, and mechanistic studies. AugGCL generates clearer spatial domains and significantly advances the application of spatial transcriptomics in tissue structure and disease research.

                <p>by Haneol Cho, Junho Lee, Sean Lawler, Yangjin Kim</p>

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer with the very poor survival and high recurrence rate. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a pivotal role in regulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a new mathematical model of the critical GBM-TAN interaction in the heterogeneous brain tissue. The model reveals that the dual and complex role of TANs (either anti-tumorigenic N1 and the pro-tumorigenic N2 type) regulates the phenotypic trajectory of the evolution of tumor growth and the invasive patterns in white and gray matter via mediators such as IFN-<i>β</i> and TGF-<i>β</i>. We investigated the effect of normalizing the immune environment on glioma growth by applying a therapeutic antibody and developed several strategies for eradication of tumor cells by neutrophil-mediated transport of nanoparticles. We also developed a strategy of combination therapy (surgery + Trojan neutrophils) for effective control of the infiltration of the glioma cells in one hemisphere before crossing the corpus callosum (CC) in order to prevent recurrence in the other hemisphere. This alternative approach compared to the extended resection of the glioma including CC or butterfly GBM may provide the greater anti-tumor efficacy and reduce side effects such as cognitive impairment.

                <p>by Daniel Shani, Peter Dayan</p>

Egocentric representations of the environment have historically been relegated to being used only for simple forms of spatial behaviour such as stimulus-response learning. However, in the many cases that critical aspects of policies are best defined relative to the self, egocentric representations can be advantageous. Furthermore, there is evidence that forms of egocentric representation might exist in the wider hippocampal formation. Nevertheless, egocentric representations have yet to be fully incorporated as a component of modern navigational methods. Here we investigate egocentric successor representations (SRs) and their combination with allocentric representations. We build a reinforcement learning agent that combines an egocentric SR with a conventional allocentric SR to navigate complex 2D environments. We demonstrate that the agent learns generalisable egocentric and allocentric value functions which, even when only additively composed, allow it to learn policies efficiently and to adapt to new environments quickly. Our work shows the benefit for egocentric relational structure to be captured, as well as allocentric. We offer a new perspective on how cognitive maps could usefully be composed from multiple simple maps representing associations between state features defined in different reference frames.

The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is important for cell health. Mutations in genes that are required for mitophagy, including <i>Vps13D</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>Parkin</i>, are associated with movement disorders, but gaps exist in our understanding of how Vps13D regulates mitophagy. Here, we identify Mtch (MTCH2 in humans) as a regulator of mitophagy based on a relationship with Vps13D during developmentally programmed mitophagy in <i>Drosophila</i> intestine enterocyte cells. Similar to <i>Vps13D</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> mutant cells fail to clear mitochondria and possess elevated markers of autophagy. Genetic and molecular experiments reveal that Mtch and Vps13D function in a mitophagy pathway with PINK1, Parkin, and the mitophagy receptor BNIP3. Unlike <i>Vps13D</i> and <i>Parkin</i> mutant cells, <i>Mtch</i> is required for proper expression of the tail-anchored protein BNIP3. Thus, the tail-anchored protein insertase function of Mtch/MTCH2 likely explains how these proteins possess multiple cell context-specific functions.

                <p>by Yanhua Zhao, Meiting Zhang, Yan You, Jinrong Zhang, Yuning Ji, Lei Lei</p>

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a valuable tool in regenerative medicine, yet its efficiency remains limited by epigenetic reprogramming barriers that have been partially corrected by global regulation of epigenetic enzymes. However, these approaches lack gene locus specificity and may disrupt normal gene regulation. Therefore, new strategies capable of broadly enhancing reprogramming fidelity are needed. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the pioneer transcription factor Nr5a2 in mouse SCNT embryos improves both zygotic genome activation and the morula-to-blastocyst transition, two major developmental barriers in SCNT, and enhances birth rates. Mechanistically, Nr5a2 recruits P300 to increase H3K27ac at genes with low expression, restoring transcriptional activity and promoting SCNT embryo development.

                <p>by Dinh Nhan Lai, Xi Yang, Chong Xie, Ting Li, An Yan, Xing Liu, Yun Zhou</p>

Land plants alternate between generations of asexual sporophytes and sexual gametophytes. Unlike seed plants, ferns produce free-living gametophytes that grow independently from their sporophytes. Gametophytes of the model fern <i>Ceratopteris</i> exist in two sex types: hermaphrodites and males. Hermaphrodites maintain meristems and secrete the pheromone antheridiogen, inducing undecided gametophytes to become males. In the absence of antheridiogen, males exhibit developmental plasticity and dynamic cell fate specification by initiating de novo meristems to convert into hermaphrodites. Despite its essential role, the molecular signals governing this process remain unclear. Here, we show that local auxin biosynthesis, dynamically regulated during sex-type conversion, establishes new auxin maxima that are critical for specifying and promoting the proliferation of the meristem progenitor cell (MPC) lineage, ultimately enabling the de novo formation of a multicellular meristem from a single MPC. Time-lapse imaging revealed that upon antheridiogen removal, auxin signaling is specifically activated at the initial site of proliferation in <i>Ceratopteris</i> males, triggering new meristem formation. This auxin signaling subsequently becomes concentrated at the center of the proliferating meristem, aligning with localized auxin biosynthesis and the emergence of the meristem notch. Computationally reconstrued lineage maps further showed that chemical inhibition of CrTAA1 abolishes these dynamic auxin patterns, blocking MPC lineage initiation and its subsequent proliferation. Furthermore, genetic knockout of <i>CrTAA1</i> via CRISPR-Cas9 phenocopies the effects of chemical inhibition, preventing new meristem formation and disrupting male-to-hermaphrodite conversion. Together, these findings uncover a molecular mechanism underlying sex-type conversion in land plants and highlight the pivotal role of de novo auxin biosynthesis in orchestrating cell fate and proliferation during meristem formation.

                <p>Cladribine tablets are approved for relapsing multiple sclerosis, mediating their clinical effect by moderately depleting lymphocytes. In a prospective, monocentric study including 22 patients completing 2 annual cycles of cladribine, B- and T-cell receptor repertoires and relapse activity were assessed at baseline and after 24 months. T-cell clonality increased, driven by loss of low-frequency, naive clonotypes, and re-expansion of dominant CD8 memory clonotypes, particularly in clinically stable patients. In contrast, B-cell receptor richness increased because of reconstruction by transitional and naive B cells with higher clonotype numbers observed in relapsing patients. Therefore, competing immune reconstitution following cladribine therapy could result in differential clinical responses. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background The effectiveness of information systems in enhancing user performance is influenced by various factors, including system quality, service quality, and user satisfaction. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has been proposed as a moderator in this relationship, though its impact remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the moderating role of POS on the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, specifically in the context of Approweb, an information system used by account representatives at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) in Jakarta. Methods A quantitative research approach with an explanatory design was adopted to examine causal relationships among the variables. The theoretical framework was based on the DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (2003), with POS incorporated from the socio-technical perspective. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey from 329 Account Representatives (ARs) using a probability sampling method Results The study found that both system quality and service quality significantly influence user satisfaction and user performance. Moreover, POS was found to significantly moderate the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, enhancing the positive effects of both quality dimensions on performance. These results suggest that organizational support is a key factor in maximizing the benefits of information systems. Conclusions The findings confirm the critical role of system quality, service quality, and POS in improving user performance. POS was shown to amplify the positive effects of both system and service quality, indicating that users are more likely to perform effectively when they perceive strong organizational support. The study contributes to the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model by incorporating POS as a moderating factor and emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to system success that integrates both technical and social dimensions.

                Background Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their Blood Glucose (BG) to continually control their glycemia. They had to undergo a blood test at least twice a day using a finger prick, and must visit a laboratory every three months for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the constitution of Iraqi diabetes patients is 13.9%. An Internet of Things (IoT) based framework for non-invasive BG monitoring was recently developed. The aim is to enhance the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device by using IoT technologies. Methods Starting with a review of the latest IoT technologies and some of the CGM commercial devices recommended by ISO 15197 standard. A questionnaire sheet is distributed to determine how much patients in Iraq knew about their health situation and whether they are interested in using new IoT technologies. Women patients are volunteered to check their BG using both finger prick and a CGM device three times a day for comparing. The suggestion is to connect CGM to a personal smart device that has a method controlling alarm messages instead of CGM output. Results The results show how important to educate patients about new technologies. A CGM and finger prick results are checked for similarity using statistical package. Results are presented as (mean ± SD (standard deviation)), the findings demonstrated that, significantly at P < 0.05, there were no differences between the means for tests in both methods based on the standard Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report. Conclusion This study shows how Iraqi’s patients feel when using a CGM device with new IoT technologies. CGM output is accurate but appeared every 15 min which may be uncomfortable. A method is suggested to transfer CGM output to a smart device to be controlled by algorithms, so that an alarm message is showed every 8h in a normal situation rather than every 15 min. Moreover, GMI% can be calculated every two weeks using data stored in the cloud to estimate a patient’s HbA1c level by using Markov chain. This figure how BG levels are changing in a shorter timeframe, helping in fine-tune diabetes management plans.

                Abstract* Background Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in mathematics education has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, reflecting broader advances in machine learning, learning analytics, and generative AI. However, a comprehensive overview of publication trends, thematic structures, and collaborative patterns specific to mathematics education remains limited. Methods This study employed a bibliometric approach guided by the PRISMA protocol to systematically analyze research on AI and ITS in mathematics education published between 2001 and 2025. A total of 237 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers indexed in Scopus were identified, screened, and included. Bibliographic data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package to examine annual publication growth, author productivity, international collaboration networks, and thematic evolution through keyword co-occurrence and thematic mapping techniques. Results The findings indicate that research output grew slowly during the early 2000s but increased markedly after 2019, aligning with the global surge in interest in machine learning, large language models, and generative AI. Author productivity followed a typical long-tail distribution, with a small group of core authors contributing consistently over time. International collaboration was evident but uneven, dominated by a limited number of countries. Thematic analysis revealed two enduring pillars of the field: pedagogical approaches in mathematics education and technology-driven instructional systems. Emerging themes, including federated learning and adversarial machine learning, point to rising attention to privacy, security, and robustness in adaptive learning environments. STEM education and generative AI have also gained prominence in recent years. Conclusions The evolution of research on AI and ITS in mathematics education reflects a clear paradigm shift from traditional instruction toward adaptive, data-driven, and intelligent learning systems. While technological innovation continues to accelerate, the findings highlight the critical role of teachers’ pedagogical readiness in ensuring that AI-enhanced mathematics education remains effective, inclusive, and sustainable.

                This study investigated the relationship between parents perceptions of children’s values in Indonesian families, focusing on economic, social, emotional, and religious dimensions. The investigation was based on background factors, such as gender, location of residence, and education level, as well as correlations and regressions between dimensions of children’s values. The study participants consisted of 255 parents living in various urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Data were collected using the Children’s Values Scale adapted for the Indonesian context. The study findings showed that there were no significant differences in children’s perceptions of values based on gender or education level. However, there were significant differences based on location of residence, especially on economic and religious dimensions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between social and emotional dimensions, while a negative relationship was found between economic and emotional dimensions in some contexts. The results of multiple linear regression analysis using the Stepwise method showed that economic and religious dimensions had a significant impact on overall family relationship patterns. This study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence parents’ perceptions of children’s values to support effective and harmonious parenting in Indonesian families.

                Factors that promote inflammation in C9ORF72 mutation carriers with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have remained elusive. McCourt et al. identified pro-inflammatory forms of glycogen in gut contents of people with ALS/FTD and demonstrate that targeting glycogen in a C9orf72 mouse model extends lifespan and reduces neuroinflammation.

                Vold et al. studied two SNAP-25 variants with different clinical severity. Variants destabilize the SNARE complex and reduce binding to the Munc18-1:VAMP2:syntaxin-1 acceptor complex, with correlated effects on neurotransmitter release. Effects of co-expression of variant and wild-type SNAP-25 were modeled by assuming the co-existence of both species in a ring of SNARE complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106931">Doubling dolutegravir dosage reduces the viral reservoir in ART-treated people with HIV</a></h4>

              
                Whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) is always completely suppressive, or HIV might continue to replicate at low levels despite ART in some people with HIV (PWH), is still debated. Here, we intensified the ART regimen by doubling dolutegravir (DTG) dosage and investigated the impact of this strategy on HIV blood and tissue reservoirs, immune activation, and inflammation. Twenty HIV-infected adults, who had received a triple ART consisting of 50 mg DTG/600 mg abacavir/300 mg lamivudine pre-intensification and had been suppressed on ART for at least 2 years, were enrolled in a phase 2 randomized clinical trial (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a> identifier: NCT05351684). Half of them received an additional 50 mg of DTG for a period of 84 days. As expected, plasma and tissue DTG concentrations significantly increased during the study period in the intensified group but not in the control group. Accordingly, significant decreases in total HIV DNA, intact HIV DNA, and cell-associated unspliced (US) HIV RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as in the US RNA/total DNA ratio, were observed in the intensified group but not in the control group. Intensification also modestly reduced markers of immune activation and exhaustion but had no measurable impact on systemic or tissue inflammation. Together with this, intensification resulted in a temporary decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio that returned to baseline by day 84. Our results strongly suggest that the pre-intensification ART regimen was not completely suppressive. If confirmed in larger clinical trials, these results could have an impact on the clinical management of PWH and HIV curative strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104528">Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and, in turn, their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap, proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help account for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106402">HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferative response 24 weeks after early antiretroviral therapy initiation is associated with the subsequent reduction in the viral reservoir</a></h4>

              
                Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated in the acute phase of HIV infection (AHI) results in a smaller viral reservoir. However, the impact of early HIV-specific T-cell responses on long-term reservoir dynamics is less well characterized. Therefore, we measured the size of the viral reservoir and functionality of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses after the acute phase at 24 and 156 weeks after ART initiation in people with HIV who started treatment during AHI. A significant reduction in total and defective HIV DNA and a trend toward a reduction in intact HIV DNA were observed between 24 and 156 weeks. Functional CD8+ T-cell responses against HIV peptides Env, Gag, Nef, and Pol were maintained over 3 years after treatment initiation. The proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells at 24 weeks of ART was predictive of the degree of reduction in total and defective HIV DNA between 24 and 156 weeks, suggesting HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells may at least partially drive the decline of the viral reservoir. Therefore, enforcing HIV-specific immune responses as early as possible after diagnosis of AHI should be a central focus of HIV cure strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105214">Computational modelling identifies key determinants of subregion-specific dopamine dynamics in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Striatal dopamine (DA) release regulates reward-related learning and motivation and is believed to consist of a short-lived <i>phasic</i> and continuous <i>tonic</i> component. Here, we build a large-scale three-dimensional model of extracellular DA dynamics in dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS). The model predicts rapid dynamics in DS with little to no basal DA and slower dynamics in the VS enabling build-up of <i>tonic</i> DA levels. These regional differences do not reflect release-related phenomena but rather differential dopamine transporter (DAT) activity. Interestingly, our simulations posit DAT nanoclustering as a possible regulator of this activity. Receptor binding simulations show that D1 receptor occupancy follows extracellular DA concentration with milliseconds delay, while D2 receptors do not respond to brief pauses in firing but rather integrate DA signal over seconds. Summarised, our model distills recent experimental observations into a computational framework that challenges prevailing paradigms of striatal DA signalling.

">Towards a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Improving Phonological Processing in Developmental Dyslexia: An Exploratory Study</a></h4>

              
                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have immense potential regarding the provision of therapies for disorders of development, but to date have typically been created for non-linguistic disorders such as ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Here we present a BCI that aims to improve linguistic phonological processing in developmental dyslexia. Phonological 'deficits' are considered a core feature of dyslexia across languages. A non-invasive EEG-BCI relying on auditory inputs and visual feedback was developed to optimise brain patterns related to phonology (speech-sound processing). These patterns were identified using Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, which proposes that phonological difficulties in dyslexia are related to impaired auditory processing of amplitude envelope rise times and low-frequency speech envelope information <10 Hz. These impairments are thought to affect automatic features of speech processing from birth, impairing the development of a phonological system. Adults with and without a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia played the BCI for 16 sessions, and received pre- and post-testing regarding phonological awareness and single word and nonword reading skills. Significant associations between their BCI scores (a measure of BCI learning) and improvements in syllable stress discrimination, nonword reading and amplitude rise time discrimination were found. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.

">Large-scale brain network differences during deliberate and spontaneous mind-wandering in a sustained attention task: An electroencephalography source-level connectivity study</a></h4>

              
                Mind-wandering (MW), the shift of attention away from an ongoing task, can be classified as either deliberate or spontaneous, depending on whether these internal thoughts arise intentionally or unintentionally. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging-based resting state studies have shown that spontaneous MW traits are positively correlated with coupling within the default mode network (DMN), whereas deliberate MW traits are positively correlated with coupling both within the DMN and between the DMN and control- or attention-related networks. However, state-based functional connectivity during each MW episode remains unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigated how deliberate and spontaneous MW differentially involve state-based large-scale network interactions during a sustained attention task using electroencephalography (EEG), which captures rapid network dynamics. Thirty-one participants performed the gradual-onset continuous performance task using 64-channel EEG. Mental states were classified via experience-sampling probes as on-task, deliberate, or spontaneous MW. EEG data from 1-s pre-probe epochs were analyzed using source estimation and the weighted phase lag index to assess functional connectivity within and across the DMN, control network (CN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Relative to both spontaneous MW and the on-task state, deliberate MW was characterized by significantly stronger alpha band functional connectivity. A prominent connectivity cluster was centered on the right frontal operculum-insula of the SN, linking regions across the SN, CN, and DMN. In addition, deliberate MW exhibited enhanced SN-DAN-DMN coupling compared with the on-task state. By contrast, spontaneous MW did not show significant connectivity differences relative to the on-task state in any frequency band. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha band network interactions centered on the SN may contribute to the intentional regulation of internally directed thought during deliberate MW.

                <p>Mirror invariance is the cognitive tendency to perceive mirror-image objects as identical. Mirrored letters, however, are distinct orthographic units and must be identified as different despite having the same shape. Consistent with this phenomenon, a small, localized region in the ventral visual stream, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), exhibits repetition suppression to both identical and mirror pairs of objects but only to identical, not mirror, pairs of letters (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pegado et al., 2011</cross-ref>), a phenomenon named mirror invariance "breaking". The ability of congenitally blind individuals to "break" mirror invariance for pairs of mirrored Braille letters has been demonstrated behaviorally (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">de Heering et al., 2018</cross-ref>,   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Korczyk et al., 2024</cross-ref>). However, its neural underpinnings have not yet been investigated. Here, in an fMRI repetition suppression paradigm, congenitally blind individuals (8 males and 10 females) recognized pairs of everyday objects and Braille letters in identical ("p" and "p"), mirror ("p" and "q"), and different ("p" and "z") orientations. We found repetition suppression for identical and mirror pairs of everyday objects in the parietal and ventral-lateral occipital cortex, indicating that mirror-invariant object recognition engages the ventral visual stream in tactile modality as well. However, repetition suppression for identical but not mirrored pairs of Braille letters was found not in the VWFA, but in broad areas of the left parietal cortex and the lateral occipital cortex. These results suggest that reading-related orthographic processes in blind individuals depend on different neural computations than those of the sighted.</p>

                <p>by Junhui Peng, Li Zhao</p>

Proteins function through dynamic interactions with other proteins in cells, forming complex networks fundamental to cellular processes. While high-resolution and high-throughput methods have significantly advanced our understanding of how proteins interact with each other, the molecular details of many important protein-protein interactions are still poorly characterized, especially in non-mammalian species, including <i>Drosophila</i>. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have enabled the prediction of molecular details in various cellular pathways at the network level. In this study, we used AlphaFold2 multimer to examine and predict protein-protein interactions from both physical and functional datasets in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that functional associations contribute significantly to high-confidence predictions. Through detailed structural analysis, we also found the importance of intrinsically disordered regions in the predicted high-confidence interactions. Our study highlights the importance of disordered regions in protein-protein interactions and demonstrates the importance of incorporating functional interactions in predicting physical interactions between proteins. We further compiled an interactive web interface to present the predictions, facilitating functional exploration, comparative analysis, and the generation of mechanistic hypotheses for future studies.

                <p>by Constandina Koki, Alessio V. Inchingolo, Abdullahi Daniyan, Enyu Li, Andrew D. McAinsh, Nigel J. Burroughs</p>

Mitosis is a complex self-organising process that achieves high fidelity separation of duplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells through capture and alignment of chromosomes to the spindle mid-plane. Chromosome movements are driven by kinetochores (KTs), multi-protein machines that attach chromosomes to microtubules (MTs), and through those attachments both control and generate directional forces. Using lattice light sheet microscopy imaging and automated near-complete tracking of kinetochores at fine spatio-temporal resolution, we produce a detailed atlas of kinetochore metaphase-anaphase dynamics in untransformed human cells (RPE1). Such data allows dynamic models to be reverse engineered and biological hypotheses to be addressed. We determined the support from this dataset for 17 models of metaphase dynamics using Bayesian inference, demonstrating (1) substantial sister asymmetry that generates transverse organisation of the metaphase plate (MPP), (2) substantial spatial organisation of KT dynamic properties within the MPP, and (3) significant time dependence of the K-fiber mechanical parameters whereby K-fiber forces tune over the last 5 mins of metaphase towards a set point, referred to as the anaphase ready state. These spatio-temporal trends are robust to perturbation of the spindle assembly pathway (nocodazole washout treatment), suggesting that the underlying processes generating kinetochore heterogeneity are intrinsic to mitosis and possibly play a role in ensuring high-fidelity segregation.

                <p>by Pranav Mahajan, Peter Dayan, Ben Seymour</p>

Injuries are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life, leading to an evolutionary mandate for powerful homeostatic processes of recovery and recuperation. The physiological responses of the body and the immune system must be coordinated with behaviour to allow protected time for this to happen, and to prevent further damage to the affected bodily parts. Reacting appropriately requires an internal control system that represents the nature and state of the injury and specifies and withholds actions accordingly. We bring the formal uncertainties embodied in this system into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process. We discuss nociceptive phenomena in light of this analysis, noting particularly the counter-intuitive behaviours associated with injury investigation, and the propensity for transitions from normative, tonic, to pathological, chronic pain states. Importantly, these simulation results provide a quantitative account and enable us to sketch a much needed roadmap for future theoretical and experimental studies on injury, tonic pain, and the transition to chronic pain.

                <p>by Upama Aich, Chloe Tan, Rebecca Bathgate, Khandis R. Blake, Robert C. S. Capp, Jacob C. Kuek, Bob B. M. Wong, Brian S. Mautz, Michael D. Jennions</p>

Why the human penis is unusually large compared to that of other primates is a long-standing evolutionary question. Sexual selection, through female mate choice and male-male competition, is a likely driver, but confirming this is difficult due to natural covariation among traits. The solution is to experimentally manipulate focal traits to identify targets of selection. Using 343 computer-generated male figures that varied in penis size, height and body shape, we experimentally tested how these traits influence perceived attractiveness and fighting ability. Over 800 participants—both male and female—viewed either life-sized (in-person) or scaled (online) animations and rated the figures. Across both settings, selection analyses revealed consistent directional selection favoring taller men with a more V-shaped body and a larger penis. In both surveys, male participants rated rivals with a larger penis as more sexually competitive and physically threatening. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size. Our findings suggest that female choice and male-male competition have jointly favored larger penis size, greater height, and more V-shaped bodies in men.

                <p>by Xiao Chen Shi, Rui Xin Zhang, Jun Kai Feng, Jia Hao Chen, Jian Feng Zhang, Jun Ying Xiao, Xiao Peng Liu, Huan Liu, Bo Xia, Li Nong Yao, Jiang Wei Wu</p>

Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that significantly affects patients’ quality of life and prognosis, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Optineurin (OPTN) as an active regulator for maintenance of muscle homeostasis during muscle atrophy. Knockdown (KD) of Optn induces muscle atrophy, while overexpression of Optn alleviated dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in mice. Mechanistically, we for the first time identified Junction plakoglobin (JUP) as a novel interacting partner of OPTN. OPTN alleviates muscle atrophy in a JUP-dependent manner, corroborating JUP as the downstream effector of OPTN-mediated muscle atrophy. RNA-seq analysis revealed that PI3K-AKT pathway is markedly downregulated in Optn-KD muscle, and pharmacological activation of PI3K-AKT pathway effectively rescued muscle atrophy in Optn-KD mice. We further show that OPTN coordinates the interaction between JUP and PI3-Kinase p85 in muscle, promoting activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Collectively, our study proposed a conceptual novelty that OPTN-JUP axis mediated activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway during muscle atrophy. These findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of muscle atrophy and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for this condition.

                Purpose This study aims to investigate the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with management accounting techniques and their impact on improving financial reporting, accountability, transparency, and the quality and efficiency of information. It also explores how this integration affects stakeholder trust in banks. Design/Methodology/Approach A structured questionnaire was used to survey 100 employees working in banks such Accountants, bankers, and specialized academics regarding AI and managerial accounting practices, and reporting quality. Quantitative models using structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to analyze the direct and indirect relationships between the variables. Results The results indicate that integrating AI technologies with management accounting does not necessarily lead to a direct increase in trust in banks. Rather, this is achieved through high-quality financial reporting, which acts as an intermediary between technological advancement and trust building. While banks strive to generate strong internal key performance indicators (KPIs) and functional accuracy, these should be disseminated clearly to gain the trust of customers and investors. Practical Implications The researchers’ findings, which focus on integrating artificial intelligence with management accounting, do not directly increase trust in banks. Rather, this effect is mediated by high-quality financial reporting. Therefore, it is essential for the studied government banks to focus on producing accurate and clear performance indicators and publishing them transparently to enhance their credibility and gain the trust of customers and investors. Originality/Value This study makes a pivotal contribution to academic literature and adds to the limited body of research on the integration of artificial intelligence, management accounting, financial reporting, and trust in banks.

                Background Rapid digital transformation and evolving organizational environments have increased the importance of understanding how workplace technologies and cultural conditions influence employee behavior and performance. Digital Employee Experience (DEX) and Organizational Culture are increasingly recognized as critical organizational resources that shape employees’ psychological states, particularly Employee Engagement, which subsequently drives individual performance. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding how these factors simultaneously interact within highly regulated and operationally complex industries such as aviation. Methods This study employed a quantitative explanatory design using data collected from 340 employees of PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) Tbk across five major directorates. A structured questionnaire measured DEX, Organizational Culture, Employee Engagement, and Employee Performance using validated reflective indicators. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test direct and mediating effects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity, meeting thresholds for outer loadings, composite reliability, AVE, and discriminant validity. Results The findings indicate that both Digital Employee Experience and Organizational Culture have significant positive effects on Employee Engagement and Employee Performance. Employee Engagement emerged as the strongest predictor of performance and served as a significant mediator linking DEX and Organizational Culture to performance outcomes. The structural model showed substantial explanatory power, indicating that organizational and digital resources influence performance largely through their effects on employee psychological engagement. Conclusions The study provides empirical support for the Job Demands–Resources framework by demonstrating that digital work environments and strong organizational cultures function as key job resources that enhance engagement and, in turn, improve performance. For organizations particularly in the aviation sector investing in high-quality digital systems, strengthening cultural alignment, and fostering employee engagement are essential strategies for sustaining performance in the face of digital transformation. Future research should incorporate longitudinal designs and multi-source data to further validate these findings.

                Recently, studies have focused on producing green, sustainable concrete with improved environmental performance, utilizing recycled waste materials. The early compressive strength of Green High Strength Concrete (GHSC) containing up to 60% ultrafine palm oil fuel ash (UPOFA) has been optimized utilizing hybrid materials, Silica Fume (SF), steel fiber (ST), and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) fiber. UPOFA was used as a substitute binder for cement in GHSC manufacture at 0%, 30%, and 60% replacement levels. SF was substituted for 0%, 10%, and 20% of the residual cement mass. Steel fiber and PET fiber were included at a rate of 1% of the total binder mass. The mix design parameters were optimized using the Response Surface Method (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) approach. The experimental results showed that the GHSC containing 30% UPOFA, 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fiber reached greater strength at 3, 7, and 28 days. The incorporation of 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fibers enhanced the early ages strength reduction of 60% UPOFA-GHSC by 17%, 25%, and 18% at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively, relative to the control mix. The constructed models showed significant correlation values (R2) of 0.9697, 0.9546, and 0.9674 for compressive strength at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively. Hence, RSM may be an efficient technique for improving mix design while lowering environmental impact by limiting waste volume and energy usage in cement manufacture, which contributes to the sustainability of concrete.

     alt="Innervation Drives Postembryonic Expansion of the Zebrafish Anterior Lateral Line System"/>
<p>A dramatic expansion of the anterior lateral line system occurs during zebrafish ontogeny, largely driven by the addition of superficial neuromasts. Here, we describe a new hybrid-origin mechanism of neuromast addition and uncover a larval-stage developmental switch to an innervation-dependent phase of expansion. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lateral line system is an essential sensory modality used by fishes and aquatic amphibians to sense hydrodynamic information. The system comprises distributed sense organs called neuromasts and their afferent nerves, organized into anterior lateral lines around the eye and jaw and posterior lateral lines (LL) on the trunk. At postembryonic stages, early forming neuromasts expand in size and sink into bony canals, while late-forming superficial neuromasts are added as the fish grows. Unlike the well-studied zebrafish posterior LL, details of anterior LL postembryonic development remain unknown. Here, we have characterized developmental mechanisms and innervation patterns driving expansion of the zebrafish anterior LL. Using tissue-clearing to observe neuromast and nerve markers through ontogeny, we demonstrate continuous neuromast addition in the anterior LL, with peak rates at larval stages of 7–10 mm standard length (SL). Lines of superficial neuromasts form parallel to existing lines of presumptive canal neuromasts as late as 7 mm SL, with new neuromasts added through migration of new primordia, budding, intercalation, and a novel “hybrid-origin” mechanism. Despite some canal lines being innervated by the anterodorsal ganglion, all superficial lines are innervated by the anteroventral ganglion. Anterior LL ganglion ablation reveals that denervation abrogates superficial neuromast formation—including via the hybrid-origin mechanism—and reduces growth of canal neuromasts. While the anterior and posterior LL use disparate developmental mechanisms, innervation is critical to the expansion of both. Our findings reveal a “developmental switch” at 7 mm SL, when innervation becomes necessary for a secondary phase of anterior LL development.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This paper describes the events leading up to the discovery of the place cells in 1971 for which the author received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2014, together with May-Britt and Edvard Moser. In addition, it explores some of the ideas and influences that contributed to the interpretation of that finding as evidence for the Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Crucial to the acceptance of the idea of place cells and cognitive maps has been the development of recording technologies, and some of these are covered in the middle section. The final section tries to draw some lessons that the author has reached from his experiences.</p>
