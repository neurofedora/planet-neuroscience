                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades most neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies and is associated with lower antibody titers upon breakthrough infections than previous variants. Tubiana et al. investigate the underlying mechanism using geometric deep learning, mice immunization experiments and biochemical assays. Mutations reduce antigenicity of the receptor binding site, leading to lower antibody response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Twist1 and balanced retinoic acid signaling act to suppress cortical folding in mice</a></h4>

              
                Evolution of cortical folding in gyrencephalic animals enabled higher cognitive functions and complex behaviors. Gene expression patterns and signaling molecules that control cortical folding have only recently been described and thus are still not well understood. In transgenic mouse models with induced cortical folding, amplification of neuroprogenitor cells or loss of their adhesion from the apical ventricular surface leads to gyri formation, whereas decreased cell adhesion in migrating projection neurons causes abnormal neuronal clustering and development of cortical fissures that resemble sulci. We now report that loss of Twist1 expression in the primitive meninx results in cortical folding and sulci formation in the dorsolateral telencephalon. In developing sulcal regions, generation of apical and basal neuroprogenitor cells is normal. Instead, cell proliferation in the developing meninges is reduced, leading to loss of arachnoid fibroblasts that express Raldh2, an enzyme required for retinoic acid synthesis. Maternal retinoic acid supplementation rescues cortical folding and sulci formation. Our results suggest that balanced retinoic acid signaling from the meninges is required to maintain lissencephaly in mice, and in a manner independent from neuroprogenitor cell amplification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Uniqueness of Human Vulnerability to Brain Aging in Great Ape Evolution</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with stable decline in the brains gray matter. This spatially specific, morphological change in humans has also recently been shown in chimpanzees. The correspondence between species-specific cortical expansion and the degree of brain structure deterioration in aging remains poorly understood. Here, we present a data-driven, cross-species comparative framework and apply it to explore the relationship between gray matter alterations with age and cross-species cerebral expansion in chimpanzees and humans. In humans, we found a positive relationship between cerebral aging and cortical expansion, whereas, in chimpanzees no such relationship was found between aging and cortical expansion. The greater aging and expansion effects in higher-order cognitive regions like the orbito-frontal cortex were observed to be unique to humans. This resembles the last-in, first out hypothesis for neurodevelopment on the evolutionary scale and may suggest a biological cost for recent evolutionary developments of human faculties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural timescales in the temporal lobe support an auditory processing hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                During rest, intrinsic neural dynamics manifest at multiple timescales, which progressively increase along visual and somatosensory hierarchies. Theoretically, intrinsic timescales are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli at multiple stages. However, direct links between timescales at rest and sensory processing, as well as translation to the auditory system are lacking. Here, we used intracranial electroencephalography in humans to show that in the auditory network, intrinsic neural timescales progressively increase, while the spectral slope flattens, from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Within the neocortex, intrinsic timescales exhibit spatial gradients that follow the temporal lobe anatomy. Crucially, intrinsic timescales at rest can explain the latency of auditory responses: as intrinsic timescales increase, so do the single-electrode response onset and peak latencies. Our results suggest that the human auditory network exhibits a repertoire of intrinsic neural dynamics, which manifest in cortical gradients with millimeter resolution and may provide a variety of temporal windows to support auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of compulsive coping behaviors depends on the engagement of dorsolateral striatum dopamine-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Humans greatly differ in how they cope with stress, a natural behaviour learnt through negative reinforcement. Some individuals engage in displacement activities, others in exercise or comfort eating, and others still in alcohol use. Across species, adjunctive behaviors, such as polydipsic drinking, are used as a form of displacement activity that reduce distress. Some individuals, in particular those that use alcohol to self-medicate, tend to lose control over such coping behaviors, which become excessive and compulsive. However, the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying this individual vulnerability have not been elucidated. Here we tested the hypothesis that the development of compulsive adjunctive behaviors stems from the functional engagement of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) dopamine-dependent habit system after a prolonged history of adjunctive responding. We measured in longitudinal studies in male Sprague Dawley rats the sensitivity of early established vs compulsive polydipsic water or alcohol drinking to a bilateral infusion of the dopamine receptor antagonist -flupentixol into the anterior DLS (aDLS). While most rats acquired a polydipsic drinking response with water, others only did so with alcohol. Whether reliant on water or alcohol, the acquisition of this coping response was insensitive to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade. In contrast, after prolonged experience, adjunctive drinking became dependent on the aDLS dopamine-dependent habit system at a time it was compulsive in vulnerable individuals. These data suggest that habits may develop out of negative reinforcement and that the engagement of their underlying striatal system is necessary for the manifestation of adjunctive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interneuron-targeted disruption of SYNGAP1 alters sensory representations in neocortex and impairs sensory learning</a></h4>

              
                SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans results in severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits. However, circuit mechanisms that underlie SYNGAP1-related neurodevelopmental disorders are poorly understood. A decrease of SynGAP in mice causes cognitive and behavioral deficits in part by disrupting the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Whether and to what extent SynGAP functions in inhibitory circuits remain unclear. We show that interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 heterozygous mice display learning deficits characterized by elevated behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to a sensory input unrelated to reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are associated with specific circuit abnormalities within primary somatosensory cortex, characterized by increased detrimental correlations and elevated responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli. Collectively, we show that a decrease of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons disrupts sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex, which likely contributes to behavioral deficits.

	<p>Dementia is a major health concern globally and cross-culturally with progressive decline in cognition, mobility and communication. There are few interventions for end-stage dementia (ESD) although music interventions have been observed to be accessible for people with mid to late-stage dementia. The lack of protocols and measures suited to ESD has limited research into the effects of music therapy. Measure sensitivity to minimal responsiveness is one limitation to the use of existing music intervention measures with ESD. This exploratory study examined the clinical utility of the Music Therapy Assessment Tool for Awareness in Disorders of Consciousness (MATADOC) for use with people with end-stage dementia, including preliminary reliability and validity. The MATADOC is a standardized assessment for minimally responsive patients with disorders of consciousness and may be useful for ESD. Using repeated measures with blinded MATADOC-trained raters, MATADOC data were collected with a small convenience sample of people with ESD in a residential care setting. Clinical utility data were collected from the raters and evaluated using a multidimensional model. To explore its functionality, MATADOC outcomes were compared to another measure for music interventions in dementia. The MATADOC may be useful for assessing functioning and responsiveness to music interventions for people with ESD without the risk of floor effects. Modifying the MATADOC protocol and assessment documentation prior to testing with a larger sample will enhance its sensitivity specific to ESD and age-related needs, providing a new music-based ESD assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Investigation of MicroRNA-134 as a Target against Seizures and SUDEP in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic form of pediatric epilepsy mainly caused by noninherited mutations in the <I>SCN1A</I> gene. DS patients suffer severe and life-threatening focal and generalized seizures which are often refractory to available anti-seizure medication. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) based approaches may offer treatment opportunities in DS. MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that play a key role in brain structure and function by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression, including ion channels. Inhibiting miRNA-134 (miR-134) using an antimiR ASO (Ant-134) has been shown to reduce evoked seizures in juvenile and adult mice and reduce epilepsy development in models of focal epilepsy. The present study investigated the levels of miR-134 and whether Ant-134 could protect against hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and mortality (SUDEP) in F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice. At P17, animals were intracerebroventricular injected with 0.1&ndash;1 nmol of Ant-134 and subject to a hyperthermia challenge at postnatal day (P)18. A second cohort of P21 F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice received Ant-134 and were followed by video and EEG monitoring until P28 to track the incidence of spontaneous seizures and SUDEP. Hippocampal and cortical levels of miR-134 were similar between wild-type (WT) and F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice. Moreover, Ant-134 had no effect on hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and SUDEP incidence were unchanged in Ant-134-treated DS mice. These findings suggest that targeting miR-134 does not have therapeutic applications in DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of common mental health problems and associated factors among university students visiting Supara mental health service: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems.   Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Design And Development of a Remote Monitoring Agent For Energy Service Companies In The Telecommunication Industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) for telecommunication sites operate by providing reliable power supply at 100% uptime and billing the mobile operators accommodated on their sites for power usage. To achieve this, there is a need for them to accurately meter the power consumed by connected telecommunication equipment. Method: This work focused on the design and implementation of a remote monitoring agent (RMA) that will pool both power and environmental data from a telecommunication site. The data pool can be presented as real-time data on the RMA’s webpage, it can be downloaded as historical data, and it can be sent to a remote cloud server at regular intervals. The RMA collects both power and environmental data over an RS485 Modbus network and I2C bus respectively. An alternating current (AC) energy meter and a direct current (DC) energy meter were used to harvest the energy data while the environmental data were harvested using a developed Input/Output controller board based on an Atmega328P microcontroller. Raspberry pi was used as the master controller and Node.js was used to build the application running on the master controller.  Result: The result showed how both power and environmental data can be harvested from a telecommunication site and locally presented on the web dashboard for real-time monitoring of the site power system. The data could be saved locally on the RMA and downloaded for future use. Conclusion: The implementation of this work provided a prototype of the remote monitoring agent (RMA) that can be deployed by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in the telecommunication industry to monitor the usage of the power systems on a cell site.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Primary graft failure due to a reversed lenticule in Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction and importance: This report details the clinical features and management in a case of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) which had primary graft failure (PGF) due to an inverted yet attached lenticule. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old gentleman had poor visual recovery in the right eye after undergoing cataract surgery 12 years prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers and examination revealed endothelial decompensation. The patient underwent a DSAEK and postoperatively had a well attached lenticule. However, the cornea was edematous three weeks after the surgery and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a reversed lenticule. The patient underwent a repeat DSAEK and had an uneventful postoperative course. The visual acuity was 20/40 after 7 months with a clear cornea and a well attached graft. Discussion: PGF is a rare complication following DSAEK which occurs due to poor endothelial function of the donor graft. Insertion of a reversed lenticule may get overlooked as a cause of PGF unless the graft edge profile is examined on an OCT scan. The graft in the current case was well attached despite its inverted position suggesting that graft adherence is perhaps not a function of the corneal endothelial pumps in isolation and may be driven by factors such as the intraocular pressure. Conclusion: A reversed DSAEK lenticule may have normal adherence to the host stroma and must be considered in cases with PGF. OCT of the graft edge is required for diagnosis before performing a repeat keratoplasty.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors predicting complications, neurologic deterioration and mortality for patients with meningioma surgery: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Meningiomas are the second most common intracranial neoplasm, contributing to 30% of all intracranial tumors. Clinical examination, anatomical pathology testing, CT, and MRI are required to confirm the meningioma diagnosis. Surgery is the therapy of choice for meningiomas. Understanding factors affecting the outcome of meningioma surgery is critical to predicting the outcome of meningioma surgery. Methods: A retrospective analytic method was conducted in this study, which included meningioma patients who underwent surgery at Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital between January 2014 and December 2020. The study incorporated secondary data in the form of medical records. Data collection was followed by binomial logistic regression analysis using SPSS IBM 25. Results:  A total of 440 samples of patients with meningiomas were obtained through medical records. Post-operative hematoma (2.5%), postoperative infection (3.0%), neurologic deterioration (3.9%), and 30-day mortality (2.3%) were the postoperative complications reported. Emergency surgery was found to be a significant predictor of postoperative hematoma (p=0.025; OR=4.539; 95% CI: 1.211-17.006), postoperative infection (p=0.015; OR=4.777; 95% CI: 1.362-16.751), neurologic deterioration (p=0.022; OR=5,151; 95% CI: 1,271-20,882), and 30-day mortality (p=0.002; OR=17,874; 95% CI: 2,933-108,915). Simpson Grade IV (p=0.016; OR=33,524; 95% CI: 1.905-590.056) was a significant predictive factor for postoperative hematomas. Post-operative hematoma was a significant predictive factor for neurologic deterioration (p=0.000; OR=235,807; 95% CI: 38,058-1461,069) and 30-day mortality (p=0.001; OR=40,047; 95% CI: 4,985-321,699). Conclusions: Post-operative complications following meningioma surgery may result in high morbidity and mortality. The predictive factors for meningioma surgery complications were identified in this study. Knowledge of these factors may aid in preventing or predicting meningioma surgery complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing laboratory-based surveillance networks for monitoring multi-genotype or multi-serotype infections</a></h4>

With the aid of laboratory typing techniques, infectious disease surveillance networks have the opportunity to obtain powerful information on the emergence, circulation, and evolution of multiple genotypes, serotypes or other subtypes of pathogens, informing understanding of transmission dynamics and strategies for prevention and control. The volume of typing performed on clinical isolates is typically limited by its ability to inform clinical care, cost and logistical constraints, especially in comparison with the capacity to monitor clinical reports of disease occurrence, which remains the most widespread form of public health surveillance. Viewing clinical disease reports as arising from a latent mixture of pathogen subtypes, laboratory typing of a subset of clinical cases can provide inference on the proportion of clinical cases attributable to each subtype (i.e., the mixture components). Optimizing protocols for the selection of isolates for typing by weighting specific subpopulations, locations, time periods, or case characteristics (e.g., disease severity), may improve inference of the frequency and distribution of pathogen subtypes within and between populations. Here, we apply the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework to simulate and optimize hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) surveillance in a high-burden region of western China. We identify laboratory surveillance designs that significantly outperform the existing network: the optimal network reduced mean absolute error in estimated serotype-specific incidence rates by 14.1%; similarly, the optimal network for monitoring <i>severe</i> cases reduced mean absolute error in serotype-specific incidence rates by 13.3%. In both cases, the optimal network designs achieved improved inference without increasing subtyping effort. We demonstrate how the DIOS framework can be used to optimize surveillance networks by augmenting clinical diagnostic data with limited laboratory typing resources, while adapting to specific, local surveillance objectives and constraints.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pruning deep neural networks generates a sparse, bio-inspired nonlinear controller for insect flight</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivia Zahn, Jorge Bustamante Jr., Callin Switzer, Thomas L. Daniel, J. Nathan Kutz</p>

Insect flight is a strongly nonlinear and actuated dynamical system. As such, strategies for understanding its control have typically relied on either model-based methods or linearizations thereof. Here we develop a framework that combines model predictive control on an established flight dynamics model and <i>deep neural networks</i> (DNN) to create an efficient method for solving the inverse problem of flight control. We turn to natural systems for inspiration since they inherently demonstrate network pruning with the consequence of yielding more efficient networks for a specific set of tasks. This bio-inspired approach allows us to leverage network pruning to optimally sparsify a DNN architecture in order to perform flight tasks with as few neural connections as possible, however, there are limits to sparsification. Specifically, as the number of connections falls below a critical threshold, flight performance drops considerably. We develop sparsification paradigms and explore their limits for control tasks. Monte Carlo simulations also quantify the statistical distribution of network weights during pruning given initial random weights of the DNNs. We demonstrate that on average, the network can be pruned to retain a small amount of original network weights and still perform comparably to its fully-connected counterpart. The relative number of remaining weights, however, is highly dependent on the initial architecture and size of the network. Overall, this work shows that sparsely connected DNNs are capable of predicting the forces required to follow flight trajectories. Additionally, sparsification has sharp performance limits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Leaf vein patterning is regulated by the aperture of plasmodesmata intercellular channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nguyen Manh Linh, Enrico Scarpella</p>

To form tissue networks, animal cells migrate and interact through proteins protruding from their plasma membranes. Plant cells can do neither, yet plants form vein networks. How plants do so is unclear, but veins are thought to form by the coordinated action of the polar transport and signal transduction of the plant hormone auxin. However, plants inhibited in both pathways still form veins. Patterning of vascular cells into veins is instead prevented in mutants lacking the function of the <i>GNOM</i> (<i>GN</i>) regulator of auxin transport and signaling, suggesting the existence of at least one more <i>GN</i>-dependent vein-patterning pathway. Here we show that in Arabidopsis such a pathway depends on the movement of auxin or an auxin-dependent signal through plasmodesmata (PDs) intercellular channels. PD permeability is high where veins are forming, lowers between veins and nonvascular tissues, but remains high between vein cells. Impaired ability to regulate PD aperture leads to defects in auxin transport and signaling, ultimately leading to vein patterning defects that are enhanced by inhibition of auxin transport or signaling. <i>GN</i> controls PD aperture regulation, and simultaneous inhibition of auxin signaling, auxin transport, and regulated PD aperture phenocopies null <i>gn</i> mutants. Therefore, veins are patterned by the coordinated action of three <i>GN</i>-dependent pathways: auxin signaling, polar auxin transport, and movement of auxin or an auxin-dependent signal through PDs. Such a mechanism of tissue network formation is unprecedented in multicellular organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vaccine Hesitancy in Japan: From a Perspective on Medical Uncertainty and Trans-Scientific Theory [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The development and dissemination of vaccines has made immunization possible and has led to the successful control and eradication of various infectious diseases in many parts of the world. However, even when vaccines that are said to be "effective" are offered, a certain number of people do not receive them, and this has become a problem known as "vaccine hesitancy”. Why is vaccine hesitancy a problem? It has been pointed out that the reason is not only because of the risk of contracting infectious diseases if they are not vaccinated, but also because of the lack of a collective immunity system. Vaccines are an effective means of acquiring immunity, but no matter how highly effective vaccines are developed, if the vaccination rate does not exceed a certain number, herd immunity cannot be acquired. Therefore, it is said that how to increase the vaccination rate of the population is a major public health challenge. Hence, the large number of people who do not receive vaccinations due to "vaccine hesitancy" is problematic. This paper reviews previous studies on "vaccine hesitancy" in Japan and analyzes people's hesitancy in terms of negative "rumors" about vaccines, risk perception of vaccine side effects, and sense of burden when receiving vaccinations. Then, I will examine that the background of "vaccine hesitancy" is not only distrust of vaccines and risk perception of side effects, but also distrust of those who provide and promote vaccinations, such as medical professionals, government, and public administration. By using medical uncertainty and trans-scientific theory, this paper argues that the problem of "vaccine hesitancy" can be reduced if medical professionals and governments show sincere empathy and attitude toward victims of adverse vaccine reactions and those who hesitate to vaccinate.

                Depigmentation of hair shafts is a hallmark of human aging. However, it remains unclear how aging causes human hair to grey. Here, we found that a single session of hair plucking via waxing causes hair to grey in castrated mice. Moreover, this hair greying continued for several hair cycles. Given that androgen secretion decreases with age in both male and female humans, the present result suggests that this decrease may contribute to age-related hair greying. In addition, our experimental procedure may represent an effective way to generate a new mouse model of hair greying without the need for genetic engineering.

                Background Long-term chemical drug consumption to treat hypertension may have side effects because the levels are sometimes difficult for the body to tolerate. Therefore, some people have used plants as herbal medicine, including avocado leaves (Persea americana Mill.) as antihypertensive. This study aims to find out the differences in the effectiveness of modern drugs and natural antihypertensive ingredients in avocado leaf extract (containing flavonoids and quercetin compounds) in inhibiting the ACE enzyme, which causes decreasing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as well as increasing urine volume. Methods This study used an experimental in vivo study design involving 24 white male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus), aged 2–3 months, weighing 130–250 g, and of a healthy condition with active movement. The samples were randomly divided into six treatment groups and post-test only research design with control group design. Results The result of the study showed that avocado leaf extract was effective in reducing blood pressure in Wistar rats with hypertension induced by 16% NaCl for 14 days. SBP fell from 164.92 mmHg to 116.83 mmHg and DBP from 118.42 mmHg to 82.83 mmHg. One-way ANOVA test value significance SBP p=0.000 and Kruskal–Wallis test value of DBP p=0.030, Kruskal–Wallis test urine volume value of p=0.002. The statistical test results proved that avocado leaf extract significantly reduced the blood pressure and increased the urine volume in hypertensive rats. The ACE inhibitor test, performed using an ELISA, showed that the extract inhibition against the ACE enzyme was 60.0±12.1%, serum nitrate levels 41.1±11.5. The decrease in blood pressure occurred because the extract contained a quercetin compound discovered by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method of 1129.597 ppm. Conclusions The study showed that the leaf extract of Persea americana Mill. was effective as an antihypertensive.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Recent advancements in machine vision methods for product code recognition: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Manufacturing markings printed on products play an important role in the handling and use of pharmaceuticals and perishable foods. Currently, optical character recognition, neural networks, deep learning-based methods, and combinations of these methods are used to recognize these codes. Methods: This systematic review was performed to find papers that can answer the following research questions: How have machine vision methods that can recognize product texts evolved over the past eight years? What are the most common difficulties in recognizing product texts? Articles published between 2012 and 2020 were systematically searched from Science Direct/SCOPUS, and Google Scholar in November-December 2020. Ten studies were eligible, with inclusion criteria: details about the recognition method used, performance analysis result, imaging method, product and the text printed on it. Results: Product text recognition methods have evolved significantly over the last two years to tolerate the most common difficulties in the field. This is due to the ability of the deep learning neural network (DNN) architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract and learn salient character features straight from packaging surface images. Four of the most recent methods use two consecutive deep learning networks, one detecting the text area based on an image captured from the product package's surface and the other recognizing the characters within. Furthermore, this paper presents solutions to the most common product text recognition difficulties. Conclusions: There were a limited number of studies that met the eligibility criteria for this systematic review. The study's aim was to evaluate the development of machine vision methods for recognizing manufacturing marking texts printed on the surface of products. The study results demonstrated how methods have evolved over time, beginning with optical character recognition, and advancing to methods which can recognize texts despite the field's most common problems.

                Background: Both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to joint health and disease. For example, pathological levels of biomechanical stress on joints play a notable role in initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), a common chronic degenerative joint disease affecting articular cartilage and underlying bone. Population-level gene expression studies of cartilage cells experiencing biomechanical stress may uncover gene-by-environment interactions relevant to human joint health. Methods: To build a foundation for population-level gene expression studies in cartilage, we applied differentiation protocols to develop an in vitro system of chondrogenic cell lines (iPSC-chondrocytes). We characterized gene regulatory responses of three human iPSC-chondrocyte lines to cyclic tensile strain treatment. We measured the contribution of biological and technical factors to gene expression variation in this system. Results: We identified patterns of gene regulation that differ between strain-treated and control iPSC-chondrocytes. Differentially expressed genes between strain and control conditions are enriched for gene sets relevant to joint health and OA. Furthermore, even in this small sample, we found several genes that exhibit inter-individual expression differences in response to mechanical strain, including genes previously implicated in OA. Conclusions: Expanding this system to include iPSC-chondrocytes from a larger number of individuals will allow us to characterize and better understand gene-by-environment interactions related to joint health.

                Background: In this study, we examined the volatility of the Indian stock market from 2008 to 2021. Owing to the financial crisis, volatility forecasting of the Indian stock market has become crucial for economic and financial analysts. An empirical study of the returns of the NSE indices revealed an autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic trend in the Indian stock market. Methods: Using GARCH 1, 1 (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) and FIGARCH (fractionally integrated GARCH), we examine investor behaviour and the persistence of long-term volatility. Results: The empirical findings of the estimated models suggest that shocks persist for a long time in NSE returns. Furthermore, bad news has a greater impact on stock volatility than good news. The return on assets is stable but highly volatile, even though the Indian economy has experienced the global crash to some extent. Conclusions: Models of volatility derived from the GARCH equation provide accurate forecasts and are useful for portfolio allocation, performance measurement, and option valuation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), diagnosed at a mean age of 32 years. CNS glia are crucial players in the onset of MS, primarily involving astrocytes and microglia that can cause/allow massive oligodendroglial cells death, without immune cell infiltration. Current therapeutic approaches are aimed at modulating inflammatory reactions during relapsing episodes, but lack the ability to induce very significant repair mechanisms. In this review article, different experimental approaches based mainly on the application of different cell types as therapeutic strategies applied for the induction of myelin repair and/or the amelioration of the disease are discussed. Regarding this issue, different cell sources were applied in various experimental models of MS, with different results, both in significant improvements in remyelination and the reduction of neuroinflammation and glial activation, or in neuroprotection. All cell types tested have advantages and disadvantages, which makes it difficult to choose a better option for therapeutic application in MS. New strategies combining cell-based treatment with other applications would result in further improvements and would be good candidates for MS cell therapy and myelin repair.</p>

Unexpectedly, the cytoskeleton organizers UNC-119, UNC-44, and UNC-33, which are ngn-1/Ngn targets, promote motoneuron terminal identity.

                Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes is essential in the mammalian central nervous system. Using conditional mutant mice, DeGeer et al. show that Ral GTPases in spinal cord oligodendroglia are crucial regulators of myelination during development and contribute to the protection of the healthy state of myelin-axon units in the adult.

                TOP1 deficiency increases R loops driving replication stress characterized by slow replication and DNA damage. Sarni et al. reveal that HRAS increases TOP1 and reduces R loops, causing accelerated replication and DNA damage, highlighting the importance of TOP1 equilibrium in regulating R-loop homeostasis to ensure faithful replication and genome integrity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Essential role for epithelial HIF-mediated xenophagy in control of Salmonella infection and dissemination</a></h4>

              
                Dowdell et al. show that hypoxia, through stabilization of HIF-1α, activates autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Further, the model invasive bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium stabilizes HIF in IECs to trigger anti-bacterial autophagy (xenophagy). This mechanism demonstrates an essential mucosal innate immune response for control of invasive pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Continuous double-strand break induction and their differential processing sustain chiasma formation during Caenorhabditis elegans meiosis</a></h4>

              
                Meiotic chromosome segregation requires Spo11-mediated break induction and long end resection to form crossovers. Hicks et al. show that break formation occurs throughout pachytene stage in C. elegans, and those formed later are essential to generate crossovers. DNA-2/EXO-1 activity mainly on later breaks ensures homologous recombination-dependent repair, preventing non-homologous end joining.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Distinct mechanisms of planar polarization by the core and Fat-Dachsous planar polarity pathways in the Drosophila wing</a></h4>

              
                Brittle et al. investigate how two different pathways generate planar polarity. Behavior of the Frizzled-dependent “core” pathway suggests the ability to self-organize planar polarity that can be oriented by weak tissue-level direction cues. Conversely, the Fat-Dachsous pathway shows only weak self-organizing properties and dependence on strong tissue-level gradient cues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative MRI reveals differences in striatal myelin in children with DLD</a></h4>

              
                Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by receptive or expressive language difficulties or both. While theoretical frameworks and empirical studies support the idea that there may be neural correlates of DLD in frontostriatal loops, findings are inconsistent across studies. Here, we use a novel semiquantitative imaging protocol – multi-parameter mapping (MPM) – to investigate microstructural neural differences in children with DLD. The MPM protocol allows us to reproducibly map specific indices of tissue microstructure. In 56 typically developing children and 33 children with DLD, we derived maps of (1) longitudinal relaxation rate R1 (1/T1), (2) transverse relaxation rate R2* (1/T2*), and (3) Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat). R1 and MTsat predominantly index myelin, while R2* is sensitive to iron content. Children with DLD showed reductions in MTsat values in the caudate nucleus bilaterally, as well as in the left ventral sensorimotor cortex and Heschl’s gyrus. They also had globally lower R1 values. No group differences were noted in R2* maps. Differences in MTsat and R1 were coincident in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. These findings support our hypothesis of corticostriatal abnormalities in DLD and indicate abnormal levels of myelin in the dorsal striatum in children with DLD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bumblebees retrieve only the ordinal ranking of foraging options when comparing memories obtained in distinct settings</a></h4>

              
                Are animals’ preferences determined by absolute memories for options (e.g. reward sizes) or by their remembered ranking (better/worse)? The only studies examining this question suggest humans and starlings utilise memories for both absolute and relative information. We show that bumblebees’ learned preferences are based only on memories of ordinal comparisons. A series of experiments showed that after learning to discriminate pairs of different flowers by sucrose concentration, bumblebees preferred flowers (in novel pairings) with (1) higher ranking over equal absolute reward, (2) higher ranking over higher absolute reward, and (3) identical qualitative ranking but different quantitative ranking equally. Bumblebees used absolute information in order to rank different flowers. However, additional experiments revealed that, even when ranking information was absent (i.e. bees learned one flower at a time), memories for absolute information were lost or could no longer be retrieved after at most 1 hr. Our results illuminate a divergent mechanism for bees (compared to starlings and humans) of learned preferences that may have arisen from different adaptations to their natural environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Loss of full-length dystrophin expression results in major cell-autonomous abnormalities in proliferating myoblasts</a></h4>

              
                Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects myofibers and muscle stem cells, causing progressive muscle degeneration and repair defects. It was unknown whether dystrophic myoblasts—the effector cells of muscle growth and regeneration—are affected. Using transcriptomic, genome-scale metabolic modelling and functional analyses, we demonstrate, for the first time, convergent abnormalities in primary mouse and human dystrophic myoblasts. In <i>Dmd</i><sup>mdx</sup> myoblasts lacking full-length dystrophin, the expression of 170 genes was significantly altered. <i>Myod1</i> and key genes controlled by MyoD (<i>Myog, Mymk, Mymx</i>, epigenetic regulators, ECM interactors, calcium signalling and fibrosis genes) were significantly downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment in genes involved in muscle development and function. Functionally, we found increased myoblast proliferation, reduced chemotaxis and accelerated differentiation, which are all essential for myoregeneration. The defects were caused by the loss of expression of full-length dystrophin, as similar and not exacerbated alterations were observed in dystrophin-null <i>Dmd</i><sup>mdx-βgeo</sup> myoblasts. Corresponding abnormalities were identified in human DMD primary myoblasts and a dystrophic mouse muscle cell line, confirming the cross-species and cell-autonomous nature of these defects. The genome-scale metabolic analysis in human DMD myoblasts showed alterations in the rate of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, leukotriene metabolism, and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of various fatty acids. These results reveal the disease continuum: DMD defects in satellite cells, the myoblast dysfunction affecting muscle regeneration, which is insufficient to counteract muscle loss due to myofiber instability. Contrary to the established belief, our data demonstrate that DMD abnormalities occur in myoblasts, making these cells a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of this lethal disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Species clustering, climate effects, and introduced species in 5 million city trees across 63 US cities</a></h4>

              
                Sustainable cities depend on urban forests. City trees-pillars of urban forests - improve our health, clean the air, store CO<sub>2</sub>, and cool local temperatures. Comparatively less is known about city tree communities as ecosystems, particularly regarding spatial composition, species diversity, tree health, and the abundance of introduced species. Here, we assembled and standardized a new dataset of N=5,660,237 trees from 63 of the largest US cities with detailed information on location, health, species, and whether a species is introduced or naturally occurring (i.e., 'native'). We further designed new tools to analyze spatial clustering and the abundance of introduced species. We show that trees significantly cluster by species in 98% of cities, potentially increasing pest vulnerability (even in species-diverse cities). Further, introduced species significantly homogenize tree communities across cities, while naturally occurring trees (i.e., 'native' trees) comprise 0.51%-87.3% (median=45.6%) of city tree populations. Introduced species are more common in drier cities, and climate also shapes tree species diversity across urban forests. Parks have greater tree species diversity than urban settings. Compared to past work which focused on canopy cover and species richness, we show the importance of analyzing spatial composition and introduced species in urban ecosystems (and we develop new tools and datasets to do so). Future work could analyze city trees and socio-demographic variables or bird, insect, and plant diversity (e.g., from citizen-science initiatives). With these tools, we may evaluate existing city trees in new, nuanced ways and design future plantings to maximize resistance to pests and climate change. We depend on city trees.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncertainty-based inference of a common cause for body ownership</a></h4>

              
                Many studies have investigated the contributions of vision, touch, and proprioception to body ownership, i.e., the multisensory perception of limbs and body parts as our own. However, the computational processes and principles that determine subjectively experienced body ownership remain unclear. To address this issue, we developed a detection-like psychophysics task based on the classic rubber hand illusion paradigm where participants were asked to report whether the rubber hand felt like their own (the illusion) or not. We manipulated the asynchrony of visual and tactile stimuli delivered to the rubber hand and the hidden real hand under different levels of visual noise. We found that (1) the probability of the emergence of the rubber hand illusion increased with visual noise and was well predicted by a causal inference model involving the observer computing the probability of the visual and tactile signals coming from a common source; (2) the causal inference model outperformed a non-Bayesian model involving the observer not taking into account sensory uncertainty; (3) by comparing body ownership and visuotactile synchrony detection, we found that the prior probability of inferring a common cause for the two types of multisensory percept was correlated but greater for ownership, which suggests that individual differences in rubber hand illusion can be explained at the computational level as differences in how priors are used in the multisensory integration process. These results imply that the same statistical principles determine the perception of the bodily self and the external world.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integration of mouse ovary morphogenesis with developmental dynamics of the oviduct, ovarian ligaments, and rete ovarii</a></h4>

              
                Morphogenetic events during development of the fetal ovary are crucial to the establishment of female fertility. However, the effects of structural rearrangements of the ovary and surrounding reproductive tissues on ovary morphogenesis remain largely uncharacterized. Using tissue clearing and lightsheet microscopy, we found that ovary folding correlated with regionalization into cortex and medulla. Relocation of the oviduct to the ventral aspect of the ovary led to ovary encapsulation, and mutual attachment of the ovary and oviduct to the cranial suspensory ligament likely triggered ovary folding. During this process, the rete ovarii elaborated into a convoluted tubular structure extending from the ovary into the ovarian capsule. Using genetic mouse models in which the oviduct and rete ovarii are perturbed, we found the oviduct is required for ovary encapsulation. This study reveals novel relationships among the ovary and surrounding tissues and paves the way for functional investigation of the relationship between architecture and differentiation of the mammalian ovary.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Resurrecting essential amino acid biosynthesis in mammalian cells</a></h4>

              
                Major genomic deletions in independent eukaryotic lineages have led to repeated ancestral loss of biosynthesis pathways for nine of the twenty canonical amino acids<sup>1</sup>. While the evolutionary forces driving these polyphyletic deletion events are not well understood, the consequence is that extant metazoans are unable to produce nine essential amino acids (EAAs). Previous studies have highlighted that EAA biosynthesis tends to be more energetically costly<sup>2,3</sup>, raising the possibility that these pathways were lost from organisms with access to abundant EAAs in the environment<sup>4,5</sup>. It is unclear whether present-day metazoans can reaccept these pathways to resurrect biosynthetic capabilities that were lost long ago or whether evolution has rendered EAA pathways incompatible with metazoan metabolism. Here, we report progress on a large-scale synthetic genomics effort to reestablish EAA biosynthetic functionality in mammalian cells. We designed codon-optimized biosynthesis pathways based on genes mined from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These pathways were <i>de novo</i> synthesized in 3 kilobase chunks, assembled <i>in yeasto</i> and genomically integrated into a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. One synthetic pathway produced valine at a sufficient level for cell viability and proliferation, and thus represents a successful example of metazoan EAA biosynthesis restoration. This prototrophic CHO line grows in valine-free medium, and metabolomics using labeled precursors verified <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of valine. RNA-seq profiling of the valine prototrophic CHO line showed that the synthetic pathway minimally disrupted the cellular transcriptome. Furthermore, valine prototrophic cells exhibited transcriptional signatures associated with rescue from nutritional starvation. <sup>13</sup>C-tracing revealed build-up of pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxy-3-isovalerate in these cells. Increasing the dosage of downstream <i>ilvD</i> boosted pathway performance and allowed for long-term propagation of second-generation cells in valine-free medium at a consistent doubling time of 3.2 days. This work demonstrates that mammalian metabolism is amenable to restoration of ancient core pathways, paving a path for genome-scale efforts to synthetically restore metabolic functions to the metazoan lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mixed synapses reconcile violations of the size principle in zebrafish spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Mixed electrical-chemical synapses potentially complicate electrophysiological interpretations of neuronal excitability and connectivity. Here, we disentangle the impact of mixed synapses within the spinal locomotor circuitry of larval zebrafish. We demonstrate that soma size is not linked to input resistance for interneurons, contrary to the biophysical predictions of the ‘size principle’ for motor neurons. Next, we show that time constants are faster, excitatory currents stronger, and mixed potentials larger in lower resistance neurons, linking mixed synapse density to resting excitability. Using a computational model, we verify the impact of weighted electrical synapses on membrane properties, synaptic integration and the low-pass filtering and distribution of coupling potentials. We conclude differences in mixed synapse density can contribute to excitability underestimations and connectivity overestimations. The contribution of mixed synaptic inputs to resting excitability helps explain ‘violations’ of the size principle, where neuron size, resistance and recruitment order are unrelated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conduction velocity along a key white matter tract is associated with autobiographical memory recall ability</a></h4>

              
                Conduction velocity is the speed at which electrical signals travel along axons and is a crucial determinant of neural communication. Inferences about conduction velocity can now be made in vivo in humans using a measure called the magnetic resonance (MR) g-ratio. This is the ratio of the inner axon diameter relative to that of the axon plus the myelin sheath that encases it. Here, in the first application to cognition, we found that variations in MR g-ratio, and by inference conduction velocity, of the parahippocampal cingulum bundle were associated with autobiographical memory recall ability in 217 healthy adults. This tract connects the hippocampus with a range of other brain areas. We further observed that the association seemed to be with inner axon diameter rather than myelin content. The extent to which neurites were coherently organised within the parahippocampal cingulum bundle was also linked with autobiographical memory recall ability. Moreover, these findings were specific to autobiographical memory recall and were not apparent for laboratory-based memory tests. Our results offer a new perspective on individual differences in autobiographical memory recall ability, highlighting the possible influence of specific white matter microstructure features on conduction velocity when recalling detailed memories of real-life past experiences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Trends in female-selective abortion among Asian diasporas in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia</a></h4>

              
                Preference for sons and smaller families and, in the case of China, a one-child policy, have contributed to missing girl births in India and China over the last few decades due to sex-selective abortions. Selective abortion occurs also among Indian and Chinese diaspora, but their variability and trends over time are unknown. We examined conditional sex ratio (CSR) of girl births per 1000 boy births among second or third births following earlier daughters or sons in India, China, and their diaspora in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom (UK), and United States (US) drawing upon 18.4 million birth records from census and nationally representative surveys from 1999 to 2019. Among Indian women, the CSR in 2016 for second births following a first daughter favoured boys in India (866), similar to those in diaspora in Australia (888) and Canada (882). For third births following two earlier daughters in 2016, CSRs favoured sons in Canada (520) and Australia (653) even more than in India (769). Among women in China outside the one-child restriction, CSRs in 2015 for second order births somewhat favoured more girls after a first son (1154) but more heavily favoured boys after a first daughter (561). Third-birth CSRs generally fell over time among diaspora, except among Chinese diaspora in the UK and US. In the UK, third-birth CSRs fell among Indian but not among other South Asian diasporas. Selective abortion of girls is notable among Indian diaspora, particularly at higher-order births.

                Shared lineage has diverse effects on patterns of neuronal connectivity. In mammalian cortex, excitatory sister neurons assemble into shared microcircuits, whereas throughout the Drosophila nervous system, Notch-differentiated sister neurons diverge into distinct circuits. Notch-differentiated sister neurons have been observed in vertebrate spinal cord and cerebellum, but whether they integrate into shared or distinct circuits remains unknown. Here we evaluate the connectivity between sister V2a/b neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord. Using an in vivo labeling approach, we identified pairs of sister V2a/b neurons born from individual Vsx1+ progenitors and observed that they have similar axonal trajectories and proximal somata. However, paired whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics revealed that sister V2a/b neurons receive input from distinct presynaptic sources, do not communicate with each other, and connect to largely distinct targets. These results resemble the divergent connectivity in Drosophila and represent the first evidence of Notch-differentiated circuit integration in a vertebrate system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitf is a Schwann Cell Sensor of Axonal Integrity that Drives Nerve Repair</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells respond to acute axon damage by transiently transdifferentiating into specialized repair cells that restore sensorimotor function. However, the molecular systems controlling repair cell formation and function are not well defined and consequently it is unclear whether this form of cellular plasticity has a role in peripheral neuropathies. Here we identify Mitf as a transcriptional sensor of axon damage under the control of Nrg-ErbB-PI3K-PI5K-mTorc2 signaling. Mitf regulates a core transcriptional program for generating functional repair Schwann cells following injury and during peripheral neuropathies caused by CMT4J and CMT4D. In the absence of Mitf, core genes for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, metabolism and dedifferentiation are misexpressed and nerve repair is disrupted. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Schwann cells monitor axonal health using a phosphoinositide signaling system that controls Mitf, which is critical for activating cellular plasticity and counteracting neural disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human-like Modulation SensitivityEmerging through Optimization to Natural Sound Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Natural sounds contain rich patterns of amplitude modulation (AM), which is one of the essential sound dimensions for hearing perception. The sensitivity of human hearing to AM measured by psychophysics takes diverse forms, from low-pass to high-pass, depending on the experimental conditions. Here, we address with a single framework the questions of why such patterns of AM sensitivity have emerged in the human auditory system and how they are realized by our neural mechanisms. Assuming that optimization for natural sound recognition has taken place during human evolution and development, we examined its effect on the formation of AM sensitivity by optimizing a computational model, specifically, a multi-layer (or deep) neural network, for natural sound recognition and simulating psychophysical experiments in which the model's AM sensitivity was measured. Relatively higher layers in the optimized model exhibited qualitatively and quantitatively similar AM sensitivity to that of humans, even though the model was not designed to reproduce human-like AM sensitivity. The similarity of the model's AM sensitivity to humans' correlated with its sound recognition accuracy. Optimization of the model to degraded sounds revealed the necessity of natural AM patterns for the emergence of human-like AM sensitivity. Consistent results were observed from optimizations to two different types of natural sound. Moreover, simulated neurophysiological experiments on the same model revealed a correspondence between the model layers and the auditory brain regions that is based on the similarity of their neural AM tunings. The layers in which human-like psychophysical AM sensitivity emerged exhibited substantial neurophysiological similarity with the auditory midbrain and higher regions. These results suggest that the behavioral AM sensitivity of human hearing has emerged as a result of optimization for natural-sound recognition in the course of our evolution and/or development and that it is based on a stimulus representation encoded in the neural firing rates in the auditory midbrain and higher regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampo-cortical circuits for selective memory encoding, routing, and replay</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally considered a homogeneous cell type, hippocampal pyramidal cells have been recently shown to be highly diverse. However, how this cellular diversity relates to the different hippocampal network computations that support memory-guided behavior is not yet known. We discovered that the anatomical identity of pyramidal cells is a major organizing principle of CA1 assembly dynamics, the emergence of memory replay, and cortical projection patterns. Segregated pyramidal cell subpopulations encoded trajectory and choice-specific information or tracked changes in reward configuration respectively, and selectively routed these representations to different cortical targets. Furthermore, distinct hippocampo-cortical assemblies coordinated the reactivation of complementary memory representations. These findings reveal the existence of specialized hippocampo-cortical subcircuits and provide a cellular mechanism that supports the computational flexibility and memory capacities of these structures.

                While humans have a remarkable ability to read and comprehend text, the neuronal mechanisms supporting natural reading remain elusive. It is debated whether upcoming words in the parafovea are processed semantically. Here we show that the brain can indeed detect that a word is contextually implausible even before fixating on it. We demonstrated this by imperceivably flickering target words at 60 Hz that either were congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. While participants read these sentences, we used MEG to detect the flicker-response prior to saccades to the target words. We found a smaller tagging response for words that were incongruent with the sentence context; this reduction was related to the individual reading speed. We conclude that parafoveal semantic integration occurs during natural reading.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent measurement of perfusion parameters related to small blood and lymphatic vessels in the human brain using dynamic dual-spin-echo perfusion (DDSEP) MRI</a></h4>

              
                PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence from recent studies has indicated the importance of studying the interaction between the microvascular and lymphatic systems in the brain. To date, most imaging methods can only measure blood or lymphatic vessels separately, such as dynamic-susceptibility-contrast (DSC) MRI for blood vessels and DSC MRI in the CSF (cDSC MRI) for lymphatic vessels. An approach that can measure both blood and lymphatic vessels in a single scan will offer the advantages such as halved scan time and contrast dosage. Based on previous works on DSC and cDSC MRI, this study proposes an MRI approach for concurrent measurement of perfusion parameters related to small blood and lymphatic vessels in the brain within one single scan. METHODS: Bloch simulations were performed to optimize a dual-echo sequence for the measurement of gadolinium(Gd)-induced blood and CSF signal changes using a short and a long echo time, respectively. MRI experiments were performed in healthy subjects to evaluate the dual-echo approach by comparing it with existing separate methods. RESULTS: The proposed method showed consistent results in human brains as previous studies using separate methods. Signal changes from small blood vessels occurred faster than lymphatic vessels after intravenous Gd-injection. CONCLUSION: Gd-induced signal changes in blood and CSF can be detected simultaneously in healthy subjects with the proposed sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study in which the temporal difference in Gd-induced signal changes from small blood and lymphatic vessels after intravenous Gd-injection was measured in the same human subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clinical, socio-demographic, and parental correlates of early autism traits</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Autism traits typically emerge between the ages of 1 and 2. It is not known if experiences which increase the likelihood of childhood autism are related to early trait emergence, or if other exposures are more important. Identifying factors linked to toddler autism traits may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying atypical neurodevelopment. Objective: To characterise the association between 18-month autism traits and clinical, socio-demographic, and parental factors. Design: This is a cohort study of toddlers (n=536). Clinical, socio-demographic, and parental information was collected at birth (gestational age at birth, sex, maternal body mass index, age, parental education level, parental first language, parental history of neurodevelopmental disorders) and at 18 months (parent cohabiting status, two measures of social deprivation, three measures of maternal parenting style, and a measure of maternal postnatal depression). General neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (BSID-III), and autism traits were assessed using the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). Multivariable models were used to identify associations between variables and Q-CHAT. A model including BSID-III was used to identify factors associated with Q-CHAT independent of general neurodevelopment. Models were also evaluated addressing variable collinearity with principal component analysis (PCA). Setting: Single centre (London, UK). Participants: Sub-sample from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Results: A multivariable model explained 20% of Q-CHAT variance, with four individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and two measures of socio-economic deprivation). After adding general neurodevelopment into the model 37% of Q-CHAT variance was explained, with three individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and one measure of language development). After addressing variable collinearity with PCA, experience of early life adversity was positively correlated with Q-CHAT score via a single principal component, independently of general neurodevelopment. Neither sex nor family history of autism were associated with Q-CHAT score. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings question whether potential autism diagnoses are being missed in more socially deprived groups, or if there are unidentified factors influencing the likelihood of transitioning from early traits at age 18 months to a clinical autism diagnosis in childhood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A highly expressed odorant receptor from the yellow fever mosquito, AaegOR11, responds to (+)- and (-)-fenchone and a phenolic repellent</a></h4>

              
                The cornerstone of the reverse chemical ecology approach is the identification of odorant receptors (OR) sensitive to compounds in a large panel of odorants. In this approach, we de-orphanize ORs and, subsequently, measure behaviors elicited by these semiochemicals. After that, we evaluate behaviorally active compounds for applications in insect vector management. Intriguingly, multiple ORs encoded by genes highly expressed in mosquito antennae do not respond to any test odorant. One such case is CquiOR125 from the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say. To better understand CquiOR125 role in Culex mosquito olfaction, we have cloned a CquiOR125 orthologue in the genome of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.), AaegOR11. Unlike the unresponsive nature of the orthologue in Cx. quinquefasciatus, oocytes co-expressing AaegOR11 and AaegOrco elicited robust responses when challenged with fenchone, 2,3-dimethylphenol, 3,4-dimethylphenol, 4-methycyclohexanol, and acetophenone. AlphaFold models showed that AaegOR11 and CquiOR125 share structural homolog cores with MhraOR5, the only insect OR structure (PDB: 7LID) elucidated to date. Interestingly, AaegOR11 responded strongly and equally to (+)- and (-)-fenchone, with no chiral discrimination. Contrary to reports in the literature, fenchone did not show any repellency activity against Ae. aegypti or Cx. quinquefasciatus. Laboratory and field tests did not show significant increases in egg captures in cups filled with fenchone solutions compared to control cups. The second most potent ligand, 2,3-dimethylphenol, showed repellency activity stronger than that elicited by DEET at the same dose. We, therefore, concluded that AaegOR11 is a mosquito repellent sensor. It is feasible that CquiOR125 responds to repellents that remain elusive.

This feature of thalamocortical wiring is thought to create columnar, ON/OFF domains in V1. We have recently shown that mice also have ON/OFF cortical domains, but the organization of their thalamic afferents remains unknown. Here we measured the visual responses of thalamocortical boutons using two-photon imaging and found they also cluster in space according to ON/OFF responses. Moreover, fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF boutons mirrors fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF receptive field positions on the visual field. These findings indicate that there is a segregation of ON/OFF signals already present in the thalamic input, a result that may reflect the spatial organization of retinal ganglion cell mosaics themselves.

                Neuroinflammation is a key factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including prion disease. There are currently no effective treatments to halt pathogenesis and progression, which includes accumulation of misfolded proteins, neuroinflammation, and cognitive/behavioral deficits followed by irreversible neuronal death. We hypothesized that downregulation of two key neuroinflammatory targets would be neuroprotective. To test this, we utilized Nanoligomers in a prion-diseased mouse to assess the impact on glial inflammation, behavioral/cognition deficits, and loss of neurons. Nanoligomer treated mice displayed decreased numbers of glia, and improved behavior and cognitive tests. Critically, the Nanoligomer protected the brain from prion-induced spongiotic change, neuronal loss, and significantly increased life span, indicating that Nanoligomer inhibition of inflammatory pathways can prevent neuronal death and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

                Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method that records the brain signals with time resolution in the millisecond range, thereby allowing the monitoring of subjects mental states in real-time. Using appropriate biomarkers extracted from these EEG signals and presenting them back in a neurofeedback loop can foster neural compensation mechanisms by teaching subjects to modulate their brain activity. Over the last decades, several neural biomarkers of aging have been described, with growing evidence suggesting that neuromodulation may have an important role in regulating brain activity in the elderly. Methods and objectives: We used three neural biomarkers of aging, namely the Peak Alpha Frequency, the Gamma-band synchronization, and the Theta/Beta ratio, in the framework of an EEG-based brain-computer interface, with two main objectives: 1) to test whether healthy elderly people with subjective memory complaints may learn to modulate their brain activity through EEG-neurofeedback training in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study; and 2) whether that neuromodulation may have a positive impact on subjects cognition. Results: A significant self-modulation of two neural biomarkers that usually decline with age was observed exclusively in the group of subjects who underwent the EEG-neurofeedback training, in clear contrast with the subjects who received the sham feedback. This neuromodulation did not have a direct effect on subjects cognitive abilities, as measured by neuropsychological tests pre- versus post-training, probably because all the subjects accurately performed these tests already at study entry (i.e., pre-training). Conclusion: The results of this double-blind study are in line with one of the main criteria for successful neuromodulation, thus encouraging research on EEG-neurofeedback as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for promoting self-regulation of brain activity with a view to improve cognitive aging.

                Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex is thought to contribute to adaptive behavior by integrating temporally dispersed, behaviorally-relevant factors. Past work has revealed a variety of neural representations preceding actions, which are involved in internal processes like planning, working memory and covert attention. Task-related activity following actions has often been reported, but so far lacks a clear interpretation. We leveraged modified versions of classic oculomotor paradigms and population recordings to show that post-saccadic activity is a dominant signal in dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex that is distinct from pre-saccadic activity. Unlike pre-saccadic activity, post-saccadic activity occurs after each saccade, although its strength and duration are modulated by task context and expected rewards. In contrast to representations preceding actions, which appear to be mixed randomly across neurons, post-saccadic activity results in representations that are highly structured at the single-neuron and population level. Overall, the properties of post-saccadic activity are consistent with those of an action memory, an internal process with a possible role in learning and updating spatial representations.

                When we internally generate complex mental images, we need to combine multiple features or parts of a scene into a coherent whole. Direct evidence for such feature integration during visual imagery is still lacking. Moreover, cognitive control mechanisms, including memory and attention, exert top-down influences on the perceptual system when generating mental images. However, it is unclear whether such top-down processing is specific to the content of visual imagery or not. Feature integration and top-down processing involve short-range connectivity within visual areas, and long-range connectivity between control areas and visual areas, respectively. Here, we used a minimally constrained experimental paradigm wherein imagery categories were prompted using visual word cues only, and we decoded face versus place imagery - two object categories that are well-known to be associated with different visual features and neural generators - based on their distinct connectivity patterns. Our results show that face and place imagery can be decoded from both short-range and long-range connections. These findings suggest that feature integration within visual areas does not need an external stimulus to be triggered but occurs also for purely internally generated images. Furthermore, control areas associated with memory and attention provide information that is specific to the imagery content. Mental imagery belongs to a class of internally driven cognitive processes that has been notoriously challenging to decode because the relevant endogenous signals are temporally misaligned across trials. We suggest that our successful application of covariance-based connectivity decoding to visual imagery paves the way for future applications to internally driven cognitive processes such as visual attention, visual working memory and visual prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preserved neural population dynamics across animals performing similar behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Animals of the same species often exhibit similar behaviours that are advantageously adapted to their body and their environment. These behaviours are shaped by selection pressures over evolutionary timescales at the species level, yet each individual produces these behaviours using a different, uniquely constructed brain. It remains unclear how these common behavioural adaptations emerge from the idiosyncratic neural circuitry of a given individual. Here, we hypothesised that the adaptive behaviour of a species requires specific neural population 'latent dynamics'. These latent dynamics should thus be preserved and identifiable across individuals within a species, regardless of the idiosyncratic aspects of each individual's brain. Using recordings of neural populations from monkey and mouse motor cortex, we show that individuals from the same species share surprisingly similar neural dynamics when they perform the same behaviour. The similarity in neural population dynamics extends beyond cortical regions to the dorsal striatum, an evolutionarily older structure, and also holds when animals consciously plan future movements without overt behaviour. These preserved dynamics are behaviourally-relevant, allowing decoding of intended and ongoing movements across individuals. We posit that these emergent neural population dynamics result from evolutionarily-imposed constraints on brain development, and reflect a fundamental property of the neural basis of behaviour.

                The adult brain demonstrates remarkable multisensory plasticity by dynamically recalibrating information from multiple sensory sources. When a systematic visual-vestibular heading offset is experienced, the unisensory perceptual estimates recalibrate toward each other (in opposite directions) to reduce the conflict. The neural substrate of this recalibration is unknown. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity from the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd), parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas in three male rhesus macaques during visual-vestibular recalibration. Both visual and vestibular tuning in MSTd recalibrated - each according to their respective cues perceptual shifts. Vestibular tuning in PIVC also recalibrated together with corresponding perceptual shifts (cells were not visually tuned). By contrast, VIP neurons demonstrated a unique phenomenon: both vestibular and visual tuning recalibrated according to vestibular perceptual shifts. Such that, visual tuning shifted, surprisingly, contrary to visual perceptual shifts. Therefore, while unsupervised recalibration (to reduce cue conflict) occurs in early multisensory cortices, higher-level VIP reflects only a global shift, in vestibular space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigating the ability of astrocytes to drive neural network synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental works have implicated astrocytes as a significant cell type underlying several neuronal processes in the mammalian brain, from encoding sensory information to neurological disorders. Despite this progress, it is still unclear how astrocytes are communicating with and driving their neuronal neighbors. While previous computational modeling works have helped propose mechanisms responsible for driving these interactions, they have primarily focused on interactions at the synaptic level, with microscale models of calcium dynamics and neurotransmitter diffusion. Since it is computationally infeasible to include the intricate microscale details in a network-scale model, little computational work has been done to understand how astrocytes may be influencing spiking patterns and synchronization of large networks. We overcome this issue by first developing an "effective" astrocyte that can be easily implemented to already established network frameworks. We do this by showing that the astrocyte proximity to a synapse makes synaptic transmission faster, weaker, and less reliable. Thus, our "effective" astrocytes can be incorporated by considering heterogeneous synaptic time constants, which are parametrized only by the degree of astrocytic proximity at that synapse. We then apply our framework to large networks of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons with various spatial structures. Depending on key parameters, such as the number of synapses ensheathed and the strength of this ensheathment, we show that astrocytes can push the network to a synchronous state and exhibit spatially correlated patterns.

                The highly-conserved stomatin domain has been identified in genes throughout all classes of life. In animals, different stomatin domain-encoding genes have been implicated in the function of the kidney, red blood cells, and specific neuron types, though the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In one well-studied example of stomatin domain gene function, the C. elegans gene mec-2 and its mouse homologue Stoml3 are required for the function of mechanosensory neurons, where they modulate the activity of mechanosensory ion channels on the plasma membrane. Here we identify an additional shared function for mec-2 and Stoml3 in a very different sensory context, that of olfaction. In worms, we find that a subset of stomatin domain genes are expressed in olfactory neurons, but only mec-2 is strongly required for olfactory behavior. mec-2 acts cell-autonomously and does not have any obvious effect on olfactory neuron development or morphology, but modestly reduces olfactory neuron activity. We generate a Stoml3 knockout mouse and demonstrate that, like its worm homologue mec-2, it is required for olfactory behavior. In mice, Stoml3 is not required for odor detection, but is required for odor discrimination. Therefore, in addition to their shared roles in mechanosensory behavior, mec-2 and Stoml3 also have a shared role in olfactory behavior.

                Insufficient sleep is a major health issue. Inadequate sleep is associated with an array of poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, certain forms of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Given concerns with typical sedative hypnotic drugs for treating sleep difficulties, there is a compelling need for added alternative interventions. Here, we report results of a non-invasive electrical brain stimulation approach to optimizing sleep involving transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). A total of 25 participants (mean age: 46.3, S.D. +/-12.4, 15 females) were recruited for a null-stimulation controlled (Control condition), within subjects, randomized crossed design, that included two variants of an active condition involving 15 minutes pre-sleep tACS stimulation. To evaluate the impact on sleep quality, the two active tACS stimulation conditions were designed to modulate sleep-dependent neural activity in the theta/alpha frequency bands, with both stimulation types applied to all subjects in separate sessions. The first tACS condition used a fixed stimulation pattern across all participants, a pattern composed of stimulation at 5Hz and 10Hz. The second tACS condition used a personalized stimulation approach with the stimulation frequencies determined by each individual's peak EEG frequencies in the 4-6Hz and 9-11Hz bands. Personalized tACS stimulation increased sleep quantity (duration) by 22 minutes compared to a Control condition (p=.04), and 19 minutes compared to Fixed tACS stimulation (p=.03). Fixed stimulation did not significantly increase sleep duration compared to Control (mean: 3 minutes; p=0.75). For sleep onset, the Personalized tACS stimulation resulted in reducing the onset by 28% compared to the Fixed tACS stimulation (6 minutes faster, p=.02). For a Poor Sleep sub-group (n=13) categorized with Clinical Insomnia and with a high insomnia severity, Personalized tACS stimulation improved sleep duration by 33 minutes compared to Fixed stimulation (p=0.02), and 30 minutes compared to Control condition (p<0.1). Together, these results suggest that Personalized stimulation improves sleep quantity and time taken to fall asleep relative to Control and Fixed stimulation providing motivation for larger-scale trials for Personalized tACS as a sleep therapeutic, including for those with insomnia.

                The molecular underpinnings that govern the endoproteolytic release of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are now quite well understood. The same cannot be said for the events that precipitate the aggregation and amyloid deposition of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 14-amino-acid cyclic neuroendocrine peptide somatostatin (SST-14) has long been thought of as playing a role, foremost by controlling the expression of the Abeta clearing enzyme neprilysin, and more recently by directly interacting with Abeta oligomers. Missing have been in vivo data in a relevant Abeta amyloidosis model. Here we addressed this shortcoming by crossing AppNL-F/NL-F mice with Sst-deficient mice of identical genetic background to assess if and how the presence of Sst influences key pathological hallmarks of Abeta amyloidosis that develop in AppNL-F/NL-F mice after 10 months of age. Surprisingly, we found that Sst had no influence on whole brain neprilysin transcript, protein or activity levels, an observation that cannot be accounted for by a compensatory upregulation of the Sst paralog, cortistatin (Cort), that we observed in 15-month-old Sst-deficient mice. The absence of Sst did lead to a subtle but significant increase in the density of cortical Abeta amyloid plaques. Follow-on western blot analyses of whole brain extracts indicated that Sst interferes with early steps of Abeta assembly that manifest in Sst null brains through the appearance of SDS-stable smears of 55-150 kDa. As expected, no effect of Sst on tau steady-state levels or its phosphorylation were observed. Results from this study are easier reconciled with an emerging body of data that point toward Sst affecting Abeta amyloid plaque formation through direct interference with Abeta aggregation rather than through its effects on neprilysin expression.

                To make adaptive decisions, we build an internal model of associative relationships in the environment and use it to predict specific forthcoming outcomes. Detailed stimulus-outcome memories are a core feature of such cognitive maps, yet little is known of the neuronal systems that support their encoding. We used fiber photometry, cell-type and pathway-specific optogenetic manipulation, Pavlovian cue-reward conditioning, and a decision-making test in male and female rats, to reveal that ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTADA) projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) drive the encoding of stimulus-outcome memories. Dopamine is released in the BLA during stimulus-outcome pairing and VTADA[-&gt;]BLA activity is necessary and sufficient to link the identifying features of a reward to a predictive cue, but does not mediate general value or reinforcement. These data reveal a dopaminergic pathway for the learning that supports adaptive decision making and help understand how VTADA neurons achieve their emerging multifaceted role in learning.

                Training spiking recurrent neural networks on neuronal recordings or behavioral tasks has become a prominent tool to study computations in the brain. With an increasing size and complexity of neural recordings, there is a need for fast algorithms that can scale to large datasets. We present optimized CPU and GPU implementations of the recursive least-squares algorithm in spiking neural networks. The GPU implementation allows training networks to reproduce neural activity of an order of millions neurons at order of magnitude times faster than the CPU implementation. We demonstrate this by applying our algorithm to reproduce the activity of >66,000 recorded neurons of a mouse performing a decision-making task. The fast implementation enables efficient training of large-scale spiking models, thus allowing for in-silico study of the dynamics and connectivity underlying multi-area computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conserved YKL-40 changes in mice and humans after postoperative delirium.</a></h4>

              
                Delirium is a common postoperative neurologic complication among older adults. Despite its prevalence of 14-50% and likely association with inflammation, the exact mechanisms underlying postoperative delirium are unclear. This project aimed at characterizing systemic and central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory changes following surgery in both mice and humans. Matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the Investigating Neuroinflammation Underlying Postoperative Brain Connectivity Changes, Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Delirium in Older Adults (INTUIT; NCT03273335) were used to parallel murine endpoints. Delirium-like behavior was evaluated in aged mice using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test (5-CSRTT). Using a well-established orthopedic surgical model in the FosTRAP reporter mouse, we detected neuronal changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in attention, but notably not in the hippocampus. In aged mice, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels increased after orthopedic surgery, but hippocampal YKL-40 expression was decreased. Given the growing role of YKL-40 in delirium and other neurodegenerative conditions, we assayed human plasma and CSF samples. Plasma YKL-40 levels were also similarly increased after surgery, with a trend toward greater post-operative plasma YKL-40 increase in patients with delirium. In contrast to plasma, YKL-40 levels in CSF decreased following surgery, which paralleled the findings in the mouse brain. Finally, we confirmed changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) after surgery as early as 9 hours in mice, which warrants for more detailed and acute evaluations of BBB integrity following surgery in humans. All together, these results provide a nuanced understanding of the neuroimmune interactions underlying post-operative delirium in mice and humans, and highlight translational biomarkers to test potential cellular targets and mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A computational understanding of zoomorphic perception in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                It is common to find objects that resemble animals on purpose (e.g., toys). While the perception of such objects as animal-like seems obvious to humans, such Animal bias for zoomorphic objects turned out to be a striking discrepancy between the human brain and artificial visual systems known as deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide a computational understanding of the human Animal bias. We successfully induced this bias in DNNs trained explicitly with zoomorphic objects. Alternative training schedules, focusing on previously identified differences between the brain and DNNs, failed to cause an Animal bias. Specifically, we considered the superordinate distinction between animate and inanimate classes, the sensitivity for faces and bodies, the bias for shape over texture, and the role of ecologically valid categories. These findings provide computational support that the Animal bias for zoomorphic objects is a unique property of human perception yet can be explained by human learning history.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perturbation variance suppresses error sensitivity in the implicit learning system</a></h4>

              
                When variability is added to a sensorimotor perturbation, total adaptation is impaired. In Albert et al. we explored this phenomenon, and observed that it is the brain's implicit, i.e., subconscious learning system that is most affected by perturbation variance. We observed that perturbation variability impaired implicit learning by downregulating its sensitivity to error. Recently, Wang et al. present an alternate viewpoint: implicit error sensitivity does not change with experience, only the errors observed by the implicit system change. Here we evaluated this alternate view by empirically measuring error sensitivity as a function of error size. We found that perturbation variability strongly downregulates implicit error sensitivity when controlling for error size, consistent with our original results, counter to the inflexible model argued by Wang et al. With that said, a pre-existing relationship between error sensitivity and error magnitude noted by Wang et al. can contribute at least in part to implicit behavior. State-space models that start with this pre-existing error sensitivity curve and then update it with training according to a 'memory of errors' most accurately tracked measured behavior.

                Microwire microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have been a popular low-cost tool for chronic electrophysiological recordings. Multi-MEA implantations can reveal electrical dynamics crucial to brain function. However, both the fabrication and implantation procedures for multi-MEAs on a single rodent are time-consuming and highly manual skill-dependent for quality. To enable in-house design, fabrication, and implantation of custom microwire MEAs, we developed (1) a computer-aided designed and 3D printed skull cap for pre-determined implantation locations of each MEA and (2) a benchtop fabrication approach for low-cost custom microwire MEAs. A proof-of-concept design of 32-channel 4-MEA (8-wire each) recording system was prototyped and tested through Sprague Dawley rat recordings. The skull cap design based on CT-scan of single rat conforms well with multiple Sprague Dawley rats of various size, age, and weight with minimal bregma alignment error. The prototyped 32-channel system were able to record spiking activities over 5 months. In comparison with conventional stereotactic surgeries, the skull cap system simplifies the implantation location alignment for each MEA by embedding them into the pre-printed designs, thus dramatically reducing the surgical time and effort and increasing the accuracy and repeatability. Compared to commercially available custom microwire MEAs, this in-house fabrication method enables neuroscience labs to create a custom recording apparatus with lower cost and shorter lead time for design modifications. A new methodology for neuroscience labs to fabricate and insert custom microwire MEAs has been developed and it could be easily generalized to enable low-cost highly-custom multi-region recording/stimulation studies.

                Basal dendrites of layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit Na+ and NMDAR spikes, and are uniquely poised to influence somatic output. Nevertheless, due to technical limitations, how multibranch basal dendritic integration shapes action-potential output remains poorly mapped. Here, we combine 3D two-photon holographic transmitter-uncaging, whole-cell dynamic-clamp, and biophysical modeling, to reveal how synchronously activated synapses (distributed and clustered) across multiple basal dendritic branches impacts action-potential generation, under quiescent and in vivo like conditions. While dendritic Na+ spikes promote milli-second precision, distributed inputs and NMDAR spikes modulate firing rates via axo-somatic persistent sodium channel amplification. Action-potential precision, noise-enhanced responsiveness, and improved temporal resolution, were observed under high conductance states, revealing multiplexed dendritic control of somatic output amidst noisy membrane-voltage fluctuations and backpropagating spikes. Our results unveil a critical multibranch integration framework in which a delicate interplay between distributed synapses, clustered synapses, and axo-somatic subthreshold conductances, dictates somatic spike precision and gain.

                Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by episodes of severe headache. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), the electrophysiological equivalent of migraine aura, results in the opening of pannexin-1 megachannels that release ATP and triggers parenchymal neuroinflammatory signaling cascade in the cortex. Migraine symptoms suggesting subcortical dysfunction bring subcortical spread of CSD under the light. Here, we investigated the role of purinergic P2X7 receptors on the subcortical spread of CSD and its consequent neuroinflammation using a potent and selective P2X7 antagonist, JNJ-47965567. P2X7 antagonism had no effect on the CSD threshold and characteristics but increased the latency to hypothalamic voltage deflection following CSD showing that ATP acts as a mediator in the subcortical spread. P2X7 antagonism also prevented hypothalamic neuronal activation following CSD, revealed by bilateral decrease in hypothalamic c-fos positive neuron count. P2X7 antagonism further stopped the CSD-induced neuroinflammation revealed by decreased nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B-p65 in astrocytes and decreased HMGB1 release. Following CSD we observed an increase in neuronal cytoplasmic P2X7R signal in the cortex and subcortical structures (thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus) concordant with the neuroinflammation which is also prevented by P2X7R antagonism. In conclusion, our data suggest that P2X7R plays an imperative role in CSD-induced neuroinflammation, the subcortical spread of CSD, and CSD-induced hypothalamic neuronal activation hence can be a potential target in migraine treatment.

                Brainstem olivocochlear neurons (OCNs) modulate the earliest stages of auditory processing through feedback projections to the cochlea and have been shown to influence hearing and protect the ear from sound-induced damage through unclear mechanisms. Here, we used single-nucleus sequencing, anatomical reconstructions, and electrophysiology to characterize OCNs during postnatal development and after sound exposure. We identified markers for known OCN subtypes, medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) OCNs, and show that they express distinct cohorts of physiologically relevant genes that change over development. In addition, we discovered a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype that produces Neuropeptide Y along with other neurotransmitters. Throughout the cochlea, both LOC subtypes extend arborizations over wide frequency domains. Moreover, LOC neuropeptide expression is strongly upregulated days after acoustic trauma, potentially providing a sustained protective signal to the cochlea. OCNs are therefore poised to have diffuse, dynamic effects on early auditory processing over timescales ranging from milliseconds to days.

                Multimorbidity, co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions, is one of the top priorities in global health research and has emerged as the gold standard approach to study disease accumulation. As aging underlies the development of many chronic conditions, surrogate aging biomarkers are not disease-specific and capture health at the whole person level, having the potential to improve our understanding of multimorbidity. Biological age has been examined in recent years as a surrogate biomarker to capture the process of aging. However, relatively few studies have investigated the relationship between biological age and multimorbidity. More research is needed to quantify biological age using a broad range of biological markers and multimorbidity based on a comprehensive set of chronic conditions. Brain age estimated by neuroimaging data and machine learning models is another surrogate aging biomarker predictive of a wide range of health outcomes. Little is known about the relationship between brain age and multimorbidity. To answer these questions, our study investigates whether elevated biological age and accelerated brain age are associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity using a large dataset from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Refresher study. Ensemble learning is utilized to combine multiple machine learning models to estimate biological age using a comprehensive set of biological markers. Brain age is obtained using convolutional neural networks and neuroimaging data. Our study is the first to examine the relationship between accelerated brain age and multimorbidity and presents the first effort to test whether sex moderates the relationship between these surrogate aging biomarkers and multimorbidity. Furthermore, it is the first attempt to explore how biological age and brain age are related to multimorbidity in mental health. Our findings hold the potential to advance the understanding of the accumulation of physical and mental health conditions, which may contribute to new strategies to improve the treatment of multimorbidity and detection of at-risk individuals.

	<p>Although subjective conscious experience and introspection have long been considered unscientific and banned from psychology, they are indispensable in scientific practice. These terms are used in scientific contexts today; however, their meaning remains vague, and earlier objections to the distinction between conscious experience and unconscious processing, remain valid. This also applies to the distinction between conscious visual perception and unconscious visual processing. Damage to the geniculo-striate pathway or the visual cortex results in a perimetrically blind visual hemifield contralateral to the damaged hemisphere. In some cases, cerebral blindness is not absolute. Patients may still be able to guess the presence, location, shape or direction of movement of a stimulus even though they report no conscious visual experience. This &amp;amp;ldquo;unconscious&amp;amp;rdquo; ability was termed &amp;amp;ldquo;blindsight&amp;amp;rdquo;. The present paper demonstrates how the term conscious visual experience can be introduced in a logically precise and methodologically correct way and becomes amenable to scientific examination. The distinction between conscious experience and unconscious processing is demonstrated in the cases of conscious vision and blindsight. The literature on &amp;amp;ldquo;blindsight&amp;amp;rdquo; and its neurobiological basis is reviewed. It is shown that blindsight can be caused by residual functions of neural networks of the visual cortex that have survived cerebral damage, and may also be due to an extrastriate pathway via the midbrain to cortical areas such as areas V4 and MT/V5.</p>

	<p>Different music training involves different hand coordination levels and may have a significant influence on brain oscillation for the executive function. However, few research has focused on the plasticity of executive function and the brain oscillation modulated by different musical instrument training modules. In this study, we recruited 18 string musicians, 20 pianists, and 19 non-musicians to perform a bimanual key pressing task during EEG recording. Behavioral results revealed that pianists have the highest accuracy and the shortest response time, followed by string musicians and non-musicians (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Time-frequency analyses of EEG revealed that pianists generated significantly greater theta power than the other groups from 500 ms to 800 ms post-stimulus in mid-central, frontal brain areas, and motor control areas. Functional connectivity analyses found that the pianists showed significantly greater connectivity in the frontal-parietal area in theta band based on phase-locking value analysis, which suggests that piano training improves executive function and enhances the connectivity between prefrontal and mid-central regions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the effects of different music training on executive function.</p>

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has become a major worldwide public health concern, given its global prevalence. It has clear links with multiple comorbidities and mortality. Cognitive impairment is one related comorbidity causing great pressure on individuals and society. The clinical manifestations of cognitive impairment in OSAS include decline in attention/vigilance, verbal&amp;amp;ndash;visual memory loss, visuospatial/structural ability impairment, and executive dysfunction. It has been proven that chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) may be a main cause of cognitive impairment in OSAS. Inflammation plays important roles in CIH-induced cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, the nuclear factor kappa B and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha pathways play significant roles in this inflammatory mechanism. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective therapy for OSAS; however, its effect on cognitive impairment is suboptimal. Therefore, in this review, we address the role inflammation plays in the development of neuro-impairment in OSAS and the association between OSAS and cognitive impairment to provide an overview of its pathophysiology. We believe that furthering the understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms involved in OSAS-associated cognitive impairment could lead to the development of appropriate and effective therapy.</p>

	<p>Background: Conformity is a process by which a person changes his original idea and attitude in response to group pressure and chooses to be consistent with the majority. The study was undertaken to explore university teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; scientific research conformity (SRC), the psychological process of information processing and the types of internal attribution in SRC, and the relationship between SRC incentives and types of internal attribution. Method: A survey of 349 teachers from seven universities was conducted. We employed the mixed-method approach; data was collected through in-depth interviews and were analyzed using AMOS. Results: In-depth interviews revealed that the basic principle of human organizational behavior is conformity with incentive, and conformity is a motivational behavior produced through psychological processing of social information. Factor analysis results revealed that teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; SRC is characterized by abidance, compliance, and obedience. The internal incentives mainly affect abidance, and have a significant impact on obedience and compliance; the environmental incentives mainly affect abidance, and have a significant impact on obedience. Family and social relationship incentives mainly affect compliance, but social relationship incentives also have a significant impact on obedience. Additionally, policy incentives have a highly significant impact on obedience. Conclusions: This study provides first-hand empirical data for studies pertaining to research motivation and SRC behavior of Chinese university teachers. It also provides a theoretical basis for subsequent research on conformity behavior.</p>

	<p>Objective: Work related electrical accidents are prevalent and can cause persisting symptoms. We used clinical neurophysiological techniques to assess neurosensory function following electrical accidents and correlated test results with the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; symptoms. Methods: We studied 24 patients who reported persisting neurosensory symptoms following a workplace electrical accident. We assessed nerve function using quantitative sensory testing (QST), thermal roller testing, laser evoked potential (LEP), and electroneurography. The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; results were compared with previously established normative data. Results: Altogether, 67% of the patients showed at least one neurosensory impairment with a large heterogeneity in test results across patients. At a group level, we observed significant deviations in in QST, LEP, and sensory and motor neurography. Overall, we found a weak correlation between test results and self-reported symptoms. Conclusions: In a majority of patients with neurosensory symptoms after a workplace electrical accident, neurosensory testing confirmed the existence of an underlying impairment of the nervous system.</p>

	<p>Music training was shown to induce changes in auditory processing in older adults. However, most findings stem from correlational studies and fewer examine long-term sustainable benefits. Moreover, research shows small and variable changes in auditory event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes and/or latencies in older adults. Conventional time domain analysis methods, however, are susceptible to latency jitter in evoked responses and may miss important information of brain processing. Here, we used time-frequency analyses to examine training-related changes in auditory-evoked oscillatory activity in healthy older adults (N = 50) assigned to a music training (n = 16), visual art training (n = 17), or a no-treatment control (n = 17) group. All three groups were presented with oddball auditory paradigms with synthesized piano tones or vowels during the acquisition of high-density EEG. Neurophysiological measures were collected at three-time points: pre-training, post-training, and at a three-month follow-up. Training programs were administered for 12-weeks. Increased theta power was found pre and post- training for the music (p = 0.010) and visual art group (p = 0.010) as compared to controls (p = 0.776) and maintained at the three-month follow-up. Results showed training-related plasticity on auditory processing in aging adults. Neuroplastic changes were maintained three months post-training, suggesting music and visual art programs yield lasting benefits that might facilitate encoding, retention, and memory retrieval.</p>

	<p>It has been reported that performing bilateral eye movements for a short period can lead to an enhancement of memory retrieval and recall (termed the &amp;amp;ldquo;saccade induced retrieval effect (SIRE)&amp;amp;rdquo;). The source of this effect has been debated within the literature and the phenomenon has come under scrutiny as the robustness of the effect has recently been questioned. To date investigations of SIRE have largely been restricted to younger adult populations. Here, across two experiments, we assess the robustness and generalisability of the SIRE specifically in relation to disease and ageing. Experiment 1 employed a between subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s design and presented younger and older participants with 36 words prior to completing one of three eye movement conditions (bilateral, antisaccade or a fixation eye movement). Participants then performed a word recognition task. Experiment 2 assessed the SIRE in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s, Mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s by employing an online within subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s design. Results showed no significant difference between groups in the number of words recognised based on eye movement condition. Neither experiment 1 or 2 replicated the SIRE effect therefore the findings from this study add to the growing number of studies that have failed to replicate the SIRE effect.</p>

                Background: Although people can pay attention to targets while ignoring distractors, previous research suggests that target enhancement and distractor suppression work separately and independently. Here, we sought to replicate previous findings and re-establish their independence. Methods: We employed an internet-based psychological experiment. We presented participants with a visual search task in which they searched for a specified shape with or without a singleton. We replicated the singleton-presence benefit in search performance, but this effect was limited to cases where the target color was fixed across all trials. In a randomly intermixed probe task (30% of all trials), the participants searched for a letter among colored probes; we used this task to assess how far attention was separately allocated toward the target or distractor dimensions. Results: We found a negative correlation between target enhancement and distractor suppression, indicating that the participants who paid closer attention to target features ignored distractor features less effectively and vice versa. Averaged data showed no benefit from target color or cost from distractor color, possibly because of the substantial differences in strategy across participants. Conclusions: These results suggest that target enhancement and distractor suppression guide attention in mutually dependent ways and that the relative contribution of these components depends on the participants’ search strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching data to uncover filament dynamics</a></h4>

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) has been extensively used to understand molecular dynamics in cells. This technique when applied to soluble, globular molecules driven by diffusion is easily interpreted and well understood. However, the classical methods of analysis cannot be applied to anisotropic structures subjected to directed transport, such as cytoskeletal filaments or elongated organelles transported along microtubule tracks. A new mathematical approach is needed to analyze FRAP data in this context and determine what information can be obtain from such experiments. To address these questions, we analyze fluorescence intensity profile curves after photobleaching of fluorescently labelled intermediate filaments anterogradely transported along microtubules. We apply the analysis to intermediate filament data to determine information about the filament motion. Our analysis consists of deriving equations for fluorescence intensity profiles and developing a mathematical model for the motion of filaments and simulating the model. Two closed forms for profile curves were derived, one for filaments of constant length and one for filaments with constant velocity, and three types of simulation were carried out. In the first type of simulation, the filaments have random velocities which are constant for the duration of the simulation. In the second type, filaments have random velocities which instantaneously change at random times. In the third type, filaments have random velocities and exhibit pausing between velocity changes. Our analysis shows: the most important distribution governing the shape of the intensity profile curves obtained from filaments is the distribution of the filament velocity. Furthermore, filament length which is constant during the experiment, had little impact on intensity profile curves. Finally, gamma distributions for the filament velocity with pauses give the best fit to asymmetric fluorescence intensity profiles of intermediate filaments observed in FRAP experiments performed in polarized migrating astrocytes. Our analysis also shows that the majority of filaments are stationary. Overall, our data give new insight into the regulation of intermediate filament dynamics during cell migration.

The rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the history of outbreaks caused by zoonotic coronaviruses point to the need for next-generation vaccines that confer protection against variant strains. Here, we combined analyses of diverse sequences and structures of coronavirus spikes with data from deep mutational scanning to design SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens containing the most significant mutations that may emerge. We trained a neural network to predict RBD expression and ACE2 binding from sequence, which allowed us to determine that these antigens are stable and bind to ACE2. Thus, they represent viable variants. We then used a computational model of affinity maturation (AM) to study the antibody response to immunization with different combinations of the designed antigens. The results suggest that immunization with a cocktail of the antigens is likely to promote evolution of higher titers of antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 variants than immunization or infection with the wildtype virus alone. Finally, our analysis of 12 coronaviruses from different genera identified the S2’ cleavage site and fusion peptide as potential pan-coronavirus vaccine targets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Towards mouse genetic-specific RNA-sequencing read mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nastassia Gobet, Maxime Jan, Paul Franken, Ioannis Xenarios</p>

Genetic variations affect behavior and cause disease but understanding how these variants drive complex traits is still an open question. A common approach is to link the genetic variants to intermediate molecular phenotypes such as the transcriptome using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Paradoxically, these variants between the samples are usually ignored at the beginning of RNA-seq analyses of many model organisms. This can skew the transcriptome estimates that are used later for downstream analyses, such as expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) detection. Here, we assessed the impact of reference-based analysis on the transcriptome and eQTLs in a widely-used mouse genetic population: the BXD panel of recombinant inbred lines. We highlight existing reference bias in the transcriptome data analysis and propose practical solutions which combine available genetic variants, genotypes, and genome reference sequence. The use of custom BXD line references improved downstream analysis compared to classical genome reference. These insights would likely benefit genetic studies with a transcriptomic component and demonstrate that genome references need to be reassessed and improved.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">General object-based features account for letter perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Janini, Chris Hamblin, Arturo Deza, Talia Konkle</p>

After years of experience, humans become experts at perceiving letters. Is this visual capacity attained by learning specialized letter features, or by reusing general visual features previously learned in service of object categorization? To explore this question, we first measured the perceptual similarity of letters in two behavioral tasks, visual search and letter categorization. Then, we trained deep convolutional neural networks on either 26-way letter categorization or 1000-way object categorization, as a way to operationalize possible specialized letter features and general object-based features, respectively. We found that the general object-based features more robustly correlated with the perceptual similarity of letters. We then operationalized additional forms of experience-dependent letter specialization by altering object-trained networks with varied forms of letter training; however, none of these forms of letter specialization improved the match to human behavior. Thus, our findings reveal that it is not necessary to appeal to specialized letter representations to account for perceptual similarity of letters. Instead, we argue that it is more likely that the perception of letters depends on domain-general visual features.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-GWAS coherence test at the gene and pathway level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Krefl, Sven Bergmann</p>

Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are also not independent. Methods already exist to account for this when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end, we devised a new significance test for the covariance of datapoints not drawn independently but with a known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> distributions with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies’ algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the gene level. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between the severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to <i>T</i><sub>H</sub>1 versus <i>T</i><sub>H</sub>2 immune response, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting the severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving datapoints with known auto-correlation structures.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systems-level identification of key transcription factors in immune cell specification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cong Liu, Kyla Omilusik, Clara Toma, Nadia S. Kurd, John T. Chang, Ananda W. Goldrath, Wei Wang</p>

Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for regulating cell differentiation during the development of the immune system. However, the key TFs for orchestrating the specification of distinct immune cells are not fully understood. Here, we integrated the transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements in 73 mouse and 61 human primary cell types, respectively, that span the immune cell differentiation pathways. We constructed the cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory network and assessed the global importance of TFs based on the Taiji framework, which is a method we have previously developed that can infer the global impact of TFs using integrated transcriptomic and epigenetic data. Integrative analysis across cell types revealed putative driver TFs in cell lineage-specific differentiation in both mouse and human systems. We have also identified TF combinations that play important roles in specific developmental stages. Furthermore, we validated the functions of predicted novel TFs in murine CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and showed the importance of Elf1 and Prdm9 in the effector versus memory T cell fate specification and Kdm2b and Tet3 in promoting differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory (Trm) cells, validating the approach. Thus, we have developed a bioinformatic approach that provides a global picture of the regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular differentiation in the immune system and aids the discovery of novel mechanisms in cell fate decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Deep Survival EWAS approach estimating risk profile based on pre-diagnostic DNA methylation: An application to breast cancer time to diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michela Carlotta Massi, Lorenzo Dominoni, Francesca Ieva, Giovanni Fiorito</p>

Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the Time To Diagnosis (TTD), or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we aim to identify blood DNAm profiles associated with TTD, with the aim to improve the reliability of the results, as well as their biological meaningfulness. We argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deals with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interactions between attributions and beliefs at trial-by-trial level: Evidence from a novel computer game task</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elena Zamfir, Peter Dayan</p>

Inferring causes of the good and bad events that we experience is part of the process of building models of our own capabilities and of the world around us. Making such inferences can be difficult because of complex reciprocal relationships between attributions of the causes of particular events, and beliefs about the capabilities and skills that influence our role in bringing them about. Abnormal causal attributions have long been studied in connection with psychiatric disorders, notably depression and paranoia; however, the mechanisms behind attributional inferences and the way they can go awry are not fully understood. We administered a novel, challenging, game of skill to a substantial population of healthy online participants, and collected trial-by-trial time series of both their beliefs about skill and attributions about the causes of the success and failure of real experienced outcomes. We found reciprocal relationships that provide empirical confirmation of the attribution-self representation cycle theory. This highlights the dynamic nature of the processes involved in attribution, and validates a framework for developing and testing computational accounts of attribution-belief interactions.

                Background: Chimarrogale leander is a species of the family Soricidae and is mainly distributed in southern China. Methods: Here, a complete mitochondrial genome for C. leander was assembled via high-throughput sequencing technology. Results The results showed that the complete mitogenome of C. leander is 17,357 bp and includes 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and one control region. The nucleotide composition is A: 33.1%, T: 31.5%, C: 22.5% and G: 12.9%. Through the phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial genome, it is found that C. leander has a close genetic relationship with Nectogale elegans. Conclusions: The new mitogenome will hopefully prove useful for systematic analyses of genus Chimarrogale.

                Background: Asthma is a major global health issue characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is linked to a high disease burden and disproportionately high healthcare utilization in severe, uncontrolled cases compared to non-severe asthma. We aimed to conduct this survey among primary school teachers in Baghdad, Iraq, to assess their level of knowledge about asthma and confidence in managing school children with asthma. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Baghdad. The study adopted a questionnaire for assessing the asthma knowledge and confidence scores regarding the management of asthmatic children. This questionnaire contained 29-multiple true-false questions based on different aspects, including facts about asthma and the management of asthma by teachers. The questionnaire for testing teachers’ knowledge of asthma and confidence scores regarding the management of asthmatic children was distributed to 150 teachers. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 103 teachers.. Approximately 71% of teachers answered the question ‘What are the three main symptoms of asthma?’ correctly i.e., answering either one symptom (35.9%) or two symptoms (35.9%) correctly. A relatively smaller number of teachers (16.5%) mentioned all three symptoms correctly. Across the 29-multiple true-false questions, more than 75% of teachers answered 11 questions correctly, 50-74% of teachers answered the rest of eight questions appropriately, and <50% of teachers answered the remaining 10 questions properly. The statistical evaluation indicated that the mean total knowledge score about asthma for all the teachers was 20.27 ± 2.97 and the mean total confidence score regarding the management of asthmatic children was 72.44 ± 13.61. Conclusions: This study suggests that teachers from the schools in Baghdad appear to be self-confident in their ability and knowledge to help and manage children with asthma.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lungfish are the fish related most closely to tetrapods. The olfactory organ of lungfish contains two distinct sensory epithelia: the lamellar olfactory epithelium (OE) and the recess epithelium (RecE). Based on their ultrastructural and histological characteristics, the lamellar OE and the RecE are considered to correspond respectively to the teleost OE and a primitive vomeronasal organ (VNO). In tetrapods, the OE and VNO have been shown to express different families of olfactory receptors; for example, in mammals, the OE expresses odorant receptors and trace amine-associated receptors, while the VNO expresses type 1 (V1Rs) and type 2 (V2Rs) vomeronasal receptors. In the present study, we examined the expression of V1Rs in the olfactory organs of two African lungfish, <i>Protopterus annectens</i> and <i>Protopterus amphibius</i>. RNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses identified 29 V1R genes in <i>P. annectens</i> and 50 V1R genes in <i>P. amphibius</i>. Most V1Rs identified in these lungfish were classified as the tetrapod-type V1Rs initially found in tetrapods and distinct from fish-type V1Rs. In teleost, which all lack a VNO, all olfactory receptors are expressed in the OE, while in <i>Xenopus</i> V1Rs are expressed exclusively in the OE, and not in the VNO. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that lungfish V1Rs were expressed mainly in the lamellar OE and rarely in the RecE. These results imply that V1R expression in lungfish represents an intermediate step toward the complete segregation of V1R expression between the OE and VNO, reflecting the phylogenetic position of lungfish between teleosts and amphibians.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Disentangling the roles of circadian rhythms and sleep drive in experimental pain sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Differentiating between circadian rhythm and sleep’s effect on pain is challenging, as these two systems can be tightly coupled. A recent study by Daguet et al. found that circadian rhythm, rather than sleep drive, significantly contributed to the variability of experimental heat pain sensitivity in humans. These results support chrono-pharmacological approaches to pain management.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fat2 polarizes the WAVE complex in trans to align cell protrusions for collective migration</a></h4>

              
                For a group of cells to migrate together, each cell must couple the polarity of its migratory machinery with that of the other cells in the cohort. Although collective cell migrations are common in animal development, little is known about how protrusions are coherently polarized among groups of migrating epithelial cells. We address this problem in the collective migration of the follicular epithelial cells in Drosophila melanogaster. In this epithelium, the cadherin Fat2 localizes to the trailing edge of each cell and promotes the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of the cell behind. We show that Fat2 performs this function by acting in trans to concentrate the activity of the WASP family verprolin homolog regulatory complex (WAVE complex) at one long-lived region along each cell's leading edge. Without Fat2, the WAVE complex distribution expands around the cell perimeter and fluctuates over time, and protrusive activity is reduced and unpolarized. We further show that Fat2's influence is very local, with sub-micron-scale puncta of Fat2 enriching the WAVE complex in corresponding puncta just across the leading-trailing cell-cell interface. These findings demonstrate that a trans interaction between Fat2 and the WAVE complex creates stable regions of protrusive activity in each cell and aligns the cells' protrusions across the epithelium for directionally persistent collective migration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Post-phagocytosis activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by two novel T6SS effectors</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is used by bacteria to deliver toxic effectors directly into target cells. Most T6SSs mediate antibacterial activities, whereas the potential anti-eukaryotic role of T6SS remains understudied. Here, we found a <i>Vibrio</i> T6SS that delivers two novel effectors into mammalian host immune cells. We showed that these effectors induce a pyroptotic cell death in a phagocytosis-dependent manner; we identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as being the underlying mechanism leading to the T6SS-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, we identified a compensatory T6SS-induced pathway that is activated upon inhibition of the canonical pyroptosis pathway. Genetic analyses revealed possible horizontal spread of this T6SS and its anti-eukaryotic effectors into emerging pathogens in the marine environment. Our findings reveal novel T6SS effectors that activate the host inflammasome and possibly contribute to virulence and to the emergence of bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">c-Myc plays a key role in IFN-γ-induced persistence of Chlamydia trachomatis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr)</i> can persist over extended times within their host cell and thereby establish chronic infections. One of the major inducers of chlamydial persistence is interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) released by immune cells as a mechanism of immune defence. IFN-γ activates the catabolic depletion of L-tryptophan (Trp) via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), resulting in persistent <i>Ctr</i>. Here, we show that IFN-γ induces the downregulation of c-Myc, the key regulator of host cell metabolism, in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of c-Myc rescued <i>Ctr</i> from IFN-γ-induced persistence in cell lines and human fallopian tube organoids. Trp concentrations control c-Myc levels most likely via the PI3K-GSK3β axis. Unbiased metabolic analysis revealed that <i>Ctr</i> infection reprograms the host cell tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support pyrimidine biosynthesis. Addition of TCA cycle intermediates or pyrimidine/purine nucleosides to infected cells rescued <i>Ctr</i> from IFN-γ-induced persistence. Thus, our results challenge the longstanding hypothesis of Trp depletion through IDO as the major mechanism of IFN-γ-induced metabolic immune defence and significantly extends the understanding of the role of IFN-γ as a broad modulator of host cell metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early anteroposterior regionalisation of human neural crest is shaped by a pro-mesodermal factor</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest (NC) is an important multipotent embryonic cell population and its impaired specification leads to various developmental defects, often in an anteroposterior (A-P) axial level-specific manner. The mechanisms underlying the correct A-P regionalisation of human NC cells remain elusive. Recent studies have indicated that trunk NC cells, the presumed precursors of the childhood tumour neuroblastoma, are derived from neuromesodermal-potent progenitors of the postcranial body (NMPs). Here we employ human embryonic stem cell differentiation to define how NMP-derived NC cells acquire a posterior axial identity. We show that TBXT, a pro-mesodermal transcription factor, mediates early posterior NC/spinal cord regionalisation together with WNT signalling effectors. This occurs by TBXT-driven chromatin remodelling via its binding in key enhancers within <i>HOX</i> gene clusters and other posterior regulator-associated loci. This initial posteriorisation event is succeeded by a second phase of trunk <i>HOX</i> gene control that marks the differentiation of NMPs toward their TBXT-negative NC/spinal cord derivatives and relies predominantly on FGF signalling. Our work reveals a previously unknown role of TBXT in influencing posterior NC fate and points to the existence of temporally discrete, cell type-dependent modes of posterior axial identity control.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential requirements for mitochondrial electron transport chain components in the adult murine liver</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction due to mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome is a common cause of metabolic disease in humans and displays striking tissue specificity depending on the affected gene. The mechanisms underlying tissue specific phenotypes are not understood. Complex I (cI) is classically considered the entry point for electrons into the ETC, and <i>in vitro</i> experiments indicate that cI is required for basal respiration and maintenance of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, an indicator of cellular redox status. This finding has largely not been tested <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we report that mitochondrial complex I is dispensable for homeostasis of the adult mouse liver; animals with hepatocyte-specific loss of cI function display no overt phenotypes or signs of liver damage, and maintain liver function, redox and oxygen status. Further analysis of cI-deficient livers did not reveal significant proteomic or metabolic changes, indicating little to no compensation is required in the setting of complex I loss. In contrast, complex IV (cIV) dysfunction in adult hepatocytes results in decreased liver function, impaired oxygen handling, steatosis, and liver damage, accompanied by significant metabolomic and proteomic perturbations. Our results support a model whereby complex I loss is tolerated in the mouse liver because hepatocytes use alternative electron donors to fuel the mitochondrial ETC.

                Polygenic adaptation is thought to be ubiquitous, yet remains poorly understood. Here, we model this process analytically, in the plausible setting of a highly polygenic, quantitative trait that experiences a sudden shift in the fitness optimum. We show how the mean phenotype changes over time, depending on the effect sizes of loci that contribute to variance in the trait, and characterize the allele dynamics at these loci. Notably, we describe the two phases of the allele dynamics: The first is a rapid phase, in which directional selection introduces small frequency differences between alleles whose effects are aligned with or opposed to the shift, ultimately leading to small differences in their probability of fixation during a second, longer phase, governed by stabilizing selection. As we discuss, key results should hold in more general settings, and have important implications for efforts to identify the genetic basis of adaptation in humans and other species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fibroblast-derived Hgf controls recruitment and expansion of muscle during morphogenesis of the mammalian diaphragm</a></h4>

              
                The diaphragm is a domed muscle between the thorax and abdomen essential for breathing in mammals. Diaphragm development requires the coordinated development of muscle, connective tissue, and nerve, which are derived from different embryonic sources. Defects in diaphragm development cause the common and often lethal birth defect, congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH). HGF/MET signaling is required for diaphragm muscularization, but the source of HGF and the specific functions of this pathway in muscle progenitors and effects on phrenic nerve have not been explicitly tested. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice and pharmacological inhibition of MET, we demonstrate that the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs), transient embryonic structures that give rise to the connective tissue in the diaphragm, are the source of HGF critical for diaphragm muscularization. PPF-derived HGF is directly required for recruitment of MET+ muscle progenitors to the diaphragm and indirectly (via its effect on muscle development) required for phrenic nerve primary branching. In addition, HGF is continuously required for maintenance and motility of the pool of progenitors to enable full muscularization. Localization of HGF at the diaphragm’s leading edges directs dorsal and ventral expansion of muscle and regulates its overall size and shape. Surprisingly, large muscleless regions in <i>HGF</i> and <i>Met</i> mutants do not lead to hernias. While these regions are likely more susceptible to CDH, muscle loss is not sufficient to cause CDH.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hepatic AMPK signaling activation in response to dynamic REDOX balance is a biomarker of exercise to improve blood glucose control</a></h4>

              
                Antioxidant intervention is considered to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates hyperglycemia. Paradoxically, moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes. The exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. Here, by comparing exercise and antioxidants intervention on type 2 diabetic rats, we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMPK signaling, therefore ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, our results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox balance. These results indicate that the AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as a sensitive biomarker, reflecting the threshold of redox balance defining effective treatment in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise treatment of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organized canals enable long range directed material transport in bacterial communities</a></h4>

              
                Long-range material transport is essential to maintain the physiological functions of multicellular organisms such as animals and plants. By contrast, material transport in bacteria is often short-ranged and limited by diffusion. Here we report a unique form of actively regulated long-range directed material transport in structured bacterial communities. Using <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> colonies as a model system, we discover that a large-scale and temporally evolving open channel system spontaneously develops in the colony via shear-induced banding. Fluid flows in the open channels support high-speed (up to 450 µm/s) transport of cells and outer membrane vesicles over centimeters, and help to eradicate colonies of a competing species <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The open channels are reminiscent of human-made canals for cargo transport, and the channel flows are driven by interfacial tension mediated by cell-secreted biosurfactants. The spatial-temporal dynamics of fluid flows in the open channels are qualitatively described by flow profile measurement and mathematical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that mechanochemical coupling between interfacial force and biosurfactant kinetics can coordinate large-scale material transport in primitive life forms, suggesting a new principle to engineer self-organized microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulatory mechanisms of TARP γ8-selective AMPA receptor therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission throughout the brain. Their signalling is uniquely diversified by brain region-specific auxiliary subunits, providing an opportunity for the development of selective therapeutics. AMPARs associated with TARP {gamma}8 are enriched in the hippocampus, and are targets of emerging anti-epileptic drugs. To understand their therapeutic activity, we determined cryo-EM structures of the GluA1/2-{gamma}8 receptor associated with three potent, chemically diverse drugs. We find that despite sharing a lipid-exposed and water-accessible binding pocket, drug action is differentially affected by binding-site mutants. Together with patch-clamp recordings and MD simulations we demonstrate that ligand-triggered reorganisation of the AMPAR-TARP interface contributes to modulation. Unexpectedly, one ligand (JNJ-61432059) acts bifunctionally, negatively affecting GluA1 but exerting positive modulatory action on GluA2-containing AMPARs, in a TARP stoichiometry-dependent manner. These results further illuminate the action of TARPs, demonstrate the sensitive balance between positive and negative modulatory action, and provide a mechanistic platform for development of both positive and negative selective AMPAR modulators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal activity-related transcription is blunted in immature compared to mature dentate granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in the hippocampus during adulthood are believed to play a unique role in dentate gyrus function. Although immature DGCs have hyperexcitable membrane properties in vitro, the consequences of this hyperexcitability in vivo remain unclear. In particular, the relationship between experiences that activate the dentate gyrus, such as exploration of a novel environment (NE), and downstream molecular processes that modify dentate gyrus circuitry in response to cellular activation are unknown in this cell population. We first performed quantification of immediate early gene proteins in immature (5-week-old) and mature (13-week-old) DGCs from mice exposed to a NE. Paradoxically, we observed lower immediate early gene protein expression in hyperexcitable immature DGCs. We then isolated nuclei from active and inactive immature DGCs and performed single nuclei RNA-Sequencing. Compared to mature nuclei collected from the same animal, immature DGC nuclei showed less activity-induced transcriptional change, even though they were classified as active based on expression of ARC protein. These results demonstrate that the coupling of spatial exploration, cellular activation, and transcriptional change differs between immature and mature DGCs, with blunted activity-induced changes in immature cells.

                The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the vertebrate brain is the central pacemaker regulating circadian rhythmicity throughout the body. The SCN receives photic information through melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGC) to synchronize the body with environmental light cycles. Determining how these inputs fit into the network of synaptic connections on and between SCN neurons is key to impelling our understanding of the regulation of the circadian clock by light and unraveling the relevant local circuits within the SCN. To map these connections, we used a newly-developed Cre-dependant electron microscopy reporter, APEX2, to label mitochondria of mRGC axons, and serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to resolve the fine structure of mRGC in 3D volumes of the SCN. The maps thus created provide a first draft of the patterns of connectomic organization of SCN in the core and the shell, composed of different neuronal subtypes, and here shown to differ with regard to the patterning of their mRGC input as the shell receives denser mRGCs synaptic inputs compared to the core. This challenges the presently held view that photic information coming directly from the retina is mainly integrated by the core region of the SCN.

                Object detection is an essential function of the visual system. Although the visual cortex plays an important role in object detection, the superior colliculus can support detection when the visual cortex is ablated or silenced. Moreover, it has been shown that superficial layers of mouse SC (sSC) encode visual features of complex objects, and that this code is not inherited from the primary visual cortex. This suggests that mouse sSC may provide a significant contribution to complex object vision. Here, we use optogenetics to show that mouse sSC is causally involved in figure detection based on differences in figure contrast, orientation and phase. Additionally, our neural recordings show that in mouse sSC, image elements that belong to a figure elicit stronger activity than those same elements when they are part of the background. The discriminability of this neural code is higher for correct trials than incorrect trials. Our results provide new insight into the behavioral relevance of the visual processing that takes place in sSC.

                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that have been implicated in a plethora of neuronal processes. Nevertheless, their role in regulating brain activity in the context of sleep has so far received little attention. To test their involvement, we deleted mature miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons at two developmental ages, i.e., in early adulthood using conditional Dicer knockout (cKO) mice and in adult mice using an inducible conditional Dicer cKO (icKO) line. In both models, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was affected and the response to sleep deprivation (SD), altered; while rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) rebound was compromised in both, EEG delta (1-4 Hz) power during non-REM sleep (NREMS) was reduced in cKO mice and increased in icKO mice. We subsequently investigated the effects of SD on the miRNA transcriptome and found that the expression of 48 forebrain miRNAs was affected, in particular, the activity-dependent miRNA miR-709. In vivo inhibition of miR-709 in the brain increased EEG power during NREMS in the slow-delta (0.75-1.75 Hz) range, particularly after periods of prolonged wakefulness. Transcriptome analysis of primary cortical neurons in vitro revealed that miR-709 regulates endosomal trafficking and glutamatergic receptor activity. A subset of the genes involved in glutamatergic transmission was affected also in the cortices of sleep-deprived, miR-709-inhibited mice. Our data implicate miRNAs in the regulation of EEG activity and indicate that miR-709 links neuronal excitability during wakefulness to brain synchrony during sleep, likely through the regulation of endosomal trafficking and glutamatergic signaling.

                Traumatic Brain injury-induced disturbances in mitochondrial fission-and-fusion dynamics have been linked to the onset and propagation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, cell-type-specific contributions and crosstalk between neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in mitochondria-driven neurodegeneration after brain injury remain undefined. We developed a human three-dimensional in vitro triculture tissue model of a contusion injury, composed of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, and examined the contributions of mitochondrial dysregulation to neuroinflammation and progression of injury-induced neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies presented here suggest that fragmented mitochondria released by microglia are a key contributor to secondary neuronal damage progression after contusion injury, a pathway that requires astrocyte-microglia crosstalk. Controlling mitochondrial dysfunction thus offers an exciting option for the development of therapies for TBI patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A texture statistics encoding model reveals hierarchical feature selectivity across human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mid-level visual features, such as contour and texture, provide a computational link between low- and high-level visual representations. While the detailed nature of mid-level representations in the brain is not yet fully understood, past work has suggested that a texture statistics model (P-S model; Portilla & Simoncelli, 2000) is a candidate for predicting neural responses in areas V1-V4 as well as human behavioral data. However, it is not currently known how well this model accounts for the responses of higher visual cortex regions to natural scene images. To examine this, we constructed single voxel encoding models based on P-S statistics and fit the models to human fMRI data from the Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2021). We demonstrate that the texture statistics encoding model can predict the held-out responses of individual voxels in early retinotopic areas as well as higher-level category-selective areas. The ability of the model to reliably predict signal in higher visual cortex voxels suggests that the representation of texture statistics features is widespread throughout the brain, potentially playing a role in higher-order processes like object recognition. Furthermore, we use variance partitioning analyses to identify which features are most uniquely predictive of brain responses, and show that the contributions of higher-order texture features to model accuracy increases from early areas to higher areas on the ventral and lateral surface of the brain. These results provide a key step forward in characterizing how mid-level feature representations emerge hierarchically across the visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced Thalamic Excitation to Motor Cortical Pyramidal Tract Neurons in a Mouse Model of Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons causes a reduced motor output from the primary motor cortex (M1), underlying the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). However, cellular and circuitry mechanisms of M1 dysfunction in PD remain undefined. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we found that DA degeneration induces cell-subtype- and inputs-specific reduction of thalamic excitation to M1 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Physiological and anatomical analyses suggest that DA degeneration induces a loss of thalamocortical synapses to M1 PT neurons, resulting in an impaired thalamic driving of their activities. Moreover, we showed that the decreased thalamocortical connectivity are mediated by an excessive activation of NMDA receptors of M1 PT neurons. Further, the decreased thalamocortical transmission in parkinsonism can be rescued by chemogenetically suppressing basal ganglia outputs. Together, our data suggest that the reduced motor cortical outputs in parkinsonism are not only an immediate consequence of basal ganglia inhibition but also involves specific local circuitry adaptations within M1. This study reveals novel insight in the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor deficits.

                Despite many successful preclinical treatment studies to improve neurocognition in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (DS), translation to humans has failed. This raises critical questions about the appropriateness of the Ts65Dn mouse as the gold standard for DS research given that it carries, in addition to Mmu16 orthologous genes, triplication of 50 Mmu17 non-orthologous genes that might contribute to the observed brain and behavioral phenotypes. We used the novel Ts66Yah mouse that carries both an extra mini chromosome and the identical segmental Mmu16 trisomy as Ts65Dn, but in which the Mmu17 non-orthologous region was removed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We demonstrate that the Ts65Dn exhibits a more severe phenotype throughout the lifespan compared to the Ts66Yah mouse. Several Mmu17 non-orthologous genes were uniquely overexpressed in Ts65Dn embryonic forebrain; this produced major differences in dysregulated genes and pathways. Despite these genome-wide differences, the primary Mmu16 trisomic effects were highly conserved in both models, resulting in several commonly dysregulated disomic genes and pathways. During the neonatal period, delays in motor development, communication and olfactory spatial memory were observed in both Ts66Yah and Ts65Dn pups but were more pronounced in Ts65Dn. Adult Ts66Yah mice showed working memory deficits and sex-specific effects in exploratory behavior and spatial hippocampal memory, while long-term memory was preserved. Like the neonates, adult Ts66Yah mice exhibited fewer and milder behavioral deficits when compared to Ts65Dn mice. Our findings suggest that trisomy of the non-orthologous Mmu17 genes significantly contributes to the phenotype of the Ts65Dn mouse and may be one major reason why preclinical trials that used this model have unsuccessfully translated to human therapies.

                Extracting common patterns of neural circuit computations in autism spectrum and pinning them as a cause of specific core traits of autism is the first step towards identifying cell- and circuit-level targets for effective clinical intervention. Studies in human subjects with autism have identified functional links and common anatomical substrates between core restricted behavioral repertoire, cognitive rigidity, and over-stability of visual percepts during visual rivalry. To be able to study these processes with single-cell precision and exhaustive neuronal population coverage, we developed the visual bi-stable perception task for mice. Our task is based on plaid patterns consisting of two transparent gratings drifting at an angle of 120 degrees relative to each other. This results in spontaneous reversals of the perception between local component motion (motion of the plaid perceived as two separate moving grating components) and integrated global pattern motion (motion of the plaid perceived as a fused moving texture). This robust paradigm does not depend on the explicit report of the mouse, as the direction of the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN, rapid eye movements driven by either pattern or component motion) is used to infer the dominant percept. Using this paradigm, we found that the rate of perceptual reversals between global and local motion interpretations of the stimulus is reduced in MECP2 duplication mouse model of autism. Moreover, the stability of local motion percepts is greatly increased in MECP2 duplication mice at the expense of global motion percepts. Thus, our model reproduces a subclass of core features in human autism (reduced rate of visual rivalry and atypical perception of visual motion). This further offers a well-controlled approach for dissecting neuronal circuits underlying these core features if combined with mesoscale 2-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal circuits.

                Altered brain network activity and the resulting hypersynchrony are important for the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Treatments that reduce epileptiform discharges (EDs) or network hyperactivity improve cognition in AD models and humans. We first show that ketogenic diet, but not fasting, rapidly and persistently reduced EDs in the hAPPJ20 Alzheimer's mouse model over timescales of hours to months. Then, to identify the specific mechanism of the pleiotropic ketogenic diet, we developed small molecule ketone esters to deliver ketone bodies pharmacologically. Two ketone esters recapitulate ED suppression without other dietary manipulation, over time scales of minutes to one week. This small molecule rescue was associated with reduced low-frequency oscillatory activity similar to the recently reported mechanism of an NMDA receptor modulator molecule in this model. Long-term KD resulted in cognitive improvement and in a sex-stratified analysis also improved survival in the more severely affected hAPPJ20 males. Agents that deliver ketone bodies via small molecules or act on downstream targets may hold therapeutic promise in AD through the mechanism of improved network function and reduced epileptiform activity.

                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, heterogenous, and potentially serious psychiatric illness. Diverse brain cell types have been implicated in MDD etiology. Significant sexual differences exist in MDD clinical presentation and outcome, and recent evidence suggests different molecular bases for male and female MDD. We evaluated over 160,000 nuclei from 71 female and male donors, leveraging new and pre-existing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Cell type specific transcriptome-wide threshold-free MDD-associated gene expression patterns were similar between the sexes, but significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) diverged. Among 7 broad cell types and 41 clusters evaluated, microglia and parvalbumin interneurons contributed the most DEGs in females, while deep layer excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors were the major contributors in males. Further, the Mic1 cluster with 38% of female DEGs and the ExN10_L46 cluster with 53% of male DEGs, stood out in the meta-analysis of both sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia are involved in regulating histamine dependent and non-dependent itch transmissions with distinguished signal pathways</a></h4>

              
                Although itch and pain have many similarities, they are completely different in perceptual experience and behavioral response. In recent years, we have a deep understanding of the neural pathways of itch sensation transmission. However, there are few reports on the role of non-neuronal cells in itch. Microglia are known to play a key role in chronic neuropathic pain and acute inflammatory pain. It is still unknown whether microglia are also involved in regulating the transmission of itch sensation. In the present study, we used several kinds of transgenic mice to specifically deplete CX3CR1+ central microglia and peripheral macrophages together (whole depletion), or selectively deplete central microglia only (central depletion). We observed that the acute itch responses to histamine, compound 48/80 and chloroquine were all significantly reduced in mice with either whole or central depletion. Spinal c-fos mRNA assay and further studies revealed that the histamine dependent primary itch signal transmission from DRG to spinal npr1- and sst-positive neurons relied on microglia activation through CX3CL1-CX3CR1 pathway, but CQ elicited itch transmission did not require this pathway. Our results indicated that central microglia were involved in multiple types of acute chemical itch transmission, while the underlying mechanisms for histamine dependent and non-dependent itch transmission were different that the former required the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signal pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overlapping Neural Representations for Dynamic Visual Imagery and Stationary Storage in Spatial Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Representations in working memory need to be flexibly transformed to adapt to our dynamic environment and variable task demands. Recent work has demonstrated that activity in the alpha frequency band enables precise decoding of visual information during both perception and sustained storage in working memory. Extant work, however, has focused exclusively on the representation of static visual images. Here we used EEG recordings to examine whether alpha-band activity supports the dynamic transformation of representations in spatial working memory using an imagery task that required the active shifting of a stored position to a new position. In line with recent findings, a common format of alpha-band activity precisely tracked both the initial position stored in working memory as well as the transformed position, with the latter emerging approximately 800-1200 ms following an auditory cue to rotate to a new position. Moreover, the time course of this transformation of alpha activity predicted between-subject differences in manual reaction time to indicate the new position (Experiment 1), as well as within-subject variations in saccade latency in a speeded version of the task (Experiment 2). Finally, cross-training analyses revealed robust generalization of alpha-band reconstruction of working memory contents before and after mental transformation. These findings demonstrate that alpha activity tracks dynamic transformations of representations in spatial working memory, and that the format of this activity is preserved across the initial and transformed memory representations. These findings highlight a new approach for measuring voluntary shifts in online memory representations and show common representational formats during dynamic mental imagery and the maintenance of static representations in working memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurophysiological basis of hemodynamic responses in the developing human brain before the time of normal birth</a></h4>

              
                Neurovascular coupling that links neural activity to localized increases in blood flow is essential both for brain function and to prevent tissue injury. In the healthy human brain, this underlies an association between the duration of EEG microstates, which represent coordinated and metastable activation of neuronal ensembles, and increases in hemodynamic activity. However, in early human life it is not clear whether neurovascular coupling is functional as the underlying physiological mechanisms may be too immature to effectively support it. Here, we combined MRI compatible robotics with simultaneous EEG and fMRI data acquisition in 13 preterm infants to assess whether the relationship between neural activity and hemodynamic responses is present in this critical period of early life. Passive sensorimotor stimulation elicited both a distinct sequence of four EEG microstates and a significant rise in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal in the left primary sensorimotor cortex. Furthermore, EEG microstate duration was significantly related to BOLD response amplitude. These results suggest that effective neurovascular coupling is present in the human brain even before the normal time of birth and reveal a complex relationship between EEG and fMRI signals underpinned by patterns of activity across distinct neural ensembles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A linear discriminant analysis model of imbalanced associative learning in the mushroom body compartment</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to their environments, animals learn associations between sensory stimuli and unconditioned stimuli. In invertebrates, olfactory associative learning primarily occurs in the mushroom body, which is segregated into separate compartments. Within each compartment, Kenyon cells (KCs) encoding sparse odor representations project onto mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) whose outputs guide behavior. Associated with each compartment is a dopamine neuron (DAN) that modulates plasticity of the KC-MBON synapses within the compartment. Interestingly, DAN-induced plasticity of the KC-MBON synapse is imbalanced in the sense that it only weakens the synapse and is temporally sparse. We propose a normative mechanistic model of the MBON as a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier that predicts the presence of an unconditioned stimulus (class identity) given a KC odor representation (feature vector). Starting from a principled LDA objective function and under the assumption of temporally sparse DAN activity, we derive an online algorithm which maps onto the mushroom body compartment. Our model accounts for the imbalanced learning at the KC-MBON synapse and makes testable predictions that provide clear contrasts with existing models.
