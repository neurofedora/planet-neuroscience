              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03504">Immersion for AI: Immersive Learning with Artificial Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reflects upon what Immersion can mean from the perspective of an Artificial Intelligence (AI). Applying the lens of immersive learning theory, it seeks to understand whether this new perspective supports ways for AI participation in cognitive ecologies. By treating AI as a participant rather than a tool, it explores what other participants (humans and other AIs) need to consider in environments where AI can meaningfully engage and contribute to the cognitive ecology, and what the implications are for designing such learning environments. Drawing from the three conceptual dimensions of immersion - System, Narrative, and Agency - this work reinterprets AIs in immersive learning contexts. It outlines practical implications for designing learning environments where AIs are surrounded by external digital services, can interpret a narrative of origins, changes, and structural developments in data, and dynamically respond, making operational and tactical decisions that shape human-AI collaboration. Finally, this work suggests how these insights might influence the future of AI training, proposing that immersive learning theory can inform the development of AIs capable of evolving beyond static models. This paper paves the way for understanding AI as an immersive learner and participant in evolving human-AI cognitive ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03508">Elucidation of the Concept of Consciousness from the Theory of Non-Human Communication Agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on elucidating the concept of consciousness from a relational and post-phenomenological theory of non-human communication agents (ANHC). Specifically, we explore the contributions of Thomas Metzinger s Self Model Theory, Katherine Hayles conceptualizations of non-conscious cognitive processes centered on knowledge processing phenomena shared between biological and technical systems and Lenore and Manuel Blum s theoretical perspective on computation, which defines consciousness as an emergent phenomenon of complex computational systems, arising from the appropriate organization of their inorganic materiality. Building on interactions with non-human cognitive agents, among other factors, the explainability of sociotechnical systems challenges the humanistic common sense of modern philosophy and science. This critical integration of various approaches ultimately questions other concepts associated with consciousness, such as autonomy, freedom, and mutual responsibility. The aim is to contribute to a necessary discussion for designing new frameworks of understanding that pave the way toward an ethical and pragmatic approach to addressing contemporary challenges in the design, regulation, and interaction with ANHC. Such frameworks, in turn, enable a more inclusive and relational understanding of agency in an interconnected world.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065">Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.

                arXiv:2112.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-life decisions involve both perceptual processes and weighing the consequences of different actions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual decisions have typically been examined separately from those underlying economic decisions. Here, we trained rats to make choices informed by both perceptual and value cues on a trial-by-trial basis. As in typical perceptual tasks, subjects were rewarded for correctly categorizing a tone relative to a learned threshold. To add an economic component, a light indicated, on each trial, whether correct responses to one side gave higher rewards than correct responses to the other side. As such, on trials with some perceptual uncertainty, it could be worthwhile to choose the unlikely option, if it had higher expected value. We found that, despite subjects sensitivity to the frequency of the cue and the reward sizes, their behavior was not optimal: subjects tended to shift their choices in a stimulus-independent way following light flashes. Moreover, subjects tended to under-shift, which could be interpreted as being over-confident in their perceptual beliefs or as being risk-averse.

                arXiv:2406.16788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The on-off phenomena of opponent colors in center-surround may be the best-known facts of retinal processing of information. Apparently, however, no explicit model has been proposed that shows how neurons can be connected to produce the center-surround phenomena. Here it is shown that a previous simple model of color vision can produce these phenomena, including the detection of edge orientation and motion famously discovered by Hubel and Wiesel. The model was previously shown to produce major phenomena central to color vision, including mutually exclusive opponent colors.
  Although the opponencies of mutually exclusive colors and center-surround involve the same color pairs, red-green and blue-yellow, the model produces them by two different mechanisms. Perceptions of two colors are mutually exclusive because only one cone type can have the most, or least, absorption of photons. Two colors have the on-off opponency of center-surround because they have the same network designs up to the ganglion cells, with the inputs reversed there. On-off opponencies with different colors are possible, but natural selection evidently did not choose them.

Abstract: "Intrinsic motivation" refers to the capacity for intelligent systems to be motivated endogenously, i.e. by features of agential architecture itself rather than by learned associations between action and reward. This paper views active inference, empowerment, and other formal accounts of intrinsic motivation as variations on the theme of constrained maximum entropy inference, providing a general perspective on intrinsic motivation complementary to existing frameworks. The connection between free energy and empowerment noted in previous literature is further explored, and it is argued that the maximum-occupancy approach in practice incorporates an implicit model-evidence constraint.

                arXiv:2410.13872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.

                arXiv:2502.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many competitive clustering pipelines have a multi-modal design, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or other text encoders, and text-image pairs, which are often unavailable in real-world downstream applications. Additionally, such frameworks are generally complicated to train and require substantial computational resources, making widespread adoption challenging. In this work, we show that in deep clustering, competitive performance with more complex state-of-the-art methods can be achieved using a text-free and highly simplified training pipeline. In particular, our approach, Simple Clustering via Pre-trained models (SCP), trains only a small cluster head while leveraging pre-trained vision model feature representations and positive data pairs. Experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, STL-10, ImageNet-10, and ImageNet-Dogs, demonstrate that SCP achieves highly competitive performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result explaining why, at least under ideal conditions, additional text-based embeddings may not be necessary to achieve strong clustering performance in vision.

                arXiv:2305.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Constrained Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) depends on their ability to reach the different feasible regions during evolution, by exploiting the information present in infeasible solutions, in addition to optimizing the several conflicting objectives. Over the years, researchers have proposed several CMOEAs to handle Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs). However, most of the proposed CMOEAs with scalable performance are too complex because they are either multi-staged or multi-population-based algorithms. Consequently, to ensure the simplicity of CMOEAs, researchers have proposed different fitness-assignment-based CMOEAs by combining different fitness-assignment-based methods used to solve unconstrained multi-objective problems with information regarding the feasibility of each solution. The main performance drawback of such methods is that it is difficult to design a fitness assignment method that can account for constraint violation in addition to convergence and diversity. Hence in this paper, we propose an effective single-population fitness assignment-based CMOEA referred to as IcSDE+ that can explore different feasible regions in the search space. IcSDE+ is a fitness assignment-based algorithm, that is an efficient fusion of constraint violation (c), Shift-based Density Estimation (SDE), and sum of objectives (+). The performance of IcSDE+ is favorably compared against 9 state-of-the-art CMOEAs on 6 different benchmark suites with diverse characteristics.

                arXiv:2405.14339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of renewable energies strengthens decarbonization strategies. To integrate volatile renewable sources, energy systems require grid expansion, storage capabilities, or flexible consumption. This study focuses on industries that adapt production to real-time energy markets, offering flexible consumption to the grid. Flexible production considers not only traditional goals like minimizing production time, but also minimizing energy costs and emissions, thereby enhancing the sustainability of businesses. However, existing research focuses on single goals, neglects the combination of makespan, energy costs, and emissions, or assumes constant or periodic tariffs instead of a dynamic energy market. We present a novel memetic NSGA-III to minimize makespan, energy cost, and emissions, integrating real energy market data, and allowing manufacturers to adapt energy consumption to current grid conditions. Evaluating it with benchmark instances from literature and real energy market data, we explore the trade-offs between objectives, showcasing potential savings in energy costs and emissions on estimated Pareto fronts.

                arXiv:2308.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization has been a cornerstone of machine learning enabling the vast advances of AI development over the past decades. However, since this type of optimization requires differentiation, it reduces flexibility in the choice of model and objective. With recent evidence of the benefits of non-differentiable (e.g. neuromorphic) architectures over classical models, such constraints can become limiting in the future. We present Layer-wise Feedback Propagation (LFP), a novel training principle for neural network-like predictors utilizing methods from the domain of explainability to decompose a reward to individual neurons based on their respective contributions to solving a given task without imposing any differentiability requirements. Leveraging these neuron-wise rewards, our method then implements a greedy approach reinforcing helpful parts of the network and weakening harmful ones. While having comparable computational complexity to gradient descent, LFP offers the advantage that it obtains sparse models due to an implicit weight scaling. We establish the convergence of LFP theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness on various models and datasets. We further investigate two applications for LFP: Firstly, neural network pruning, and secondly, the optimization of neuromorphic architectures such as Heaviside step function activated Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). In the first setting, LFP naturally generates sparse models that are easily prunable and thus efficiently encode and compute information. In the second setting, LFP achieves comparable performance to surrogate gradient descent, but provides approximation-free training, which eases the implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Consequently, LFP combines efficiency in terms of computation and representation with flexibility w.r.t. model architecture and objective function. Our code is available.

                arXiv:2405.15429v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, being TDL models, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias. Our implementation of ETNNs can be found at https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/topological-equivariant-networks.

                arXiv:2405.16563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An inherent challenge in computing fully-explicit generalization bounds for transformers involves obtaining covering number estimates for the given transformer class $T$. Crude estimates rely on a uniform upper bound on the local-Lipschitz constants of transformers in $T$, and finer estimates require an analysis of their higher-order partial derivatives. Unfortunately, these precise higher-order derivative estimates for (realistic) transformer models are not currently available in the literature as they are combinatorially delicate due to the intricate compositional structure of transformer blocks.
  This paper fills this gap by precisely estimating all the higher-order derivatives of all orders for the transformer model. We consider realistic transformers with multiple (non-linearized) attention heads per block and layer normalization. We obtain fully-explicit estimates of all constants in terms of the number of attention heads, the depth and width of each transformer block, and the number of normalization layers. Further, we explicitly analyze the impact of various standard activation function choices (e.g. SWISH and GeLU). As an application, we obtain explicit pathwise generalization bounds for transformers on a single trajectory of an exponentially-ergodic Markov process valid at a fixed future time horizon. We conclude that real-world transformers can learn from $N$ (non-i.i.d.) samples of a single Markov process's trajectory at a rate of ${O}(\operatorname{polylog}(N)/\sqrt{N})$.

Currently, there are limited protocols for automated analysis of operant self-administration behavior. We provide a methodology to (1) obtain videos of training sessions via Raspberry Pi microcomputers or GoPro cameras, (2) obtain pose estimation data using the supervised machine learning software packages DeepLabCut (DLC) and Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) with a local high-performance computer cluster, (3) compare standard Med-PC lever response versus quadrant time data generated from pose estimation regions of interest, and (4) generate predictive behavioral classifiers. Overall, we demonstrate proof of concept to use pose estimation outputs from DLC to both generate quadrant time results and obtain behavioral classifiers from SimBA during operant training phases.</p>

                <p>A common impairment in aging is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), which manifests as impaired spectrotemporal processing. Presbycusis can be caused by a dysfunction of the peripheral and central auditory system, and these dysfunctions might differ between the sexes. To date, the circuit mechanisms in the central nervous system responsible for age-related auditory dysfunction remain mostly unknown. In the auditory cortex (ACtx), aging is accompanied by alteration in normal inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission and changes in excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) synapses, but which circuits are affected has been unclear. Here we investigated how auditory cortical microcircuits change with age and if sex-dependent differences existed. We performed laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer (L) 2/3 cells in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in young adult (2&ndash;3&nbsp;months) and aged (older than 18&nbsp;months) male and female CBA/CaJ mice which have normal peripheral hearing. We found that L2/3 cells in aged male animals display functional hypoconnectivity of inhibitory circuits originating from L2/3 and L4. Compared with cells from young adult mice, cells from aged male mice have weaker excitatory connections from L2/3. We also observed an increased diversity of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. These results suggest a sex-specific reduction and diversification in excitatory and inhibitory intralaminar cortical circuits in aged mice compared with young adult animals. We speculate that these unbalanced changes in cortical circuits contribute to the functional manifestations of age-related hearing loss in both males and females.</p>

                Abstract Background Nigella sativa L., known as black cumin, is thought to possess anti-inflammatory properties that may help alleviate related conditions. This study examined the effects of black cumin extract on levels of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), both inflammatory markers. Methods The experimental design included a control group used solely for post-testing. Five groups of Wistar rats were studied: a negative control group (N), a dyslipidemia group as a positive control (P), a dyslipidemia group given black cumin (P1), a dyslipidemia group treated with atorvastatin (P2), and a dyslipidemia group receiving both atorvastatin and black cumin (P3).IL-1β and TNF-α levels were measured using ELISA, and statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA followed by the Duncan test. Results After treatment, the average IL-1β levels were 38.26 pg/mL (N), 102.16 pg/mL (P), 57.05 pg/mL (P1), 29.16 pg/mL (P2), and 54.06 pg/mL (P3). The Duncan test indicated no significant differences in IL-1β levels among groups N, P2, and P3 (p>0.05), while group P exhibited the highest IL-1β levels, significantly different from the others. For TNF-α, average levels post-treatment were 30.42 pg/mL (N), 22.02 pg/mL (P), 27.25 pg/mL (P1), 16.33 pg/mL (P2), and 13.29 pg/mL (P3). The Duncan test showed that group P3 had the lowest TNF-α levels, which were not significantly different from P2 (p>0.05) but significantly different from groups P, P1, and N (p<0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, black cumin extract effectively reduces IL-1β levels in high-fat diet rat models, while the combination of atorvastatin and black cumin extract yields the most significant reduction in TNF-α levels.

                Background Migration is a social determinant of health, and migrants often face health inequalities compared to host populations. Migrants are underrepresented in health research in many European countries, including Belgium, which is concerning. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a comprehensive framework aimed at guiding research on migration and health within the WHO European Region. This initiative supports evidence-based policymaking among European member states by providing a foundational structure for examining various strategies and methodologies. The framework serves as a catalyst for discussion and critical analysis, contributing to the formulation of a global research agenda on migration and health under WHO’s leadership. Additionally, it outlines key research priorities and offers strategic recommendations to enhance the understanding and response to health issues related to migration. One of these recommendations calls on researchers to “maximise the use of existing data from research and routinely collected data in health information systems”. Objective The overarching aim of our Datahub initiative is to map available sources of datasets about access to and use of medicines among migrant populations, and test if and under which conditions they can be used in research, by taking the case of Flanders, Belgium. Methods This initiative will involve conducting a focused review to map datasets used for reporting access to and use of medicines among migrants, followed by a qualitative study with key informants; a structured analysis of ethical and legal challenges to be addressed when using the datasets we identified for research; and content description and evaluation of the different identified datasets. Results We assert that the results of our initiative will help presenting the diverse sources of data about medicines access or use among migrant populations. They will be also used to provide recommendations about enhancing the possibilities of retrieving, and using data, including recommendations for (legal, ethical, methodological) risk mitigation for retrieving and using these data.

                Background Hormonal changes in pregnancy and their induced effect on periodontal health are well documented. The present study is aimed at the potential repercussions of multiple pregnancies on periodontal health. Materials and methods Our study utilized data from key sections of the NHANES. All the pertaining and relevant data for the study is collected. Our exposure variable was the number of pregnancies, and the outcome variable was periodontal disease. The number of pregnancies is classified as one, two, three, four, or more. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, poverty/income ratio, marital status, and other variables. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to assess the impact of multiple pregnancies on periodontal disease. Result The crude and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that none of the variables were significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis. In univariate analysis, patients with one or two pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing periodontitis (OR 1.154, 95% CI 0.748-1.779), (OR 1.464, 95% CI 0.864-2.483) respectively. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Within the limitation of the study, there is no significant relationship between parity and the prevalence of periodontitis, the longitudinal study may be warranted to delve deeper into any potential associations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-951/v2?src=rss">The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone posts: a systematic review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Various physical and chemical modification techniques, including acid etching (e.g., 98% sulfuric acid), sandblasting with alumina oxide (Al₂O₃), plasma treatment, laser irradiation, silanization, and air abrasion with silica-coated particles, have been proposed to enhance PEEK’s bonding performance. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength.

                Background Recent studies have established that Medicinal Marijuana (MM) is beneficial in the treatment of spasms, sleep, and pain in adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms. However, MM has rarely been used for the treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) complications in adults. The aim of this literature review was to explore MM interventions globally, with a focus on identifying the best practice with MM for the treatment of complications of CP. Methods A literature search was performed using keywords and synonyms related to MM treatment and CP complications. Inclusions and exclusions were scoped to scholarly peer reviewed academic literature published 2019 to 2021 located in the Deakin Library collection. A screening process confirmed criteria adherence and identified additional papers in referencing. The papers were appraised and evaluated to ensure selections do not have perceived or actual bias. Results From 409 publications, 27 papers were selected for review because they investigated the benefits of MM treatment for patients with sleep, pain, and spasm complications. There was no literature found on the use of MM for adults with CP. Discussion Recent research has demonstrated that with an informed understanding of MM treatment adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms can use MM to manage sleep disruption and improve relaxation. Therefore, there are potential benefits for the use of MM in treating spasticity, pain, sleep and improvement of quality of life, and social and emotional wellbeing in adult patients with CP. No funding was sort or provided for this review and the results are specific to adults with CP, so they are not to be generalized to other populations.

                Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an uncommon nosocomial pathogen that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis in neonates and in immunocompromised individuals. It exhibits resistance to many commonly employed first-line antibiotics used to treat gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we present three cases of late-onset sepsis with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in high-risk neonates. Case 1 was a one-day-old preterm low-birth-weight infant who presented with respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. The patient was intubated and administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. Blood culture grew Candida krusei, hence Amphotericin B was initiated. Repeat blood culture on day 27 showed gram-negative bacilli, identified as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica by MALDI-TOF . Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, but sensitivity to Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Minocycline. IV Vancomycin was administered, which resulted in clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Case 2 was an eleven-day-old preterm, low-birth-weight baby who presented with fever. Initial investigations revealed normal complete blood counts (CBC) parameters and elevated CRP levels. Blood and CSF cultures isolated Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a similar AST pattern. Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was initiated with clinical improvement and negative follow-up blood cultures. Case 3 was a one-day-old preterm baby, appropriate-to-gestational age, presenting with respiratory distress syndrome. The infant was intubated and started on inotropic support and intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures on day 4 showed Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Vancomycin was started. Follow-up cultures on days 6 and 14 grew Acinetobacter baumannii. A combination of Levofloxacin and Colistin was added, and blood cultures were negative after seven days, with clinical improvement. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), leading to outbreaks. Clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of E. meningoseptica for gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis and meningitis in high-risk patients. Recent technological advances have enabled accurate speciation to guide therapy and reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

                Background Multiplayer Virtual Reality-Based Simulations (MPVR-based simulations) with immersive 3D environments have become an important tool in interprofessional education (IPE). However, instruments to measure interprofessional socialization in MPVR-based education are limited. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) is a useful tool for evaluating interprofessional socialization. This pilot study aimed to adapt and validate the ISVS-24 for use in interprofessional MPVR-based simulations settings. Methods Seventy-two participants, including anesthesiology residents (at novice, junior, and senior levels), general physicians, and nurses, were recruited voluntarily. The ISVS-24 was cross-culturally adapted and reviewed by experts for content validity in the MPVR simulation context. Participants completed the adapted ISVS after undergoing an interprofessional MPVR-based simulation. Structural validity was assessed using factorial analysis through principal component analysis. Content validity was measured using the mean content validity index (CVI). Consistency validity was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test indicated sampling adequacy (0.885), and Bartlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ2(42) = 472.725, p < 0.05). A three-section structure was confirmed. The mean CVI was 0.815, with 21 valid items (Aiken’s V ≥ 0.5). Among the 72 respondents, 40 were female (55.6%) and 32 were male (44.4%); 26 were anesthesiology residents (36.1%), 23 were general physicians (31.9%), and 23 were nurses (31.9%). The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.959. PCC for all items exceeded the r table value (> 0.232) with p < 0.05, showing significant item relationships. Conclusions The adapted version of ISVS for MPVR simulation-based education has good validity and reliability to assess interprofessional socialization in an MPVR-based simulation setting.

                Objective Toluene is the most abundant lipophilic aromatic compound in our environment. Exposure to toluene through inhalation is toxic to the cardiovascular system due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger oxidative stress. This study aims to examine the response of coronary arteries to toluene inhalation exposure based on the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in coronary arteries, and levels of CYP2E1 with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) in the serum. Methods This was a true experimental study on Wistar rats with a post-test control group design. In total, 36 Wistar rats were divided into five experimental (X1–X5) and one control group. The experimental groups were exposed to 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, and 25.6 mL of toluene, respectively. All groups, except control, received inhalation exposure for 14 d (6 h/d). Results In Wistar rats, toluene exposure significantly reduced the expression of SOD and CAT enzymes while it increased the expression of MDA and VCAM-1 in the coronary artery. Serum levels of CYP2E1 and Ox-LDL were unaffected. Conclusion Acute inhalation exposure to toluene significantly decreased SOD and CAT expression with increased MDA and VCAM-1 expression in coronary arteries. Other findings suggest that decreased CAT expression leads to increased VCAM-1 expression in the coronary artery.

                In 2009 a review of the state of child and adolescent physical and mental health care in the United States, appeared hopeful with the possibility of addressing the unmet health needs of our nation’s children in schools (Manning, 2009). Major legislation and sweeping strides for addressing the affordability of health care in the United States with The Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was codified into law and signed by President Obama, opening the possibility that the unmet physical and mental health needs of America’s youth may be reduced through the availability and affordability of health insurance for everyone (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). Over the past 15 years, the health and mental health of children and adolescents in the United States have undergone notable changes, reflecting both progress and persistent challenges. While public health initiatives and policy advancements have improved access to care and contributed to reductions in asthma prevalence and teen pregnancy rates, other areas continue to demonstrate systemic challenges. The rising incidence of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, depression, suicidality and ADHD highlight the ongoing need for comprehensive health interventions at the public health level. Additionally, disparities in healthcare access, particularly among rural and low-income populations, remain significant barriers to the overall well-being of children and youth. The shortage of primary care providers, gaps in insurance coverage and the increasing burden on school-based health clinics further complicate care accessibility. This paper examines the evolving trends in child and adolescent health, emphasizing the critical role of policy, environmental changes and healthcare innovations in shaping outcomes. After almost 15 years of this call to action and implementation of the ACA we have made strides towards healthy outcomes for children and youth, evidencing that transformative, systemic change is not only possible, but necessary to ensure the well-being of future generations.

                <p>by Rodrigo Osuna-Orozco, Edward Castillo, Kameron Decker Harris, Samantha R. Santacruz</p>

Large-scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience. Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the parsimonious representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.

                <p>by Dennis Khodasevich, Nina Holland, Lars van der Laan, Andres Cardenas</p>
Background <p>DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a window to characterize the impacts of environmental exposures and the biological aging process. Epigenetic clocks are often trained on DNAm using penalized regression of CpG sites, but recent evidence suggests potential benefits of training epigenetic predictors on principal components.</p> Methodology/findings <p>We developed a pipeline to simultaneously train three epigenetic predictors; a traditional CpG Clock, a PCA Clock, and a SuperLearner PCA Clock (SL PCA). We gathered publicly available DNAm datasets to generate i) a novel childhood epigenetic clock, ii) a reconstructed Hannum adult blood clock, and iii) as a proof of concept, a predictor of polybrominated biphenyl exposure using the three developmental methodologies. We used correlation coefficients and median absolute error to assess fit between predicted and observed measures, as well as agreement between duplicates. The SL PCA clocks improved fit with observed phenotypes relative to the PCA clocks or CpG clocks across several datasets. We found evidence for higher agreement between duplicate samples run on alternate DNAm arrays when using SL PCA clocks relative to traditional methods. Analyses examining associations between relevant exposures and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) produced more precise effect estimates when using predictions derived from SL PCA clocks.</p> Conclusions <p>We introduce a novel method for the development of DNAm-based predictors that combines the improved reliability conferred by training on principal components with advanced ensemble-based machine learning. Coupling SuperLearner with PCA in the predictor development process may be especially relevant for studies with longitudinal designs utilizing multiple array types, as well as for the development of predictors of more complex phenotypic traits.</p>

                <p>by Lucas D. Serdar, Jacob R. Egol, Brad Lackford, Brian D. Bennett, Guang Hu, Debra L. Silver</p>

RNA abundance is controlled by rates of synthesis and degradation. Although mis-regulation of RNA turnover is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, how it contributes to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we discover the landscape of RNA stability regulation in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that intact RNA decay machinery is essential for corticogenesis in vivo. We use SLAM-seq to measure RNA half-lives transcriptome-wide across multiple stages of cortical development. Leveraging these data, we discover <i>cis</i>-acting features associated with RNA stability and probe the relationship between RNA half-life and developmental expression changes. Notably, RNAs that are up-regulated across development tend to be more stable, while down-regulated RNAs are less stable. Using compound mouse genetics, we discover CNOT3, a core component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex linked to neurodevelopmental disease, is essential for cortical development. Conditional knockout of <i>Cnot3</i> in neural progenitors and their progeny in the developing mouse cortex leads to severe microcephaly due to altered cell fate and p53-dependent apoptosis. Finally, we define the molecular targets of CNOT3, revealing it controls expression of poorly expressed, non-optimal mRNAs in the cortex, including cell cycle-related transcripts. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned control of RNA turnover is crucial for brain development.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003028">The HCF101 protein is an important component of the cytosolic iron–sulfur synthesis pathway in Toxoplasma gondii</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eléa A. Renaud, Ambre J. M. Maupin, Laurence Berry, Julie Bals, Yann Bordat, Vincent Demolombe, Valérie Rofidal, Florence Vignols, Sébastien Besteiro</p>

Several key cellular functions depend on proteins harboring an iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cofactor. As these Fe-S proteins localize to several subcellular compartments, they require a dedicated machinery for cofactor assembly. For instance, in plants and algae there are Fe-S cluster synthesis pathways localizing to the cytosol, but also present in the mitochondrion and in the chloroplast, 2 organelles of endosymbiotic origin. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a plastid-bearing parasitic protist responsible for a pathology affecting humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates. We have characterized the <i>Toxoplasma</i> homolog of HCF101, originally identified in plants as a protein transferring Fe-S clusters to photosystem I subunits in the chloroplast. Contrarily to plants, we have shown that HCF101 does not localize to the plastid in parasites, but instead is an important component of the cytosolic Fe-S assembly (CIA) pathway which is vital for <i>Toxoplasma</i>. While the CIA pathway is widely conserved in eukaryotes, it is the first time the involvement of HCF101 in this pan-eukaryotic machinery is established. Moreover, as this protein is essential for parasite viability and absent from its mammalian hosts, it constitutes a novel and promising potential drug target.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003023">The exocytosis regulator complexin controls spontaneous synaptic vesicle release in a CAPS-dependent manner at C. elegans excitatory synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ya Wang, Chun Hin Chow, Yu Zhang, Mengjia Huang, Randa Higazy, Neeraja Ramakrishnan, Lili Chen, Xuhui Chen, Yixiang Deng, Sheng Wang, Cuntai Zhang, Cong Ma, Shuzo Sugita, Shangbang Gao</p>

The balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for coordinating motor behavior, yet the differential roles of exocytosis regulators in this balance are less understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of 2 conserved exocytosis regulators, complexin/CPX-1 and CAPS/UNC-31, in excitatory versus inhibitory synapses at <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. <i>cpx-1</i> null mutants exhibited a marked increase in spontaneous release specifically at excitatory synapses, alongside an unequal reduction in excitatory and inhibitory evoked release. A clamping-specific knockin mutant, <i>cpx-1(Δ12)</i>, which preserved evoked release, also showed a biased enhancement in excitatory spontaneous release. Conversely, the <i>unc-31</i> null mutation, while maintaining normal spontaneous release, displayed a more pronounced reduction in evoked release at excitatory synapses. Notably, we found that CPX-1’s clamping function is dependent on UNC-31 and is sensitive to <i>external Ca</i><sup>2+</sup>. Pull-down experiments confirmed that CAPS/UNC-31 does not directly interact with complexin, implying an indirect regulatory mechanism. Moreover, complexin regulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, which is also UNC-31 dependent. The unexpected role of CAPS/UNC-31 in the absence of CPX-1 clamping function may underpin the synaptic E/I balance and coordinated behavioral outputs in different species.

                <p>by Julie Y. Chen, Kyle M. Loh</p>

An important question is whether the placenta is a source of, or merely a niche for, blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells. A recent PLOS Biology study suggests that the placenta does not directly give rise to hematopoietic stem cells.

                Zhang et al. report that MAIT cells protect against sterile lung injury by promoting cDC1 accumulation, which limits tissue damage through a DNGR-1-dependent pathway. Analysis of human IPF data suggests that MAIT cells may potentially modulate fibrosis.

                Tolve et al. demonstrate that AP-2 stabilizes GRID2IP to regulate synaptic function in Purkinje cells. Loss of AP-2 disrupts synaptic connectivity, alters network activity, and impacts motor coordination. This study highlights the importance of AP-2 in cerebellar function and its implications for neurodegenerative disorders.

                Shen et al. documented that PRMT7 is a functional target of SCZ risk SNPs at 16q22.1. They further uncovered that PRMT7 dysregulation resulted in NPC function defects by impacting the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and neuronal function, potentially contributing to the risk of SCZ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86931">The Mycobacterium ulcerans toxin mycolactone causes destructive Sec61-dependent loss of the endothelial glycocalyx and vessel basement membrane to drive skin necrosis</a></h4>

              
                The drivers of tissue necrosis in <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> infection (Buruli ulcer disease) have historically been ascribed solely to the directly cytotoxic action of the diffusible exotoxin, mycolactone. However, its role in the clinically evident vascular component of disease aetiology remains poorly explained. We have now dissected mycolactone’s effects on human primary vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We show that mycolactone-induced changes in endothelial morphology, adhesion, migration, and permeability are dependent on its action at the Sec61 translocon. Unbiased quantitative proteomics identified a profound effect on proteoglycans, driven by rapid loss of type II transmembrane proteins of the Golgi, including enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, combined with a reduction in the core proteins themselves. Loss of the glycocalyx is likely to be of particular mechanistic importance, since knockdown of galactosyltransferase II (beta-1,3-galactotransferase 6; B3GALT6), the GAG linker-building enzyme, phenocopied the permeability and phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone. Additionally, mycolactone depleted many secreted basement membrane components and microvascular basement membranes were disrupted in vivo during <i>M. ulcerans</i> infection in the mouse model. Remarkably, exogenous addition of laminin-511 reduced endothelial cell rounding, restored cell attachment and reversed the defective migration caused by mycolactone. Hence supplementing mycolactone-depleted extracellular matrix may be a future therapeutic avenue, to improve wound healing rates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98158">Molecular determinants of Neu5Ac binding to a tripartite ATP independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i> -Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is a negatively charged nine-carbon amino sugar that is often the peripheral sugar in human cell-surface glycoconjugates. Some bacteria scavenge, import, and metabolize Neu5Ac or redeploy it on their cell surfaces for immune evasion. The import of Neu5Ac by many bacteria is mediated by tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters. We have previously reported the structures of SiaQM, a membrane-embedded component of the <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> TRAP transport system, (Currie et al., 2024). However, none of the published structures contain Neu5Ac bound to SiaQM. This information is critical for defining the transport mechanism and for further structure-activity relationship studies. Here, we report the structures of <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> SiaQM with and without Neu5Ac. Both structures are in an inward (cytoplasmic side) facing conformation. The Neu5Ac-bound structure reveals the interactions of Neu5Ac with the transporter and its relationship with the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites. Two of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites are similar to those described previously. We identify a third metal-binding site that is further away and buried in the elevator domain. Ser300 and Ser345 interact with the C1-carboxylate group of Neu5Ac. Proteoliposome-based transport assays showed that Ser300-Neu5Ac interaction is critical for transport, whereas Ser345 is dispensable. Neu5Ac primarily interacts with residues in the elevator domain of the protein, thereby supporting the elevator with an operator mechanism. The residues interacting with Neu5Ac are conserved, providing fundamental information required to design inhibitors against this class of proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92906">Akkermansia muciniphila identified as key strain to alleviate gut barrier injury through Wnt signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                As the largest mucosal surface, the gut has built a physical, chemical, microbial, and immune barrier to protect the body against pathogen invasion. The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) models infected with enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse, and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (<i>A. muciniphila</i>) and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> (<i>B. fragilis</i>) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in the AIMD mice model, which revealed that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>B. fragilis</i> relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of <i>A. muciniphila</i> was better than <i>B. fragilis</i>. We, therefore, identified whether <i>A. muciniphila</i> protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. <i>A. muciniphila</i> did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of <i>A. muciniphila</i> were reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in the AIMD model. <i>A. muciniph</i>ila was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

">How do egocentric boundary cells depend upon the coordinate system of environmental features?</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the retrosplenial (RSC) (Alexander et al., 2020a; LaChance and Hasselmo, 2024) and postrhinal cortex (POR) respond to environmental boundaries and configurations in egocentric coordinates relative to an animals current position. Neurons in these structures and adjacent structures also respond to spatial dimensions of self-motion such as running velocity (Carstensen et al., 2021; Robinson et al., 2024). Data and modeling suggest that these responses could be essential for guiding behaviors such as barrier avoidance and goal finding (Erdem and Hasselmo, 2012; 2014). However, these findings still leave the unanswered question: What are the features and what are the coordinate systems of these features that drive these egocentric neural responses? Here we present models of the potential circuit mechanisms generating egocentric responses in RSC. These can be generated based on coding of internal representations of barriers in head-centered coordinates of distance and angle that are transformed based on current running velocity for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. This hypothesis is compared with an alternate potentially complementary hypothesis that neurons in the same regions might respond to retinotopic position of features at the top, bottom or edges of walls as a precursor to head-centered coordinates. Alternate hypotheses include the forward scanning of trajectories (ray tracing) to test for collision with barriers, or the comparison of optic flow on different sides of the animal. These hypotheses generate complementary modeling predictions about how changes in environmental parameters could alter the neural responses of egocentric boundary cells that are presented here.

">Atypical plume-like events drive glutamate accumulation in metabolic stress conditions</a></h4>

              
                Neural glutamate homeostasis plays a key role in health and disease. In ischemic conditions, such as stroke, this homeostasis is severely disrupted since energy depletion and ion imbalances lead to more glutamate release and less uptake. We here used the fluorescent glutamate sensor SF iGluSnFR(A184V) to probe the effects of chemical ischemia on extracellular glutamate dynamics in situ, using organotypic slice cultures from mouse cortex. SF iGluSnFR imaging reported spontaneous glutamate release events, which indicate synchronous network activity, similar to calcium signals detected with GCaMP6f. In addition, glutamate imaging revealed local, asynchronous release events, which were atypically large and long-lasting and showed plume-like characteristics. Under baseline conditions plumes occurred with low frequency, were independent of network activity, and persisted in the presence of TTX. Plume induction was strongly favored by blocking glutamate uptake with TFB-TBOA, whereas blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) suppressed plumes. Upon inducing chemical ischemia plumes became more pronounced and overly abundant, which resulted in large-scale accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Similar plumes were recently also observed in models of cortical spreading depression and migraine. We therefore propose that plumes represent a more general phenomenon induced by glutamate uptake dysfunction, which may contribute to glutamate-related excitotoxicity in various neurodegenerative and neurological disorders.

">Novel neurofilament light (Nefl) E397K mouse models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E) present early and chronic axonal neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathy with an incidence of 1:2,500. CMT2 clinical symptoms include distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, toe and foot deformities, with some patients presenting with reduced nerve conduction velocity. Mutations in the neurofilament light chain (NEFL) gene result in a specific form of CMT2 disease, CMT2E. NEFL encodes the protein, NF-L, one of the core intermediate filament proteins that contribute to the maintenance and stability of the axonal cytoskeleton. To better understand the underlying biology of CMT2E disease and advance the development of therapeutics, we generated a Nefl+/E397K mouse model. While the Nefl+/E397K mutation is inherited in a dominant manner, we also characterized NeflE397K/E397K mice to determine whether disease onset, progression or severity would be impacted. Consistent with CMT2E, lifespan was not altered in these novel mouse models. A longitudinal electrophysiology study demonstrated significant in vivo functional abnormalities as early as P21 in distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and negative area. A significant reduction in the sciatic nerve axon area, diameter, and G-ratio was also present as early as P21. Evidence of axon sprouting was observed with disease progression. Through the twelve months measured, disease became more evident in all assessments. Collectively, these results demonstrate an early and robust in vivo electrophysiological phenotype and axonal pathology, making Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice ideal for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.

">Dose-dependent changes in global brain activity and functional connectivity following exposure to psilocybin: a BOLD MRI study in awake rats.</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a hallucinogen with complex neurobiological and behavioral effects. This is the first study to use MRI to follow functional changes in brain activity in response to 31 different doses of psilocybin in fully awake, drug naive rats. Female and male rats were given IP injections of vehicle or psilocybin in doses of 0.03 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg while fully awake during the imaging session. Changes in BOLD signal were recorded over a 20 min window. Data for resting state functional connectivity were collected approximately 35 min post injection All data were registered to rat 3D MRI atlas with 173 brain regions providing site-specific changes in global brain activity and changes in functional connectivity. Treatment with psilocybin resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in positive BOLD signal. The areas most affected by the acute presentation of psilocybin were the somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Females were significantly more sensitive to the 0.3 mg/kg dose of psilocybin than males. There was a significant dose-dependent global increase in functional connectivity, highlighted by hyperconnectivity to the cerebellum. Brain areas hypothesized to be involved in loss of sensory filtering and organization of sensory motor stimuli such as the claustrum and the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop were all affected by psilocybin in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, the general neuroanatomical circuitry associated with the psychedelic experience was affected but the direction of the BOLD signal and pattern of activity between neural networks was inconsistent with the human literature.

">Peri-somatic modulation of diffracted light and its variation with consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Existing noninvasive neurophysiological recording methods can acquire neuronal correlates of consciousness, but they do not differentiate between conscious and unconscious states mechanistically. Here we describe a method that detects a new physical effect of apparent neural origin in the peri-somatic space that might allow such differentiation. This effect is a slow decrease in the intensity of diffracted low power laser light emitted within a photoelectronic device placed close to the body of an awake subject. It is markedly attenuated by general anesthesia in mice and unconsciousness in patients. Its direction is reversed when the device is exposed to live invertebrates or to the decapitated head of a euthanized mouse. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized biophysical phenomenon that appears to be related to consciousness.

">Sex-biased zinc responses modulate ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and social defects in Cttnbp2 mutant mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by genetic mutations, dietary factors, and sex-specific mechanisms, yet the interplay of these factors remains elusive. Here, we investigate the sex-biased responses of mutant mice carrying an ASD-associated mutation in Cttnbp2 to dietary zinc supplementation using behavioral assays, proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, and puromycin pulse labeling to assess protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that zinc supplementation enhances ribosome biogenesis and increases the density and size of dendritic spines in male Cttnbp2 mutant mice, alleviating male-biased social deficits. Analyses of neuronal cultures further revealed that neurons, not astrocytes, respond to zinc to enhance protein synthesis. In contrast, female Cttnbp2 mutants exhibit resilience to differential zinc intake, even under zinc deprivation. Elevated mTOR phosphorylation and increased protein levels of translational initiation factors in female brains may provide a protective mechanism, reducing their sensitivity to zinc deficiency. Cttnbp2 mutations heighten male vulnerability to zinc deprivation, impairing social behaviors. These findings highlight zinc-regulated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis as critical mediators of sex-specific ASD phenotypes, offering new insights into dietary interventions.

">Loss of white matter tracts and persistent microglial activation in the chronic phase of ischemic stroke in female rats and the effect of miR-20a-3p treatment</a></h4>

              
                Our previous studies showed that intravenous injections of the small non-coding RNA mir-20a-3p is neuroprotective for stroke in the acute phase and attenuates long-term cognitive impairment in middle-aged female rats. In this study, we evaluated postmortem brain pathology at 100+d after stroke in a set of behaviorally characterized animals. This included Sham (no stroke) controls or stroke animals that received either mir20a-3p at 4h, 24h and 70d iv post stroke (MCAo+mir20a-3p) or a scrambled oligo (MCAo+Scr). Brain volumetric features were analyzed with T2 weighted and Diffusion Tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by histological analysis. Principal component analysis of Fractional Anisotropy (FA)-diffusion tensor MRI measures showed that MCAo+Scr and MCAo+mir20a-3p groups differed significantly in the volume of white matter but not gray matter. Weil myelin-stained sections confirmed decreased volume of the corpus callosum, internal capsule and the anterior commissure in the ischemic hemisphere of MCAo+Scr animals compared to the non-ischemic hemisphere, while sham and MCAo+Mir-20a-3p showed no hemispheric asymmetries. The MCAo+Scr group also exhibited asymmetry in hemisphere and lateral ventricle volumes, with ventricular enlargement in the ischemic hemisphere as compared to the non-ischemic hemisphere. The numbers of microglia were significantly elevated in white matter tracts in the MCAo+Scr group, with a trend towards increased myelin phagocytic microglia in these tracts. Regression analysis indicated that performance on an episodic memory test (novel object recognition test; NORT) was associated with decreased white matter volume and increased microglial numbers. These data support the hypothesis that stroke-induced cognitive impairment is accompanied by white matter attrition and persistent microglial activation and is consistent with reports that cognitive deterioration resulting from vascular diseases, such as stroke, is associated with secondary neurodegeneration in regions distal from the initial infarction.

">Population-level morphological analysis of paired CO2- and odor-sensing olfactory neurons in D. melanogaster via volume electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic morphology is a defining characteristic of neuronal subtypes. In Drosophila, heterotypic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing different receptors display diverse dendritic morphologies, but whether such diversity exists among homotypic ORNs remains unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy on cryofixed tissues, we analyzed the majority of CO2-sensing neurons (ab1C) and their odor-sensing neighbors (ab1D) in the D. melanogaster antenna. Surprisingly, ab1C neurons featured flattened, sheet-like dendrites, distinct from the cylindrical branches typical of odor-sensing neurons, and displayed remarkable diversity, ranging from plain sheets to tube-like structures that enclose several neighboring dendrites, forming dendrite-within-dendrite structures. Similarly, ab1D dendrites varied from simple, unbranched forms to numerously branched morphologies. These findings suggest that morphological heterogeneity is common even among homotypic ORNs, potentially expanding their functional adaptability and ranges of sensory physiological properties.

">Topological Analysis of Macaca mulatta's Cortical Structures Through the Lens of Poincare Duality</a></h4>

              
                Poincare duality from algebraic topology describes how shapes and spaces interrelate across different dimensions, linking structures of one scale to complementary structures at another. This suggests that densely packed neurons in certain brain areas may correspond to broader connectivity patterns, balancing local processing with global communication. Applying this framework to cortical histological images of Macaca mulatta, we analysed neuronal clustering, connectivity graphs and intensity distributions to identify self-dual structural patterns and reveal the contribution of local organization to large-scale network activity. Using image processing techniques such as contrast enhancement, edge detection and graph-theoretic modeling, we examined how dense neuron clusters correspond to functionally sparse regions and vice versa. We found that high-density neuronal zones form closed-loop topological structures that correspond to homology cycles, while sparser areas function as large-scale integrators, aligning with cohomology properties. Local connectivity hubs in neuron-dense regions support regional specialization, while large-scale, sparser areas, though less connected, facilitate global communication by acting as pathways for long-range integration. Graph-theoretic analysis of connectivity patterns confirmed a reciprocal relationship between clustering coefficients and global centrality. Statistical analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed conserved topological distributions across different cortical regions, supporting the hypothesis that cortical connectivity maintains structural invariance under local perturbations. These findings provide insights into the mathematical principles governing brain architecture, suggesting that topological methods can enhance our understanding of cortical function. Future research may extend these approaches to higher-dimensional embeddings, network theory in primate brains, functional neuroimaging, human disease modeling and artificial intelligence.

                There has been a long-term need for a low-cost, highly efficient, and high-fidelity epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) suitable for home-cage monitoring of small-animal models of epilepsy. We show an accessible, scalable, highly space and energy-efficient EMU capable of fulfilling chronic, continuous synchronized multiple animal monitoring jobs. Each rig within the EMU can provide 16-channel high-fidelity, DC-sensitive biopotential recordings, head acceleration monitoring, synchronized voltammetry applications, and video recording on one freely moving rat. We present the overall EMU architecture design and subsystem details in each recording rig. We demonstrate long-term continuous in vivo recordings of spontaneous seizure and seizure-associated spreading depolarization (SD) from freely moving rats prepared under the tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

">Neuro-behavioral impact of Tourette-related striatal disinhibition in rats</a></h4>

              
                Tourette syndrome has been linked to reduced GABAergic inhibition, so called neural disinhibition, in the dorsal striatum. Dorsal-striatal neural disinhibition in animal models, caused by local microinfusion of GABA-A-receptor antagonists, produces striatal local field potential (LFP) spike-wave discharges and tic-like movements resembling motor tics. Here, we characterized further the neuro-behavioral impact of striatal disinhibition, by unilateral picrotoxin infusion into the anterior dorsal striatum, in adult male Lister hooded rats. In vivo electrophysiology under anesthesia revealed enhanced neuronal burst firing in the striatum, alongside spike-wave LFP discharges. In freely moving rats, striatal picrotoxin reliably induced tic-like movements, which mainly involved lifting of the contralateral forelimb and concomitant rotational movements of head and torso, as well as occasional rotations of the whole body around its long axis. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response was not affected, but startle reactivity tended to be reduced. Both locomotor and non-ambulatory movements, measured in photo-beam cages, were increased. Our findings suggest that, apart from generating tic- like movements, dorsal striatal disinhibition may contribute to hyperactivity, which is often comorbid with Tourette syndrome. Enhanced striatal burst firing may be important for these behavioral effects. Our findings do not support that striatal disinhibition contributes to PPI disruption, which has been associated with Tourette syndrome and suggested to contribute to tic generation.

">Phenotypic and Functional Alterations in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell-Derived Microglia in a Primate Model of Chronic Alcohol Consumption</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia

">Cerebral blood perfusion across biological systems and the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Blood perfusion delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells, making it a fundamental feature of brain organization. How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1,305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows micro-architectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.

">Spatiotemporal Patterns Differentiate Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples from Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) are high-frequency oscillations critical for memory consolidation in mammals. Despite extensive characterization in rodents, their application as biomarkers to track and treat memory dysfunction in humans is limited by coarse spatial sampling, interference from interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and lack of consensus on human SPW-R localization and morphology. We demonstrate that mouse and human hippocampal ripples share spatial, spectral and temporal features, which are clearly distinct from IEDs. In 1024-channel hippocampal recordings from APP/PS1 mice, SPW-Rs were distinguishable from IEDs by their narrow localization to the CA1 pyramidal layer, narrowband frequency peaks, and multiple ripple cycles on the unfiltered local field potential. In epilepsy patients, ripples showed similar narrowband frequency peaks and visible ripple cycles in CA1 and the subiculum but were absent in the dentate gyrus. Conversely, IEDs showed a broad spatial extent and wide-band frequency power. We introduce a semi-automated, human ripple detection toolbox ('ripmap') selecting optimal detection channels and separating event waveforms by low-dimensional embedding. Our approach improves ripple detection accuracy, providing a firm foundation for future human memory research.

">Protein Synthesis Blockade Prevents Fear Memory Reactivation via Inhibition of Engram Synapse Strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Memory relies on ensembles of engram cells in the brain. While previous studies have established the existence of these cells, the relationship between cellular and synaptic activity remains unclear. To address this, we applied the dual e-GRASP technique in mice to examine synaptic connectivity between the ventral CA1 and the basal amygdala during memory formation. We found that contextual fear conditioning increased engram-to-engram synapse (engram synapse) density and induced structural potentiation, highlighting their importance in associative memory. Additionally, we investigated the role of protein synthesis in memory formation by inducing retrograde amnesia using anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Single anisomycin-injected mice (1xANI) showed impaired natural recall but still displayed fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation of engram cells. In contrast, mice that received four anisomycin injections over six hours (4xANI) showed significantly impaired natural recall and failed to exhibit fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation. This behavioural phenotype was correlated with synaptic changes as 1xANI mice exhibited no significant reduction in engram synapse density but had significantly smaller spine size while 4xANI mice showed both significant reduction in engram synapse density and spine size. Our result indicate that protein synthesis inhibition significantly changes engram synapse density and spine size which correlatively affect fear memory natural recall and artificial reactivation.

">Differentiating unirradiated mice from those exposed to conventional or FLASH radiotherapy using MRI</a></h4>

              
                Background and purpose: The FLASH effect expands the therapeutic ratio of tumor control to normal tissue toxicity observed after delivery of ultra-high (>100 Gy/s FLASH-RT) vs. conventional dose rate radiation (CONV-RT). In this first exploratory study, we assessed whether ex-vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) could reveal long-term differences after FLASH-RT and CONV-RT whole-brain irradiation. Materials and methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control (non-irradiated), conventional (CONV-RT 0.1 Gy/s), and ultra-high dose rates (FLASH-RT 1 pulse, 5.5 x 10^6 Gy/s), and received 10 Gy of whole-brain irradiation in a single fraction at 10 weeks of age. Mice were evaluated by Novel Object Recognition cognitive testing at 10 months post-irradiation and were sampled at 13 months post-irradiation. Ex-vivo brains were imaged with a 14.1 Tesla/26 cm magnet with a multimodal MRI protocol, including T2-weighted TurboRare (T2W) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Results: In accordance with previous results, cognitive tests indicated that animals receiving CONV-RT exhibited a decline in cognitive function, while FLASH-RT performed similarly to the controls. MRI showed decreased hippocampal mean intensity in the CONV-RT mice compared to controls but not in the FLASH-RT group. Comparing CONV-RT to control, we found significant changes in multiple whole-brain diffusion metrics, including the mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP) metrics. By contrast, no significant diffusion changes were found between the FLASH-RT and control groups. In an exploratory analysis compared to controls, regional diffusion metrics were primarily altered in the basal forebrain and the insular cortex after CONV-RT, and after FLASH-RT, a trend reduction was also observed. Conclusion: This study presents initial evidence that MRI can uncover clear changes in the brain after CONV-RT but not after FLASH-RT. The MRI results aligned with the observed cognitive protection after FLASH-RT, indicating the potential use of MRI to analyze the FLASH response.

">The effects of reliable social feedback on language learning: insights from EEG and pupillometry</a></h4>

              
                Language learning is often a social process, and social feedback may play a motivational role. We examined the neurophysiological correlates of word learning with feedback varying in reliability and social content. Participants associated novel auditory words with objects and received social (video clips) or symbolic (static images) feedback. In a forced-choice task, participants learned to associate novel auditory words with known objects and received feedback that was either Social Reliable (correct), Social Unreliable (random), or Symbolic Reliable (correct). Post-training behavioral performance was better for words learned with social and symbolic reliable feedback. Stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and late positive complex (LPC) ERP amplitudes, as well as pupil dilation, showed differences as a function of feedback reliability and social content. In the reliable conditions, before feedback, SPN amplitude grew as learning progressed, likely due to the expectation of receiving positive feedback. During feedback, LPC amplitude for positive feedback diminished as learning progressed but not for negative feedback, which was likely consistently used for context updating. These effects were not observed for unreliable feedback, probably because its value was not used for updating information. Pupillometry results corroborated these findings, showing greater dilation for negative vs positive feedback in reliable conditions. Finally, when feedback was social, processing was associated with more frontal activation and behavioral performance was closely correlated with both ERP and pupillometry results. Overall, our findings show differential processing of feedback depending on its informational and social content, advancing our understanding of how social and cognitive processes interact to shape word learning.

">Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling through Müller glia regulates neuroprotection and the accumulation of immune cells in the rodent retina</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Muller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. S1pr1 (encoding S1P receptor 1) and Sphk1 (encoding sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates S1pr1, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells and suppresses glial differentiation. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate pro-inflammatory NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG in damaged retinas. Conditional knock-out of NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG increases glial expression of S1pr1 but decreases levels of S1pr3 and Sphk1. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of S1pr1 in MG, but not Sphk1, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in acutely damaged retinas. cKO of S1pr1 is neuroprotective to ganglion cells, whereas cKO of Sphk1 is neuroprotective to amacrine cells in NMDA-damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 had protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P-signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway acts secondarily to restrict the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.

">The role of human intraparietal sulcus in evidence accumulation revealed by EEG and model-informed fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models propose that the repeated sampling of sensory information is a fundamental component of perceptual decision-making. Electroencephalographic investigations in humans have demonstrated motor-independent representations of evidence accumulation, but such observations have seldom been made in neuroimaging studies exploring the neuroanatomical origins of evidence accumulation. Here, we aimed to reveal the neuroanatomical locus of sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain by regressing an electrophysiological marker of evidence accumulation (centroparietal positivity, CPP) against changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during perceptual decision-making. Our cross-modal imaging approach revealed a cluster within left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), located within putative lateral intraparietal area (region hIP3), for which BOLD signals scaled in relation to the slope of the CPP. Furthermore, the drift rate parameter of a drift diffusion model parametrically modulated BOLD activity within an overlapping region of left IPS. In contrast, parametric modulation by reaction time revealed a distributed fronto-parietal network, demonstrating the utility of our approach for isolating a discrete neuroanatomical locus of evidence accumulation. Together, our findings provide strong support for intraparietal sulcus involvement in the accumulation of sensory evidence during human perceptual decision-making.

">Modular architecture confers robustness to damage and facilitates recovery in spiking neural networks modeling in vitro neurons</a></h4>

              
                Impaired brain function is restored following injury through dynamic processes that involve synaptic plasticity. This restoration is supported by the brains inherent modular organization, which promotes functional separation and redundancy. However, it remains unclear how the modular structure interacts with synaptic plasticity, most notably in the form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), to define the damage response and recovery efficiency. In this work, we numerically modeled the response and recovery to damage of a neuronal network in vitro bearing a modular structure. Consistent with the in vitro observations, the in silico numerical model effectively captured the decline and subsequent recovery of spontaneous activity following the injury. We revealed that the modular structure confers robustness to injury, minimizes the decrease in neuronal activity, and promotes recovery via STDP. Finally, using the reservoir computing framework, we show that information representation in the neuronal network improves with the recovery of synchronous activity. Our work provides an experimental-numerical platform for predicting recovery in damaged neuronal networks and may help developing effective models for brain injury.

">THE EFFECT OF SERTRALINE AND VOLUNTARY EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY ON LITTER CHARACTERISTICS AND POSTNATAL AFFECTIVE BEHAVIOUR IN RAT DAMS</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sertraline is the frontline pharmacotherapy for the treatment of depression and anxiety during pregnancy. However, there is little evidence regarding the effects of sertraline on maternal behaviour or the maternal brain. Furthermore, the efficacy of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment in pregnancy, such as exercise, are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of sertraline and exercise during pregnancy on maternal postnatal depressive-like, anxiety-like and associated behaviours, as well as litter characteristics, in a rat model of depression. We also investigated the effects of these treatments on the maternal brain, focusing initially on DNA methylation and glutamatergic markers, which have been implicated in depression. Method: Twenty-four female Wistar-Kyoto (WKY; strain that models depression and anxiety) rats were divided into three groups: 1. WKY-Sertraline; 2. WKY-Exercise, 3. WKY-Vehicle; Six female Wistar rats were included as controls. Rats were treated with sertraline (10mg/kg) or vehicle (33% propylene glycol) twice/day, from gestational day (GD) 1 to postnatal day (PN) 14. The WKY-Exercise group were provided access to a running wheel during pregnancy for 3 hours/day from GD1-18. Dam and litter characteristics, as well as pup ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs), were measured. Dams underwent behavioural testing at 5-weeks postnatal to assess depressive-, anxiety- and cognitive-like behaviours. Gene expression of DNA methylation markers (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a) and glutamate receptors (Grin1, Grin2a, Grin2b) were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), using RT-qPCR. Result: The WKY-Sertraline group gained 39% less weight in their first pregnancy week compared to all other groups (p<0.05) and produced smaller litters compared to Wistar controls (-43%; p=0.003) and WKY-Exercise (-38%; p=0.012), and WKY-Sertraline pups had slightly smaller brain weights (p=0.031 compared to WKY-Vehicle). The WKY-Exercise pups produced increased number of USVs at PN7 compared to WKY-Vehicle, with no treatment differences at PN14. The WKY strain however, did showed reduced average mean amplitude of calls and reduced average duration of calls at PN7 compared to WIS (p<0.01) and reduced number of calls at PN14 (p<0.01). Maternal sertraline treatment did not significantly affect dam behavioural measures, all maternal cortical gene expression. The WKY-Exercise group however showed reduced anxiety-like behaviours, spending more time in the open arms (620%; p=0.027) and less time in the closed arms (-22%; p=0.047) of the elevated plus maze (EPM) compared to WKY-Vehicle, and more time in the centre of the open field test (OFT) compared to WKY-Vehicle (132%; p=0.057). Furthermore, WKY-Exercise dams showed a 64% increase in Dnmt3a mRNA levels in the PFC compared to WKY-Vehicle (p=0.019). Conclusion: Voluntary exercise during pregnancy in the WKY rat model, reduced postnatal anxiety-like behaviour in the dam. This was accompanied by elevated DNMT3a gene expression in the PFC, suggesting this region may be sensitive to DNA methylation changes following maternal exercise. In contrast, maternal sertraline did not impact these behaviours or genes. Maintaining sertraline treatment beyond PN14, may have resulted in broader effects on dam behaviour, which should be explored further. Maternal sertraline did appear to have some adverse effects on the in utero environment, evidenced by smaller litters, with slightly smaller pup brain weights, which should be investigated further. Our findings suggest a long-term beneficial effect of exercise during pregnancy and supports future studies examining the effects of exercise in antenatal depression in the human population.

">Semi-automated analysis of beading in degenerating axons</a></h4>

              
                Axonal beading is a key morphological indicator of axonal degeneration, which plays a significant role in various neurodegenerative diseases and drug-induced neuropathies. Quantification of axonal susceptibility to beading using neuronal cell culture can be used as a facile assay to evaluate induced degenerative conditions, and thus aid in understanding mechanisms of beading and in drug development. Manual analysis of axonal beading for large datasets is labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity, limiting the reproducibility of results. To address these challenges, we developed a semi-automated Python-based tool to track axonal beading in time-lapse microscopy images. The software significantly reduces human effort by detecting the onset of axonal swelling. Our method is based on classical image processing techniques rather than an AI approach. This provides interpretable results while allowing the extraction of additional quantitative data, such as bead density, coarsening dynamics, and morphological changes over time. Comparison of results obtained through human analysis and the software shows strong agreement. The code can be easily extended to analyze diameter information of ridge-like structures in branched networks of rivers, road networks, blood vessels, etc.

">Psilocybin as a Treatment for Repetitive Mild Head Injury: Evidence from Neuroradiology and Molecular Biology</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive mild head injuries incurred while playing organized sports, during car accidents and falls, or in active military service are a major health problem. These head injuries induce cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits that can last for months and even years with an increased risk of dementia, Parkinson's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. There is no approved medical treatment for these types of head injuries. To this end, we tested the healing effects of the psychedelic psilocybin, as it is known to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance neuroplasticity. Using a model of mild repetitive head injury in adult female rats, we provide unprecedented data that psilocybin can reduce vasogenic edema, restore normal vascular reactivity and functional connectivity, reduce phosphorylated tau buildup, enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB, and modulate lipid signaling molecules.

">Identifying JNK-regulated phosphoproteome markers of anxiety-like behaviour in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                JNKs mediate neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disease and inhibitors of JNK1 have shown anxiolytic and anti-depressive effects in mice. Here, we analyze the phosphoproteomes of hippocampus and nucleus accumbens from DJNKI-1 (JNK inhibitor)-infused mice. We correlate phospho-site changes with anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze and light-dark test and identify unique changes in responder mice. Among the DJNKI-1 regulated phosphosites, several lie within GSK3 motifs and are exclusively down-regulated. Consistent with this, GSK3{beta} is inhibited and AKT activated. Importantly, we detect multilevel regulation of glucose metabolism enzymes including increased PDPK1-S241 phosphorylation, and a 5-fold increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1)-S-293 phosphorylation, signifying its inhibition. This suggests that JNK inhibitor drives a metabolic transformation to the neuronal Warburg response. This and a range of identified synaptic and cytoskeletal protein phosphosite changes are discussed in the context of JNK-regulated anxiety responses. The annotated hippocampal and nucleus accumbens phosphoproteomes described here will support a mechanistic understanding of the JNK pathway for future studies of brain disorders.

">Network Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Risk Derived from Joint Volume and Texture Covariance Patterns in Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks effective cures and is typically detected after substantial pathological changes have occurred, making intervention challenging. Early detection and understanding of risk factors and their downstream effects are therefore crucial. Animal models provide valuable tools to study these prodromal stages. We investigated various levels of genetic risk for AD using mice expressing the three major human APOE alleles in place of mouse APOE. We leverage these mouse models utilizing high-resolution magnetic resonance diffusion imaging, due to its ability to provide multiple parameters that can be analysed jointly. We examine how APOE genotype interacts with age, sex, diet, and immunity to yield jointly discernable changes in regional brain volume and fractional anisotropy, a sensitive metric for brain water diffusion. Our results demonstrate that genotype strongly influences the caudate putamen, pons, cingulate cortex, and cerebellum, while sex affects the amygdala and piriform cortex bilaterally. Immune status impacts numerous regions, including the parietal association cortices, thalamus, auditory cortex, V1, and bilateral dentate cerebellar nuclei. Risk factor interactions particularly affect the amygdala, thalamus, and pons. APOE2 mice on a regular diet exhibited the fewest temporal changes, suggesting resilience, while APOE3 mice showed minimal effects from a high-fat diet (HFD). HFD amplified aging effects across multiple brain regions. The interaction of AD risk factors, including diet, revealed significant changes in the periaqueductal gray, pons, amygdala, inferior colliculus, M1, and ventral orbital cortex. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms underlying these coordinated changes in volume and texture, potentially by examining network similarities in gene expression and metabolism, and their relationship to structural pathways involved in neurodegenerative disease progression.

">In the brain of the beholder: whole brain dynamics shape the perception during ambiguous motion</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception typically relies on a one-to-one mapping between stimuli and conscious experiences. However, under bistable conditions, identical sensory inputs can elicit alternating perceptions, requiring the brain to resolve ambiguity. The mechanisms underlying transitions between distinct perceptual states and their sustained maintenance remain poorly understood. In this ultra-high field (7T) fMRI study, we investigated the neural dynamics of perception using a bistable motion stimulus (ambiguous motion quartet) that evoked endogenous alternations between horizontal and vertical motion, compared to a control condition (physical motion quartet) with unambiguous sensory input. Consistent with prior findings, the human motion complex (hMT+) played a central role in processing both physical and ambiguous motion conditions. By dissociating neural activity during perceptual transitions from sustained perceptions, we found that hMT+ mostly interacts dynamically with area 46 in the frontal cortex and PF/PFm within the inferior parietal lobe during transitions and with subregions of the superior parietal lobe during sustained perceptions. Beyond local activity, computational modeling revealed increased hierarchical organization across cortical networks during the ambiguous condition. Notably, the same frontal and parietal regions exhibited ascension within the functional hierarchy, likely reflecting their specific role in coordinating computations for resolving ambiguity.

">Computational detection, characterization, and clustering of microglial cells in a mouse model of fat-induced postprandial hypothalamic inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is associated with brain inflammation, glial reactivity, and immune cells infiltration. Studies in rodents have shown that glial reactivity occurs within 24 hour of high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, long before obesity development, and takes place mainly in the hypothalamus (HT), a crucial brain structure for controlling body weight. Understanding more precisely the kinetics of glial activation of two major brain cells (astrocytes and microglia) and their impact on eating behavior could prevent obesity and offer new prospects for therapeutic treatments. To understand the mechanisms pertaining to obesity-related neuroinflammation, we developed a fully automated algorithm, NutriMorph. Although some algorithms were developed in the past decade to detect and segment cells, they are highly specific, not fully automatic, and do not provide the desired morphological analysis. Our algorithm cope with these issues and performs the analysis of cells images (here, microglia of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus), and the morphological clustering of these cells through statistical analysis and machine learning. Using the k-Means algorithm, it clusters the microglia of the control condition (healthy mice) and the different states of neuroinflammation induced by high-fat diets (obese mice) into subpopulations. This paper is an extension and re-analysis of a first published paper showing that microglial reactivity can already be seen after few hours of high-fat diet (Cansell et al., 2021). Thanks to NutriMorph algorithm, we unravel the presence of different hypothalamic microglial subpopulations (based on morphology) subject to proportion changes in response to already few hours of high-fat diet in mice.

">A conserved epilepsy-associated gene co-expression module identifies increased metabolic rate as a shared pathomechanism</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a mechanistically complex, incompletely understood neurological disorder. To uncover novel converging mechanisms in epilepsy, we used Drosophila whole-brain single-cell RNA-sequencing to refine and characterize a previously proposed human epilepsy-associated gene co-expression network (GCN). We identified a conserved co-expressed module of 26 genes, which comprises fly orthologs of 13 epilepsy-associated genes and integrates synaptic and metabolic functions. Over one-third of the Drosophila pan-neuronal knockdown models targeting this module exhibited altered seizure-like behaviors in response to mechanical or heat stress. These recapitulated seizures associated with four epilepsy-associated genes, identified two novel epilepsy candidate genes, and three genes knockdown of which conferred seizure protection. Most knockdown models with altered seizure susceptibility showed changes in metabolic rate and levels of phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Enhancing AMPK activity increased seizure resistance in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show that Drosophila single-cell expression data and behavior can aid functional validation of human GCNs and highlight a role for metabolism in modifying seizure susceptibility.

">Artificial sweeteners differentially activate sweet and bitter gustatory neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Artificial sweeteners are highly sweet, non-nutritive compounds that have become increasingly popular over recent decades despite research suggesting that their consumption has unintended consequences. Specifically, there is evidence suggesting that some of these chemicals interact with bitter taste receptors, implying that sweeteners likely generate complex chemosensory signals. Here, we report the basic sensory characteristics of sweeteners in Drosophila, a common model system used to study the impacts of diet, and find that all noncaloric sweeteners inhibited appetitive feeding responses at higher concentrations. At a cellular level, we found that sucralose and rebaudioside A co-activated sweet and bitter gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), two populations that reciprocally impact feeding behavior, while aspartame only activated bitter cells. We assessed the behavioral impacts of sweet and bitter co-activation and found that low concentrations of sucralose signal appetitive feeding while high concentrations signal feeding aversion. Finally, silencing bitter GRNs reduced the aversive signal elicited by high concentrations of sucralose and significantly increased sucralose feeding behaviors. Together, we conclude that artificial sweeteners generate a gustatory signal that is more complex than sweetness alone, and this bitter co-activation has behaviorally relevant effects on feeding that may help flies flexibly respond to these unique compounds.

">Guiding G protein signaling by target enhancement of GPCRs</a></h4>

              
                Activation of G protein coupled receptors coupling to the Gi/o pathway leads to the activation of G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channels (GIRK) in a fast membrane-delimited manner in excitable cells. Activation of GIRK causes the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, where hyperpolarization is dependent on te availability of Gi/o coupled GPCRs and GIRK. In particular, in optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments neuronal silencing depends on downstream targets of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs. To selectively enhance Gi/o mediated GIRK currents, we created expression cassettes consisting of a homomer forming GIRK subunit and various light-activated Gi/o-coupled GPCRs (Melanopsin, Long-wave-sensitive opsin 1, Parapinopsin or Opsin 7b). We demonstrate that light-activation of the GIRK/GPCR constructs induces robust GIRK currents in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, cardiomyocytes and cerebellar Purkinje cells and changes the net effect of G protein signaling of the promiscuous Opn4L from a Gq/11 mediated excitation towards an Gi/o mediated inhibition. Thus, our tools enhance target selectivity and improve optogenetic control of the Gi/o pathway by light in excitable cells.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Non-response to initial treatment options for major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common clinical challenge with profound deleterious impacts for affected patients. Few treatments have received regulatory approval for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: A systematic search of United States and European Union clinical trials registries was conducted to identify Phase II, III, or IV clinical trials, with a last update posted on or after 1 January 2020, that were evaluating medications for TRD. For both the US and EU registries, the condition term &amp;amp;ldquo;treatment resistant depression&amp;amp;rdquo; and associated lower-level terms (per registry search protocol) were used. For the US registry, a secondary search using the condition term &amp;amp;ldquo;depressive disorders&amp;amp;rdquo; and the modifying term &amp;amp;ldquo;inadequate&amp;amp;rdquo; was also performed to capture registrations not tagged as TRD. Two additional searches were also conducted in the US registry for the terms &amp;amp;ldquo;suicide&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;anhedonia&amp;amp;rdquo; as transdiagnostic targets of investigational medications. Trials were categorized based on the primary mechanism of action of the trial&amp;amp;rsquo;s investigational medication. Results: Fifty clinical trials for TRD, 20 for anhedonia, and 25 for suicide were identified. Glutamate system modulation was the mechanism currently with the most compounds in development, including antagonists and allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, metabotropic type 2/3 glutamate receptors, and intracellular effector molecules downstream of glutamate signaling. Psychedelics have seen the greatest surge among mechanistic targets in the past 5 years, however, with psilocybin in particular garnering significant attention. Other mechanisms included GABA modulators, monoamine modulators, anti-inflammatory/immune-modulating agents, and an orexin type 2 receptor antagonist. Conclusions: These investigations offer substantial promise for more efficacious and potentially personalized medication approaches for TRD. Challenges for detecting efficacy in TRD include the heterogeneity within the TRD population stemming from the presumed variety of biological dysfunctions underlying the disorder, comorbid disorders, chronic psychosocial stressors, and enduring effects of prior serotonergic antidepressant medication treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Posterior cervical fusion (PCF) is widely used for cervical spinal cord decompression with/without fusion. In our hybrid operating room, intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) is routinely used to verify screw placement. This study analyzed clinical and radiological outcomes after PCF and evaluated iCT benefits for detecting screw misplacement. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent PCF between March 2012 and April 2016 for degenerative (n = 6), neoplastic (n = 7), and traumatic (n = 6) conditions. Seven patients had primary PCF, while twelve underwent PCF following anterior fusion due to segmental instability with cervical malalignment (n = 11) or tumor progression (n = 1). Results: The mean patient age was 59 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years, with 63% male patients. The median follow-up was 21 months. PCF averaged 4.74 segments (range: 1&amp;amp;ndash;9). At follow-up, 79% reported pain improvement and normal sensorimotor function. Of six patients with preoperative paresis, five showed improved muscle strength. No persistent gait disturbances occurred. Complications requiring revision occurred in four patients (21%): three surgical site infections and one cerebrospinal fluid leak. One perioperative death occurred (5%). iCT detected incorrect screw placement in seven patients (36%), allowing the immediate repositioning of eight screws, preventing later revision surgeries. The overall fusion rate was 92%. Conclusions: PCF with iCT is safe and effective for various cervical spine pathologies, yielding good long-term clinical outcomes. iCT effectively detects and enables immediate correction of screw malposition, reducing revision surgery needs. This imaging modality demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for identifying clinically relevant screw malpositions.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is recognized as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, with its incidence rate projected to increase alongside ongoing population growth. However, the precise etiology of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease remains elusive. This article explores the inflammatory mechanisms linking gut microbiota to Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites that influence the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression through the bidirectional transmission of inflammatory signals along the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Building on this mechanistic framework, this article further discusses research methodologies and treatment strategies focused on gut microbiota metabolites, including metabolomics detection techniques, animal model investigations, and therapeutic approaches such as dietary interventions, probiotic treatments, and fecal transplantation. Ultimately, this article aims to elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota metabolites and the inflammatory mechanisms underlying Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, thereby paving the way for novel avenues in the research and treatment of this condition.</p>

	<p>Background: Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN), affecting A&amp;amp;delta; or C nerve fibers, is characterized by alterations of pain and temperature sensation, as well as autonomic dysfunction. Its diagnosis may still remain challenging as methods specifically assessing small nerve fibers are not always readily available, and standard techniques for large-fiber neuropathies, such as electroneuromyography, yield negative results. Still, skin biopsy for epidermal innervation and quantitative sensory testing allow for diagnosis in the presence of a congruent clinical picture. Objectives: Many different etiologies may underlie small-fiber neuropathy, of which metabolic (diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance) and idiopathic remain prevalent. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a general picture of SFN while focusing on the different etiologies described in the literature in order to raise awareness of the variegated set of different causes of SFN and promote adequate diagnostic investigation. Methods: The term &amp;amp;ldquo;Small-Fiber Neuropathy&amp;amp;rdquo; was searched on the PubMed database with its different recognized etiologies: the abstracts of the articles were reviewed and described in the article if relevant for a total of 40 studies. Results: Many different disorders have been associated with SFN, even though often in the form of case reports or small case series. Conclusions: Idiopathic forms of SFN remain the most prevalent in the literature, but association with different disorders (e.g., infectious, autoimmune) should prompt investigation for SFN in the presence of a congruent clinical picture (e.g., pain with neuropathic features).</p>

	<p>Background: Variability in recanalization success during endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has led to increased interests in thrombus composition and associated cellular materials. While evidence suggests that bacteria may influence thrombus characteristics, limited data exist on microbiological profiles of thrombi in stroke patients. Objectives: Characterization of bacterial communities present in thrombi of AIS patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, providing insights into microbial contributions to stroke pathogenesis and treatment outcomes. Methods: Thrombi were collected from 20 AIS patients. After extracting metagenome, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed. Bioinformatic analysis included taxonomy and diversity assessments. The presence of bacterial DNA and viable bacteria in thrombi was validated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial culturing followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization&amp;amp;ndash;time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis, respectively. Results: 16S rDNA was amplified in 19/20 thrombi (95%). Analysis identified a diverse microbial community, with Corynebacterium spp. as the most prevalent genus, followed by Staphylococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Methylobacterium spp., and Anaerococcus spp. Alpha diversity analyses (Shannon index: 4.0&amp;amp;ndash;6.0 and Simpson index: 0.8&amp;amp;ndash;1.0) revealed moderate to high microbial diversity across samples; beta diversity demonstrated distinct clustering, indicating inter-patient variability in microbial profiles. PCR confirmed the presence of DNA specific to dominant bacterial taxa identified through sequencing. Culturing showed the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis in some clots as identified through MALDI analysis. Conclusions: This study shows bacterial communities present in AIS patients&amp;amp;rsquo; thrombi, suggesting a potential link between microbial signatures and thrombus characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/6/e0068242024?rss=1">Lesions to Different Regions of the Frontal Cortex Have Dissociable Effects on Voluntary Persistence in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deciding how long to keep waiting for uncertain future rewards is a complex problem. Previous research has shown that choosing to stop waiting results from an evaluative process that weighs the subjective value of the awaited reward against the opportunity cost of waiting. Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracks the dynamics of this evaluation, while activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI) ramps up before a decision to quit is made. Here, we provide causal evidence of the necessity of these brain regions for successful performance in a willingness-to-wait task. Twenty-eight participants (20 female and 8 male) with lesions to different regions of the frontal lobe were tested on their ability to adaptively calibrate how long they waited for monetary rewards. We found that participants with lesions to the vmPFC waited less overall, while participants with lesions to the dmPFC and anterior insula were specifically impaired at calibrating their level of persistence to the environment. These behavioral effects were accounted for by systematic differences in parameter estimates from a computational model of task performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/6/e0233242024?rss=1">The Dimensionality of Neural Coding for Cognitive Control Is Gradually Transformed within the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive control relies on neural representations that are inherently high-dimensional and distributed across multiple subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Traditional approaches tackle prefrontal representation by reducing it into a unidimensional measure (univariate amplitude) or using it to distinguish a limited number of alternatives (pattern classification). In contrast, representational similarity analysis (RSA) enables flexibly formulating various hypotheses about informational contents underlying the neural codes, explicitly comparing hypotheses, and examining the representational alignment between brain regions. Here, we used a multifaceted paradigm wherein the difficulty of cognitive control was manipulated separately for five cognitive tasks. We used RSA to unveil representational contents, measure the representational alignment between regions, and quantify representational generality versus specificity. We found a graded transition in the lateral PFC: The dorsocaudal PFC was tuned to task difficulty (indexed by reaction times), preferentially connected with the parietal cortex, and representationally generalizable across domains. The ventrorostral PFC was tuned to the abstract structure of tasks, preferentially connected with the temporal cortex, and representationally specific. The middle PFC (interposed between the dorsocaudal and ventrorostral PFC) was tuned to individual task sets and ranked in the middle in terms of connectivity and generalizability. Furthermore, whether a region was dimensionally rich or sparse covaried with its functional profile: Low dimensionality (only gist) in the dorsocaudal PFC dovetailed with better generality, whereas high dimensionality (gist plus details) in the ventrorostral PFC corresponded with better ability to encode subtleties. Our findings, collectively, demonstrate how cognitive control is decomposed into distinct facets that transition steadily along prefrontal subregions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/6/e0298242024?rss=1">Targeting Tiam1 Enhances Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory in the Adult Brain and Promotes NMDA Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Plasticity and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Excitatory synapses and the actin-rich dendritic spines on which they reside are indispensable for information processing and storage in the brain. In the adult hippocampus, excitatory synapses must balance plasticity and stability to support learning and memory. However, the mechanisms governing this balance remain poorly understood. Tiam1 is an actin cytoskeleton regulator prominently expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) throughout life. Previously, we showed that Tiam1 promotes dentate granule cell synapse and spine stabilization during development, but its role in the adult hippocampus remains unclear. Here, we deleted Tiam1 from adult forebrain excitatory neurons (<I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I>) and assessed the effects on hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Adult male and female <I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I> mice displayed enhanced contextual fear memory, fear extinction, and spatial discrimination. Investigation into underlying mechanisms revealed that dentate granule cells from <I>Tiam1<sup>fKO</sup></I> brain slices exhibited augmented synaptic plasticity and N-methyl-D-aspartate&ndash;type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) function. Additionally, Tiam1 loss in primary hippocampal neurons blocked agonist-induced NMDAR internalization, reduced filamentous actin levels, and promoted activity-dependent spine remodeling. Notably, strong NMDAR activation in wild-type hippocampal neurons triggered Tiam1 loss from spines. Our results suggest that Tiam1 normally constrains hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in the adult brain by restricting NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity in the DG. We propose that Tiam1 achieves this by limiting NMDAR availability at synaptic membranes and stabilizing spine actin cytoskeleton and that these constraints can be alleviated by activity-dependent degradation of Tiam1. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism restricting hippocampal synaptic plasticity and highlight Tiam1 as a therapeutic target for enhancing cognitive function.</p>

                <p>Reward-predictive cues can affect decision-making by enhancing instrumental responses toward the same (specific transfer) or similar (general transfer) rewards. The main theories on cue-guided decision-making consider specific transfer as driven by the activation of previously learned instrumental actions induced by cues sharing the sensory-specific properties of the reward they are associated with. However, to date, such theoretical assumption has never been directly investigated at the neural level. We hypothesize that such reactivation occurs within the premotor system and could be mapped by lateralized beta (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) desynchronization, a widely used marker of action selection and decision-making policy. To test this hypothesis, 42 participants (22 females) performed a pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer paradigm, while electroencephalographic activity was recorded. We anticipated increased beta desynchronization during the transfer phase when cues promoting specific transfer were presented, compared with cues predicting general transfer and neutral cues. The evidence collected confirmed our hypothesis, thus providing the first neural evidence in favor of the theorized reactivation of instrumental actions and corroborating the presence of two dissociable neural pathways underpinning specific and general transfer.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/6/e0467242024?rss=1">A New Insight into the Role of CART Peptide in Serotonergic Function and Anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide has been implicated in stress-related behaviors that are regulated by central serotonergic (5-HT) systems in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Here, we aimed to investigate the interaction between CART and DRN 5-HTergic systems after initially observing CART axonal terminals in the DRN. We found that microinfusion of CART peptide <SUB>(55&ndash;102)</SUB> into the DRN-induced anxiogenic effects in male C57BL/6J mice, while central administration of CART reduced c-Fos in 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> neurons. This inhibitory effect of exogenous CART on 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> activity and local 5-HT release was also demonstrated via in vivo fiber photometry coupled with calcium and 5-HT biosensors. CART inputs to the DRN were observed in various subcortical nuclei, but only those in the centrally projecting Edinger&ndash;Westphal nucleus (EWcp) were highly responsive to stress. Chemogenetic activation of these DRN-projecting CART<sup>EWcp</sup> neurons recapitulated the effects of intra-DRN CART infusion on anxiety-like behavior in males, but not in females, suggesting a sex-specific role for this pathway. Interestingly, CART<sup>EWcp</sup> projections to the DRN made direct synaptic contact primarily with non-5-HT neurons, which were also found to express putative CART receptors. Furthermore, chemogenetic stimulation of this CART<sup>EWcp-&gt;DRN</sup> pathway inhibited 5-HT neurons while increasing activity in local GABAergic neurons. In summary, this study establishes for the first time a neuromodulatory role for CART<sup>EWcp</sup> neurons in 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> neurotransmission and suggests that CART may drive anxiety-like behavior by promoting feedforward inhibition of 5-HT neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/6/e0678242024?rss=1">The C. elegans uv1 Neuroendocrine Cells Provide Mechanosensory Feedback of Vulval Opening</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroendocrine cells react to physical, chemical, and synaptic signals originating from tissues and the nervous system, releasing hormones that regulate various body functions beyond the synapse. Neuroendocrine cells are often embedded in complex tissues making direct tests of their activation mechanisms and signaling effects difficult to study. In the nematode worm <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, four uterine-vulval (uv1) neuroendocrine cells sit above the vulval canal next to the egg-laying circuit, releasing tyramine and neuropeptides that feedback to inhibit egg laying. We have previously shown uv1 cells are mechanically deformed during egg laying, driving uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. However, whether egg-laying circuit activity, vulval opening, and/or egg release triggered uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was unclear. Here, we show uv1 responds directly to mechanical activation. Optogenetic vulval muscle stimulation triggers uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity following muscle contraction even in sterile animals. Direct mechanical prodding with a glass probe placed against the worm cuticle triggers robust uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity similar to that seen during egg laying. Direct mechanical activation of uv1 cells does not require other cells in the egg-laying circuit, synaptic or peptidergic neurotransmission, or transient receptor potential vanilloid  and Piezo channels. EGL-19 L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but not P/Q/N-type or ryanodine receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, promote uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity following mechanical activation. L-type channels also facilitate the coordinated activation of uv1 cells across the vulva, suggesting mechanical stimulation of one uv1 cell cross-activates the other. Our findings show how neuroendocrine cells like uv1 report on the mechanics of tissue deformation and muscle contraction, facilitating feedback to local circuits to coordinate behavior.</p>

                <p>We employed high-resolution fMRI to distinguish the impacts of anisometropia and strabismus amblyopia on the evoked ocular dominance (OD) response. Sixteen amblyopic participants (eight females) plus eight individuals with normal vision (one female), participated in this study for whom we measured the difference between the response to stimulation of the two eyes, across areas V1&ndash;V4. In controls, the evoked OD response formed the expected striped pattern within V1. Compared to controls, the OD response in amblyopic participants formed larger fused patches that extended into downstream visual areas. Moreover, both anisometropic and strabismic participants showed elevated OD responses across V1&ndash;V4. Beyond these common effects, and despite similar densities of amblyopia between the two groups, strabismus, and anisometropia had differential impacts on the OD bias, binocular response, and correlation between V1 depth levels. Specifically, we found a greater increase in the size of the V1 portion that responded preferentially to fellow eye stimulation in anisometropic compared with strabismic individuals. We also found a greater difference between the amplitudes of the response to binocular stimulation, in those regions that responded preferentially to the fellow versus amblyopic eye, in anisometropic compared with strabismic participants. In contrast, strabismic participants demonstrated an increased correlation between the OD responses evoked within V1 superficial and deep depths, whereas anisometropic individuals did not. These results provide the primary direct functional evidence for distinct impacts of strabismus and anisometropia on the mesoscale functional organization of the human visual system, thus extending what was inferred previously about amblyopia from animal models.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) has a multifaceted role in healthy and disordered brains through its action on multiple subtypes of dopaminergic receptors. How the modulation of these receptors influences learning and motivation by altering intrinsic brain-wide networks remains unclear. Here, we performed parallel behavioral and resting-state functional MRI experiments after administration of two different DA receptor antagonists in male and female macaque monkeys. Systemic administration of SCH-23390 (D1 antagonist) slowed probabilistic learning when subjects had to learn new stimulus&ndash;reward associations and diminished functional connectivity (FC) in corticocortical and frontostriatal connections. In contrast, haloperidol (D2 antagonist) improved learning and broadly enhanced FC in cortical connections. Further comparisons between the effect of SCH-23390/haloperidol on behavioral and resting-state FC revealed specific cortical and subcortical networks associated with the cognitive and motivational effects of DA manipulation, respectively. Thus, we reveal distinct brain-wide networks that are associated with the dopaminergic control of learning and motivation via DA receptors.</p>

                <p>The precuneus is a site of early amyloid-beta (A&beta;) accumulation. Previous cross-sectional studies reported increased precuneus fMRI activity in older adults with mild cognitive deficits or elevated A&beta;. However, longitudinal studies in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) are lacking and the relationship to the Apolipoprotein-E (<I>APOE</I>) genotype is unclear. Investigating the PREVENT-AD dataset, we assessed how baseline and longitudinal precuneus activity during successful memory retrieval relates to future A&beta; and tau burden and change in memory performance. We further studied the moderation by <I>APOE</I>4 genotype. We included 165 older adults (age, 62.8 &plusmn; 4.4&nbsp;years; 113 female; 66 <I>APOE</I>4 carriers) who were cognitively normal at baseline with a family history of AD. All participants performed task-fMRI at baseline and underwent <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir-PET and <sup>18</sup>F-NAV4694-A&beta;-PET on average 5&nbsp;years later. We found that higher baseline activity and greater longitudinal increase in precuneus activity were associated with higher A&beta; burden in <I>APOE</I>4 carriers but not noncarriers. We observed no effects of precuneus activity on tau burden. Finally, <I>APOE</I>4 noncarriers with low baseline precuneus activity exhibited better longitudinal performance in an independent memory test compared with (1) noncarriers with higher baseline activity and (2) <I>APOE</I>4 carriers. Our findings suggest that higher task-related precuneus activity during memory retrieval at baseline and over time are associated with greater A&beta; burden in cognitively normal <I>APOE</I>4 carriers. Our results further indicate that the absence of "hyperactivation" and the absence of the <I>APOE</I>4 allele is related with better future cognitive outcomes in cognitively normal older adults at risk for AD.</p>

                <p>The mammalian auditory system encodes sounds with subtypes of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that differ in sound level sensitivity, permitting discrimination across a wide range of levels. Recent work suggests the physiologically defined SGN subtypes correspond to at least three molecular subtypes. It is not known how information from the different subtypes converges within the cochlear nucleus. We examined this issue using transgenic mice of both sexes that express Cre recombinase in SGNs that are positive for markers of two subtypes: CALB2 (calretinin) in type 1a SGNs and LYPD1 in type 1c SGNs, which correspond to high- and low-sensitivity subtypes, respectively. We crossed these with mice expressing floxed channelrhodopsin, which allowed specific activation of axons from type 1a or 1c SGNs using optogenetics. We made voltage-clamp recordings from bushy cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and found that the synapses formed by CALB2- and LYPD1-positive SGNs had similar EPSC amplitudes and short-term plasticity. Immunohistochemistry revealed that individual bushy cells receive a mix of 1a, 1b, and 1c synapses with VGluT1-positive puncta of similar sizes. We used optogenetic stimulation during in vivo recordings to classify chopper and primary-like units as receiving versus nonreceiving 1a- or 1c-type inputs. These groups showed no significant difference in threshold or spontaneous rate, suggesting the subtypes do not segregate into distinct processing streams in the AVCN. Our results indicate that principal cells in the AVCN integrate information from all SGN subtypes with extensive convergence, which could optimize sound encoding across a large dynamic range.</p>

                <p>The gustatory system allows animals to assess the nutritive value and safety of foods prior to ingestion. The first step in gustation is the interaction of taste stimuli with one or more specific sensory receptors that are generally believed to be present on the apical surface of the taste receptor cells. However, this assertion is rarely tested. We recently identified OTOP1 as a proton channel and showed that it is required for taste response to acids (sour) and ammonium. Here, we examined the cellular and subcellular localization of OTOP1 by tagging the endogenous OTOP1 protein with an N-terminal HA epitope (HA-OTOP1). Using both male and female HA-OTOP1 mice and high-resolution imaging, we show that OTOP1 is strictly localized to the apical tips of taste cells throughout the tongue and oral cavity. Interestingly, immunoreactivity is observed in the actin-rich taste pore above the tight junctions defined by zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and also immediately below these junctions. Surprisingly, OTOP1 immunoreactivity is not restricted to Type III taste receptor cells (TRCs) that mediate sour taste but is also observed in glia-like Type I TRCs proposed to perform housekeeping functions, a result that is corroborated by scRNA-seq data. The apical localization of OTOP1 supports the contention that OTOP1 functions as a taste receptor and suggests that OTOP1 may be accessible to orally available compounds that could act as taste modifiers.</p>

                <p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are a specialized extracellular matrix that surrounds certain populations of neurons, including (inhibitory) parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons throughout the brain and (excitatory) CA2 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus. PNNs are thought to regulate synaptic plasticity by stabilizing synapses and as such, could regulate learning and memory. Most often, PNN functions are queried using enzymatic degradation with chondroitinase, but that approach does not differentiate PNNs on CA2 neurons from those on adjacent PV cells. To disentangle the specific roles of PNNs on CA2 pyramidal cells and PV neurons in behavior, we generated conditional knock-out mouse strains with the primary protein component of PNNs, aggrecan (<I>Acan</I>), deleted from either CA2 pyramidal cells (Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO) or from PV cells (PV <I>Acan</I> KO). Male and female animals of each strain were tested for social, fear, and spatial memory, as well as for reversal learning. We found that Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO animals, but not PV <I>Acan</I> KO animals, had impaired social memory and reversal learning. PV <I>Acan</I> KOs, but not Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KOs, had impaired contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate independent roles for PNNs on each cell type in regulating hippocampal-dependent memory. We further investigated a potential mechanism of impaired social memory in the Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KO animals and found reduced input to CA2 from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which signals social novelty. Additionally, Amigo2 <I>Acan</I> KOs lacked a social novelty-related local field potential response, suggesting that CA2 PNNs may coordinate functional SuM connections and associated physiological responses to social novelty.</p>

                <p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels are crucial for detecting and transmitting nociceptive stimuli. Inflammatory pain is associated with sustained increases in TRPA1 and TRPV1 expression in primary sensory neurons. However, the epigenetic mechanisms driving this upregulation remain unknown. G9a (encoded by <I>Ehmt2</I>) catalyzes H3K9me2 and generally represses gene transcription. In this study, we found that intrathecal administration of UNC0638, a specific G9a inhibitor, or G9a-specific siRNA, substantially reduced complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain hypersensitivity. Remarkably, CFA treatment did not induce persistent pain hypersensitivity in male and female mice with conditional <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analyses showed that CFA treatment caused a sustained increase in mRNA levels of <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> in the DRG. <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in DRG neurons elevated baseline <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> mRNA levels but notably reversed CFA-induced increases in their expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that CFA treatment reduced G9a and H3K9me2 levels while increasing H3K9ac and H3K4me3&mdash;activating histone marks&mdash;at <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> promoters in the DRG. Strikingly, conditional <I>Ehmt2</I> knock-out in DRG neurons not only diminished H3K9me2 but also reversed CFA-induced increases in H3K9ac and H3K4me3 at <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> promoters. Our findings suggest that G9a in primary sensory neurons constitutively represses <I>Trpa1</I> and <I>Trpv1</I> transcription under normal conditions but paradoxically enhances their transcription during tissue inflammation. This latter action accounts for inflammation-induced TRPA1 and TRPV1 upregulation in the DRG. Thus, G9a could be targeted for alleviating persistent inflammatory pain.</p>

                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in high-level cognitive functions and emotional behaviors, and PFC alterations correlate with different brain disorders including major depression and anxiety. In mice, the first two postnatal weeks represent a critical period of high sensitivity to environmental changes. In this temporal window, serotonin (5-HT) levels regulate the wiring of PFC cortical neurons. Early-life insults and postnatal exposure to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) affect PFC development leading to depressive and anxiety-like phenotypes in adult mice. However, the mechanisms responsible for these dysfunctions remain obscure. We found that early postnatal FLX exposure (PNFLX) results in reduced overall firing and high-frequency bursting of putative pyramidal neurons (PNs) of deep layers of the medial PFC of adult mice of both sexes in vivo. Ex vivo, patch-clamp recordings revealed that PNFLX abolished high-frequency firing in a distinct subpopulation of deep-layer mPFC PNs, which transiently express the serotonin transporter SERT during the first 2 postnatal weeks. SERT+ and SERT&ndash; PNs exhibit distinct morphofunctional properties. Genetic deletion of 5-HT7Rs and pharmacological 5-HT7R blockade partially rescued both the PNFLX-induced reduction of PN firing in vivo and the altered firing of SERT+ PNs in vitro. This indicates a pivotal role of this 5-HTR subtype in mediating 5-HT-dependent maturation of PFC circuits that are susceptible to early-life insults. Overall, our results suggest potential novel neurobiological mechanisms, underlying detrimental neurodevelopmental consequences induced by early-life alterations of 5-HT levels.</p>

                <p>Observing lip movements of a speaker facilitates speech understanding, especially in challenging listening situations. Converging evidence from neuroscientific studies shows stronger neural responses to audiovisual stimuli compared with audio-only stimuli. However, the interindividual variability of this contribution of lip movement information and its consequences on behavior are unknown. We analyzed source-localized magnetoencephalographic responses from 29 normal-hearing participants (12 females) listening to audiovisual speech, both with and without the speaker wearing a surgical face mask, and in the presence or absence of a distractor speaker. Using temporal response functions to quantify neural speech tracking, we show that neural responses to lip movements are, in general, enhanced when speech is challenging. After controlling for speech acoustics, we show that lip movements contribute to enhanced neural speech tracking, particularly when a distractor speaker is present. However, the extent of this visual contribution to neural speech tracking varied greatly among participants. Probing the behavioral relevance, we demonstrate that individuals who show a higher contribution of lip movements in terms of neural speech tracking show a stronger drop in comprehension and an increase in perceived difficulty when the mouth is occluded by a surgical face mask. In contrast, no effect was found when the mouth was not occluded. We provide novel insights on how the contribution of lip movements in terms of neural speech tracking varies among individuals and its behavioral relevance, revealing negative consequences when visual speech is absent. Our results also offer potential implications for objective assessments of audiovisual speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-166/v1?src=rss">The reproducibility of cervical vertebrae maturation: A cross-sectional comparative study between two methods [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background The cervical vertebral maturation method serves as a predictive tool for assessing growth status through the analysis of cervical vertebrae morphology. Prior to initiating treatment, it is crucial to ascertain the maturation stage to identify the optimal timing for intervention. In the context of cervical vertebral maturation assessment, two predominant methodologies are commonly employed, the Cervical Vertebrae Maturation (CVM) and the Cervical Stage (CS). This study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of these two methods. Methods Ninety cephalometric radiographs that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Two orthodontists classified the cervical vertebrae using the Baccetti, Franchi and McNamara method published in 2002 (CVM) and 2005 (CS) through manual tracing. Intra- and interexaminer reliability were analyzed using Weighted Kappa values. Results The intraexaminer reliability for CVM method in both examiners were described as almost perfect agreement. (κw = 0.86 and κw = 0.87). Intraexaminer reliability for CS method in both examiners were almost perfect agreement (κw = 0.95 and κw = 0.88). Agreement between examiners in the CVM method was moderate (κw = 0.66), and in the CS method, it was substantial (κw = 0.82). Conclusions The CS method showed superior reproducibility compared to the CVM method as a result of its more straightforward assessment approach. When assessing growth status using the cervical vertebrae analysis method, the CS method is more reliable than CVM method.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-199/v3?src=rss">Social distancing between personal belongings during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to instructions and suggestions from governments and experts to maintain social (physical) distance between people to prevent aerosol transmission of the virus, which is now becoming the norm. Thus, we examined whether the pandemic extended the distance between personal belongings. Methods We recruited 68 university students and instructed them to place their belongings on a long table following another participant (i.e., confederate). We measured the physical distance between the two belongings (i.e., the participant’s and the confederate’s). We collected data between June 10, 2022 and January 23, 2023. Pre-pandemic data was from Ariga (2016). Analysis was completed with one-tailed t-tests. Results Compared with the pre-pandemic results, via one-tailed t-test, the distance between the two belongings during the pandemic was significantly longer. Our results supported the hypothesis that the psychological framework for processing people’s belongings has dramatically changed during this pandemic. Conclusion This change may have been driven by social distancing practices or an increase in perceived vulnerability to disease. Our results provide new implications for future public spatial design, in other words, not only the distance between people, but also the distance between their belongings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-165/v1?src=rss">Engaging Sustainable Reforestation and Forest Protection in the Wallacea Line, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                <p>by Jamel Simpson, Peter M. Kasson</p>

Betacoronaviruses pose an ongoing pandemic threat. Antigenic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown that much of the spontaneous antibody response is narrowly focused rather than broadly neutralizing against even SARS-CoV-2 variants, let alone future threats. One way to overcome this is by focusing the antibody response against better-conserved regions of the viral spike protein. This has been demonstrated empirically in prior work, but we posit that systematic design tools will further potentiate antigenic focusing approaches. Here, we present a design approach to predict stable chimeras between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, creating synthetic spike proteins that display a desired conserved region, in this case S2, and vary other regions. We leverage AlphaFold to predict chimeric structures and create a new metric for scoring chimera stability based on AlphaFold outputs. We evaluated 114 candidate spike chimeras using this approach. Top chimeras were further evaluated using molecular dynamics simulation as an intermediate validation technique, showing good stability compared to low-scoring controls. Experimental testing of five predicted-stable and two predicted-unstable chimeras confirmed 5/7 predictions, with one intermediate result. This demonstrates the feasibility of the underlying approach, which can be used to design custom immunogens to focus the immune response against a desired viral glycoprotein epitope.

                <p>by Katy Poncin, Samantha A. McKeand, Hayley Lavender, Kacper Kurzyp, Odile B. Harrison, Annabell Roberti, Charlotte Melia, Errin Johnson, Martin C. J. Maiden, David R. Greaves, Rachel Exley, Christoph M. Tang</p>

<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is a human-specific pathogen that causes the important sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhoea, an inflammatory condition of the genitourinary tract. The bacterium is closely related to the meningococcus, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. Both these invasive bacterial species undergo autolysis when in the stationary phase of growth. Autolysis is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) which is part of the life cycle of remarkably few bacteria and poses an evolutionary conundrum as altruistic death provides no obvious benefit for single-celled organisms. Here, we searched for genes present in these 2 invasive species but not in other members of the <i>Neisseria</i> genus. We identified a ~3.4 kb horizontally acquired region, we termed the <i>nap</i> island, which is largely restricted to the gonococcus and meningococcus. The <i>nap</i> island in the gonococcus encodes 3 cationic, bacteriocin-like peptides which have no detectable antimicrobial activity. Instead, the gonococcal <i>N</i><i>eisseria</i> autolysis peptides (Naps) promote autolytic cell death when bacteria enter the stationary phase of growth. Furthermore, strains lacking the Naps exhibit reduced autolysis in assays of PCD. Expression of Naps is likely to be phase variable, explaining how PCD could have arisen in these important human pathogens. NapC also induces lysis of human cells, so the peptides are likely to have multiple roles during colonisation and disease. The acquisition of the nap island contributed to the emergence of PCD in the gonococcus and meningococcus and potentially to the appearance of invasive disease in <i>Neisseria</i> spp.

                <p>by Jiwon Yu, Junha Cha, Geon Koh, Insuk Lee</p>

Cell type-specific actions of disease genes add a significant layer of complexity to the genetic architecture underlying diseases, obscuring our understanding of disease mechanisms. Single-cell omics have revealed the functional roles of genes at the cellular level, identifying cell types critical for disease progression. Often, a gene impact on disease through its altered network within specific cell types, rather than mere changes in expression levels. To explore the cell type-specific roles of disease genes, we developed HCNetlas (human cell network atlas), a resource cataloging cell type-specific gene networks (CGNs) for various healthy tissue cells. We also devised 3 network analysis methods to investigate cell type-specific functions of disease genes. These methods involve comparing HCNetlas CGNs with those derived from disease-affected tissue samples. These methods find that systemic lupus erythematosus genes predominantly function in myeloid cells, and Alzheimer’s disease genes mainly play roles in inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Additionally, they suggest that many lung cancer-related genes may exert their roles in immune cells. These findings suggest that HCNetlas has the potential to link disease-associated genes to cell types of action, facilitating development of cell type-resolved diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for complex human diseases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is diagnosed by imaging and clinical scoring using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS). These methods have limited value for prognosis. Here, the prognostic value of plasma neurofilament-light (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and contactin-1 (CNTN-1) was analyzed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Biomarker levels were determined in the plasma of traumatic SCI patients (<i>n</i> = 37) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 22). SCI samples (<i>n</i> = 112) were collected at different time points from 0 to 4 days to 18 weeks post-injury. NfL and GFAP were measured by single molecule array (Simoa) technology, CNTN-1 by Luminex. Baseline and outcome AIS and motor scores were collected as a measure of injury severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NfL, GFAP, and CNTN-1 showed different kinetics in SCI patients over time. Baseline biomarker levels could identify AIS-A SCI patients (NfL + GFAP) and discriminate between patients with a motor score change &lt;5 and those with a change ≥5 (NfL + GFAP+CNTN-1). Longitudinally, NfL could identify AIS-A patients up to 12 weeks post-SCI and discriminate between patients with a motor score change &lt;5 and those with a change ≥5 up to 18 weeks post-SCI. Further, baseline biomarker levels positively (NfL + GFAP) or negatively (CNTN-1) correlated with outcome injury severity and together could accurately predict AIS conversion (AUC 0.863) and motor score change (AUC 0.857). This predictive ability was maintained in subacute/chronic SCI stages.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In conclusion, plasma NfL, GFAP, and CNTN-1 are potential prognostic biomarkers in SCI. This is important for patient stratification in clinical trials, prediction of neurological outcome and informed decision-making in SCI treatment and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Sudden death is an important global public health issue. An autopsy is an important source of epidemiological data, as the considerable causes of sudden death remain hermetic until postmortem examination. This study is devoted to evaluating the sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and pathological characteristics of sudden deaths of various ages in Ethiopia. Methods This is an observational, prospective, descriptive study that included all sudden deaths observed over 1 year at St. Paul’s Hospital and Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Results Sudden death (n = 568) accounted for 11.5% (95% CI: 10.6-12.4) of all autopsied cases. There were 482 males and 86 females (M:F ratio of 5.6:1) and a mean age of 44.8±17.349. The peak age group was the fourth and fifth decades, accounting for 43.9% of the cases. Chronic substance abuse and a history of prior illness were declared in 40.1% and 38% of cases of sudden death, respectively. Cardiovascular (36.1%), respiratory (32.6%), and gastrointestinal system (19.5%) pathologies were the most common causes. The leading underlying causes of sudden death were ischemic heart disease and pneumonia. Most (86.6%) sudden deaths occurred outside of a hospital setting. Conclusions Most of the causes of sudden death in Ethiopia can be prevented and treated. The majority of sudden deaths are silent without preexisting symptoms. Therefore, it is vital to develop public health measures that will help educate the community about the importance of recognizing the manifestation of various clinical conditions and the need to seek immediate clinical help. Furthermore, efforts should be made to make healthcare facilities accessible and affordable with adequate diagnostic and management capacity. Documentation of autopsy-based data could provide important epidemiological information to guide medical services, prevention efforts, and control measures.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic stress is a common trigger of multiple neuropsychiatric illnesses. Animal models are widely used to study stress-induced brain disorders and their interplay with neuroinflammation and other neuroimmune processes. Here, we apply the prolonged 12-week chronic unpredictable stress (PCUS) model to examine rat behavioral and hippocampal transcriptomic responses to stress and to chronic 4-week treatment with a classical antidepressant fluoxetine, an anti-inflammatory agent eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and their combinations. Overall, PCUS evoked anxiety-like behavioral phenotype in rats, corrected by chronic fluoxetine (alone or combined with other drugs), and EPA. PCUS also evoked pronounced transcriptomic responses in rat hippocampi, involving &gt; 200 differentially expressed genes. While pharmacological manipulations did not affect hippocampal gene expression markedly, <i>Gpr6</i>, <i>Drd2</i> and <i>Adora2a</i> were downregulated in stressed rats treated with fluoxetine, EPA and fluoxetine + EPA, suggesting their respective protein products (G protein-coupled receptor 6, dopamine D2 receptor and adenosine A2A receptor) as potential evolutionarily conserved targets under chronic stress. Overall, these findings support the validity of rat PCUS paradigm as a useful model to study stress-related anxiety pathogenesis, and call for further research probing how various conventional and novel drugs may (co)modulate behavioral and neurotranscriptomic biomarkers of chronic stress.</p>

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with over 7.8 million cases reported in the last five years. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, enabling more efficient and accurate diagnostic processes. Objective This study aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for early detection and classification of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. Methods The dataset, comprising 569 samples and 32 features derived from fine needle aspirate biopsy images, was pre-processed through data cleaning, normalization using the Robust Scaler, and feature selection. Five supervised ML algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were implemented. Models were evaluated using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. Results The SVC-RBF model demonstrated the highest accuracy (98.68%) and balanced performance across other metrics, making it the most effective classifier for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Key features such as texture mean and area (worst) significantly contributed to classification accuracy. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of ML algorithms, particularly SVC-RBF, to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics through improved accuracy and efficiency. Future research should validate these findings with diverse datasets and explore their integration into clinical workflows to enhance decision-making and patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-163/v1?src=rss">Recombinant expression of receptor binding domains of all eight subtypes of botulinum neurotoxin type A for generation of antitoxins with broad reactivity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) represents a major threat to global public health because of its most potent toxicity with the longest persistence. Several camelid single-domain antibodies (or VHHs) have been reported to exhibit high neutralizing activity against the receptor binding domain (HC) of the BoNT/A subtype used to generate them. However, it remains unclear if these VHHs can neutralize effectively HC of other BoNT/A subtypes. This study aimed to generate HC domains of all eight BoNT/A subtypes and to screen for VHHs with broad reactivity against these domains. Methods HC domains of BoNT/A1-A8 were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli. The bont/HCA1 fragment was amplified from sludge sample and cloned into pET45b vector by Gibson assembly. Expression vectors for HC domains of BoNT/A2-A8 were derived from pET45b-HCA1 by site-directed mutagenesis and/or in-house gene synthesis. Similarly, VHHs were synthesized and cloned into pET22b vector. Recombinant protein were purified by Ni-NTA spin columns and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ELISA was used to confirm the antigenicity of HC domains and to evaluate the reactivity of VHHs to these domains. Results SDS-PAGE analysis and ELISA results with commercial polyclonal antibody demonstrated the HC domains of all eight BoNT/A subtypes were correctly produced. ELISA results using a VHH panel indicated that, apart from ciA-C2, a well-characterized VHH specific for HC of BoNT/A1, two new VHHs were found to recognize the HC domains of all BoNT/A subtypes, of which VHH-A3 displayed EC50 values for these domains close to those of ciA-C2. Conclusion This study provided a resource to comprehensively identify antitoxins conferring broad protection against BoNT/A.
