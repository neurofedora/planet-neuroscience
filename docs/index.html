	<p>This study aims to assess oculomotor and vestibular endurance by utilizing the Oculomotor and Vestibular Endurance Screening (MoVES) assessment in athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; pre-season and post-season and after a suspected head injury to detect impairment. Athletes (N = 311, 19.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years) were recruited to perform the following seven tasks: (1) horizontal saccades, (2) vertical saccades, (3) vergence jumps, (4) horizontal vestibular-oculomotor reflex (VOR), (5) vertical VOR, (6) amplitude of accommodation (AoA), and (7) near point of convergence (NPC). At pre-season, the observed number of eye movements in 60 s are horizontal saccades (74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13 initial 30 s; 67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 latter 30 s), vertical saccades (70 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13; 66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10), vergence jumps (48 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12; 45 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13), horizontal VOR (38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11), and vertical VOR (8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11; 38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11). These results establish a normative database for eye movements within the MoVES assessment and show consistency in the number of movements from pre-season to post-season. The initial results show a trending decrease in the number of eye movements in the initial days post-head injury, which improves to pre-season measures 14&amp;amp;ndash;21 days post-injury. This foundation can be used by future studies to explore the extent of binocular and vestibular endurance dysfunctions caused by head injuries that subside within two weeks.</p>

<p>Ventral subiculum is shown to be involved in learning and memory and mediate affective behaviors. The present study demonstrated the critical role of ventral subiculum in maintaining arousal and sleep, as its lesion caused a profound disturbance of sleep–wake behaviors. Exposure to SPR reversed the VSL-induced alterations in sleep–wakefulness behavior.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ventral subiculum regulates emotion, stress responses, and spatial and social cognition. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated anxiety- and depression-like symptoms, deficits in spatial and social cognition in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rats, and restoration of affective and cognitive behaviors following photoperiod manipulation (short photoperiod regime, SPR; 6:18 LD cycle). In the present study, we have studied the impact of VSL on sleep–wake behavioral patterns and the effect of SPR on sleep–wakefulness behavior. Adult male Wistar rats subjected to VSL demonstrated decreased wake duration and enhanced total sleep time due to increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Power spectral analysis indicated increased delta activity during NREMS and decreased sigma band power during all vigilance states. Light is one of the strongest entrainers of the circadian rhythm, and its manipulation may have various physiological and functional consequences. We investigated the effect of 21-day exposure to SPR on sleep–wakefulness (S–W) behavior in VSL rats. We observed that SPR exposure restored S–W behavior in VSL rats, resulting in an increase in wake duration and a significant increase in theta power during wake and REMS. This study highlights the crucial role of the ventral subiculum in maintaining normal sleep–wakefulness patterns and highlights the effectiveness of photoperiod manipulation as a non-pharmacological treatment for reversing sleep disturbances reported in mood and neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which also involve alterations in circadian rhythm.</p>

                Tumor self-seeding is a process of circulating tumor cells recolonizing the primary tumor. Yang et al. develop a mouse model that recapitulates the spontaneous tumor self-seeding process and identifies tumor self-seeded cells (TSCs) highly expressing TM4SF1 with enhanced invasiveness and survival, providing cell targets with diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic potential.

                Han et al. demonstrate that KEAP1 serves as a key regulator of cellular metabolism. KEAP1 has a significant effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation by regulating HSPA9 ubiquitination and degradation. These results suggest that KEAP1 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer.

                Using patient-specific and CRISPR-Cas9-corrected iPSC cardiomyocytes, Busley et al. describe an LZTR1L580P-specific disease mechanism provoking Noonan syndrome-associated cardiac hypertrophy. Mutation-induced polymerization of LZTR1 complexes results in the accumulation of RAS GTPases, leading to molecular and cellular impairments associated with cardiac hypertrophy, whereas CRISPR correction of the missense variant rescues the disease phenotype.

                Sanz-Flores et al. generate mutant alleles for the two ubiquitous B55 isoforms (α and δ) of PP2A, which show overlapping roles in cell division and proliferation. Interestingly, they uncover a role for PP2A-B55 in the individualization of chromosomes during mitosis, which depends on Ki-67 phosphorylation and loading on the chromosome periphery.

                The superior colliculus (SC) is an evolutionary conserved sensory-motor region integrating multi-sensory information into specific spatial patterns of neuronal responses.

">Synchronous theta networks characterize successful memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval activates regions across the brain, including not only the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL), but also frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortical regions. How these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing, however, remains unclear. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3--8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 413 neurosurgical patients implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Network hubs, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. The recall accuracy network, derived from a correct recall--intrusion contrast, includes synchronous hubs concentrated in the temporal lobe and desynchronous hubs in the parietal lobe. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall--deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall--intrusion contrast, and theta power and synchrony positively correlate throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.

">Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention</a></h4>

              
                Across diverse organisms, the temporal dynamics of spiking responses between neurons, the neural synchrony, is crucial for encoding different stimuli. Neural synchrony is especially important in the insect antennal (olfactory) lobe (AL). Previous studies on synchronization, however, rely on pair-wise synchronization metrics including the cross-correlogram and cos-similarity between kernelized spikes train. These pair-wise analyses overlook an important aspect of synchronization which is the interaction at the population neuron level. There are also limited modeling techniques that incorporate the synchronization between neurons in modeling population spike trains. Inspired by recent advancements in machine learning, we leverage a modern attention mechanism to learn a generative normalizing flow that captures neuron population synchronization. Our method not only reveals the spiking mechanism of neurons in the AL region but also produces semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize neuron interactions over time. These automatically learned attention weights allow us to elucidate the known principles of neuron synchronization and further shed light on the functional roles of different cell types (the local interneurons (LNs), and projection neurons (PNs)) in the dynamic neural network in the AL. By varying the balance of excitation and inhibition in this neural circuit, our method further uncovers the pattern between the strength of synchronization and the ratio of an odorant in the mixture.

">From histology to macroscale function in the human amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a subcortical region in the mesiotemporal lobe that plays a key role in emotional and sensory functions. Conventional neuroimaging experiments treat this structure as a single, uniform entity, but there is ample histological evidence for subregional heterogeneity in microstructure and function. The current study characterized subregional structure-function coupling in the human amygdala, integrating post mortem histology and in vivo MRI at ultrahigh fields. Core to our work was a novel neuroinformatics approach that leveraged multiscale texture analysis as well as non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to identify salient dimensions of microstructural variation in a 3D post mortem histological reconstruction of the human amygdala. We observed two axes of subregional variation in the human amygdala, describing inferior-superior as well as medio-lateral trends in microstructural differentiation that in part recapitulated established atlases of amygdala subnuclei. We then translated our approach to in vivo MRI data acquired at 7 Tesla, and could demonstrate generalizability of these spatial trends across 10 healthy adults. We then cross-referenced microstructural axes with functional blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal analysis obtained during task-free conditions, and demonstrated a close association of structural axes with macroscale functional network embedding, notably the temporo-limbic, default mode, and sensory-motor networks. Our novel multiscale approach consolidates descriptions of amygdala anatomy and function obtained from histological and in vivo imaging techniques.

                Deriving human neural responses to natural speech is now possible, but the responses to male- and female-uttered speech have been shown to differ. These talker differences may complicate interpretations or restrict experimental designs geared toward more realistic communication scenarios. This study found that when a male and female talker had the same fundamental frequency, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were very similar. Those responses became smaller and later with increasing fundamental frequency, as did click ABRs with increasing stimulus rates. Modeled responses suggested that the speech and click ABR differences were reasonably predicted by peripheral and brainstem processing of stimulus acoustics.

">Enhancing Retrieval Capacity of the Predictive Brain through Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Intervention</a></h4>

              
                The ability to extract spatial or temporal regularities across experiences is crucial for skill development and predictive processes. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in modulating competitive memory systems, supporting declarative/episodic memory as opposed to statistical learning. This regulatory role may explain findings of improved acquisition and consolidation of statistical regularities following the suppression of dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This raises a key question: Is access to models and prior statistical knowledge also modulated by the DLPFC? This preregistered study provides new insights by examining the role of the DLPFC in retrieving pre-existing knowledge of temporally distributed statistical regularities. Using a probabilistic learning task, healthy participants engaged in implicit statistical learning for 25 minutes. After a 24-hour consolidation period, participants received either 1 Hz rTMS or sham stimulation over the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC for 10 minutes before retesting. We found more effective access to statistical regularities in the bilateral DLPFC group compared to the sham group. Our results suggest that DLPFC suppression enhances the retrieval of statistical knowledge, particularly when interhemispheric compensatory mechanisms are prevented. These findings contribute to understanding competitive memory systems and offer implications for cognitive enhancement strategies.

">Post-weaning social isolation alters sociability in a sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a critical period for brain development in humans and stress exposure during this time can have lasting effects on behavior and brain development. Social isolation and loneliness are particularly salient stressors that lead to detrimental mental health outcomes particularly in females, although most of the preclinical work on social isolation has been done in male animals. Our lab has developed a model of post-weaning adolescent social isolation that leads to increased drug reward sensitivity and altered neuronal structure in limbic brain regions. The current study utilized this model to determine the impact of adolescent social isolation on a three-chamber social interaction task both during adolescence and adulthood. We found that while post-weaning isolation does not alter social interaction during adolescence (PND45), it has sex-specific effects on social interaction in adulthood (PND60), potentiating social interaction in male mice and decreasing it in female mice. As early life stress can activate microglia leading to alterations in neuronal pruning, we next examined the impact of inhibiting microglial activation with daily minocycline administration during the first three weeks of social isolation on these changes in social interaction. During adolescence, minocycline dampened social interaction in male mice, while having no effect in females. In contrast, during adulthood, minocycline did not alter the impact of adolescent social isolation in males, with socially isolated males exhibiting higher levels of social interaction compared to their group housed counterparts. In females, adolescent minocycline treatment reversed the effect of social isolation leading to increased social interaction in the social isolation group, mimicking what is seen in naive males. Taken together, adolescent social isolation leads to sex-specific effects on social interaction in adulthood and adolescent minocycline treatment alters the effects of social isolation in females, but not males.

">HDAC4 Inhibits NMDA Receptor-Mediated Stimulation of Neurogranin Expression</a></h4>

              
                The coordination of neuronal wiring and activity within the central nervous system (CNS) is crucial for cognitive function, particularly in the context of aging and neurological disorders. Neurogranin (Ng), an abundant forebrain protein, modulates calmodulin (CaM) activity and deeply influences synaptic plasticity and neuronal processing. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms of Ng expression, a critical but underexplored area for combating cognitive impairment. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo hippocampal models, we show that Ng expression arises during late developmental stages, coinciding with synaptic maturation and neuronal circuit consolidation of. We observed that Ng expression increases in neuronal networks with heightened synaptic activity and identified GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as key drivers of this expression. Additionally, we discovered that nuclear-localized HDAC4 inhibits Ng expression, establishing a regulatory axis that is counteracted by NMDA receptor stimulation. Analysis of the Ng gene promoter activity revealed regulatory elements between the -2.4 and -0.85 Kbp region, including a binding site for RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST), which may mediate HDAC4 repressive effect on Ng expression. Further analysis of the promoter sequence revealed conserved binding sites for the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcription factor, a target of HDAC4-mediated transcription regulation. Our findings elucidate the interplay between synaptic activity, NMDAR function, and transcriptional regulation in controlling Ng expression, offering insights into synaptic plasticity mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies to prevent cognitive dysfunction.

">Engineering Microglial Cells to Promote Spinal Cord Injury Recovery</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in irreversible damage, leading to lifelong paralysis for affected individuals. Microglia's dual impact on neuronal regeneration after SCI, driven by their distinct roles at different stages, merits further study. We conducted a bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptomes (scRNA), spatial transcriptomic (ST) data, and bulk RNA-seq data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. The data were processed using R packages such as "Seurat", "DESeq2" ,limma; and "GSVA." Additionally, we utilized Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and the Enrichr web servers. Analysis of single-cell data and spatial transcriptomics has revealed notable changes in the microglial cell landscape in SCI. These changes encompass the inhibition of innate microglial cells, while reactive microglial cells exhibit pronounced reactive hyperplasia. Moreover, the TGFbeta signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the migration of innate microglial cells to enhance SCI recovery. However, reactive microglial cells exhibiting high Trem2 expression contribute to the neuroinflammatory response and can effectively modulate neural cell death in SCI. In particular, inhibiting Trem2 in reactive microglial cells not only reduces inflammation but also mitigates spinal cord injury, and enhancing the TGFbeta signaling pathway. What's more, the use of iPSC-derived microglial cells, which have demonstrated their capacity to augment the potential for replacing the functions of naive microglial cells, iPSC-derived microglia have the potential to replace the functions of naive microglial cells, holds significant promise in addressing SCI. Therefore, we posit that the engineering of microglial cells to promote the SCI recovery. The approach of inhibiting Trem2-mediated neuroinflammatory responses and transplanting iPSC-derived microglia with long-term TGFbeta stimulation may offer potential improvements in SCI recovery.

">Msh3 and Pms1 Set Neuronal CAG-repeat Migration Rate to Drive Selective Striatal and Cortical Pathogenesis in HD Mice</a></h4>

              
                Modifiers of Huntington disease (HD) include mismatch repair (MMR) genes; however, their underlying disease-altering mechanisms remain unresolved. Knockout (KO) alleles for 9 HD GWAS modifiers/MMR genes were crossed to the Q140 Huntingtin (mHtt) knock-in mice to probe such mechanisms. Four KO mice strongly (Msh3 and Pms1) or moderately (Msh2 and Mlh1) rescue a triad of adult-onset, striatal medium-spiny-neuron (MSN)-selective phenotypes: somatic Htt DNA CAG-repeat expansion, transcriptionopathy, and mHtt protein aggregation. Comparatively, Q140 cortex also exhibits an analogous, but later-onset, pathogenic triad that is Msh3-dependent. Remarkably, Q140/homozygous Msh3-KO lacks mHtt aggregates in the brain, even at advanced ages (20-months). Moreover, Msh3-deficiency prevents striatal synaptic marker loss, astrogliosis, and locomotor impairment in HD mice. Purified Q140 MSN nuclei exhibit highly linear age-dependent mHtt DNA repeat expansion (i.e. repeat migration), with modal-CAG increasing at +8.8 repeats/month (R2=0.98). This linear rate is reduced to 2.3 and 0.3 repeats/month in Q140 with Msh3 heterozygous and homozygous alleles, respectively. Our study defines somatic Htt CAG-repeat thresholds below which there are no mHtt nuclear (at 150-CAG) or neuropil aggregates (at 192-CAG). Mild transcriptionopathy can still occur in Q140 mice with stabilized Htt 140-CAG repeats, but the majority of transcriptomic changes are due to somatic repeat expansion. Our analysis reveals 479 genes with expression levels highly correlated with modal-CAG length in MSNs. Thus, our study mechanistically connects HD GWAS genes to selective neuronal vulnerability in HD, in which Msh3 and Pms1 set the linear rate of neuronal mHtt CAG-repeat migration to drive repeat-length dependent pathogenesis; and provides a preclinical platform for targeting these genes for HD suppression across brain regions.

">Mitigating sTNF/TNFR1 activation on VGluT2+ spinal cord interneurons improves immune function after mid-thoracic spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury, SCI, is a devastating condition with 250,000 to 500,000 new cases globally each year. Respiratory infections, e.g., pneumonia and influenza are the leading cause of death after SCI.Unfortunately, there is a poor understanding of how altered neuro-immune communication impacts an individuals outcome to infection. In humans and rodents, SCI leads to maladaptive changes in the spinal-sympathetic reflex, SSR, circuit which is crucial to sympathetic function. The cause of the impaired immune function may be related to harmful neuroinflammation which is detrimental to homeostasis neuronal function, aberrant plasticity, and hyper excitable circuits. Soluble tumor necrosis factor, sTNF, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in the CNS after SCI and remains elevated for several months after injury. By pharmacologically attenuating sTNF in the CNS after SCI we were able to demonstrate improved immune function. Furthermore, when we investigated the specific cellular population which may be involved in altered neuro-immune communication we reported that excessive TNFR1 activity on excitatory INs promotes immune dysfunction. Furthermore, this observation is NF-kB dependent in VGluT2+ INs. Our data is the first report of a target within the CNS, TNFR1, that contributes to SCI-induced immune dysfunction after T9-SCI and is a potential avenue for future therapeutics.

">Sulfonylurea receptor coupled conductances alter the performance of two central pattern generating circuits in Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity and energy supply must maintain a fine balance for neuronal fitness. Various channels of communication between the two could impact network output in different ways. Sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) are a modification of ATP-binding cassette proteins (ABCs) that confer ATP-dependent gating on their associated ion channels. They are widely expressed and link metabolic states directly to neuronal activity. The role they play varies in different circuits, both enabling bursting and inhibiting activity in pathological conditions. The crab, Cancer borealis, has central patterns generators (CPGs) that fire in rhythmic bursts nearly constantly and it is unknown how energy availability influences these networks. The pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and cardiac ganglion (GC) control rhythmic contractions of the foregut and heart respectively. Pharmacological manipulation of SURs results in opposite effects in the two CPGs. Neuronal firing completely stops in the STG when SUR-associated channels are open, and firing increases when the channels are closed. This results from a decrease in the excitability of pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, which are a part of the pacemaker kernel. The neurons of the CG, paradoxically, increase firing within bursts when SUR-associated channels are opened, and bursting slows when SUR-associated channels are closed. The channel permeability and sensitivities analyses present novel SUR-conductance biophysics, which nevertheless change activity in ways reminiscent of the predominantly studied mammalian receptor/channels. We suggest that SUR-associated conductances allow different neurons to respond to energy states in different ways through a common mechanism.

">Influence of asymmetric microchannels in the structure and function of engineered neuronal circuits</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the intricate structure-function relationships of neuronal circuits is crucial for unraveling how the brain sustains efficient information transfer. In specific brain regions, like the hippocampus, neurons are organized in layers and form unidirectional connectivity, which is thought to help ensure controlled signal flow and information processing. In recent years, researchers have tried emulating these structural principles by providing cultured neurons with asymmetric environmental cues, namely microfluidics' microchannels that promote directed axonal growth. Even though a few reports have claimed achieving unidirectional connectivity of in vitro neuronal circuits, given the lack of functional characterization, whether this structural connectivity correlates with functional connectivity remains unknown. We have replicated and tested the performance of asymmetric microchannel designs previously reported in the literature to be successful in the promotion of directed axonal growth, as well as other custom variations. A new variation of "Arrowhead", termed "Rams", was the best-performing motif with a ~76% probability per microchannel of allowing strictly unidirectional connections at 14 days in vitro. Importantly, we assessed the functional implications of these different asymmetric microchannel designs. For this purpose, we combined custom microfluidics with microelectrode array (MEA) technology to record the electrophysiological activity of two segregated populations of hippocampal neurons ("Source" and "Target"). This functional characterization revealed that up to ~94% of the spiking activity recorded along microchannels with the "Rams" motif propagates towards the "Target" population. Moreover, our results indicate that these engineered circuits also tended to exhibit network-level synchronizations with defined directionality. Overall, this characterization of the structure-function relationships promoted by asymmetric microchannels has the potential to provide insights into how neuronal circuits use specific network architectures for effective computations. Moreover, the here-developed devices and approaches may be used in a wide range of applications, such as disease modeling or preclinical drug screening.

">Chronic β3 adrenergic agonist treatment improves brain microvascular                   endothelial function and cognition in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Microvascular endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired neurovascular coupling, reduced glucose uptake, blood-brain barrier disruption, and microvascular rarefaction, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of age-related vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Emerging evidence points to non-cell autonomous mechanisms mediated by adverse circulating milieu (an increased ratio of pro-geronic to anti-geronic circulating factors) in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction leading to impaired cerebral blood flow and cognitive decline in the aging population. In particular, age-related adipose dysfunction contributes, at least in part, to an unfavorable systemic milieu characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and altered adipokine profile, which together contribute to microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to test whether thermogenic stimulation, an intervention known to improve adipose and systemic metabolism by increasing cellular energy expenditure, could mitigate brain endothelial dysfunction and improve cognition in the aging population. Eighteen-month-old old C57BL/6J mice were treated with saline or CL ({beta}3-adrenergic agonist) for 6 weeks followed by functional analysis to assess endothelial function and cognition. CL treatment improved neurovascular coupling responses and rescued brain glucose uptake in aged animals. In addition, CL treatment also attenuated blood-brain barrier leakage and associated neuroinflammation in the cortex of aged animals. More importantly, these beneficial changes in microvascular function translated to improved cognitive performance in radial arm water maze and Y-maze tests. Our results suggest that {beta}3-adrenergic agonist treatment improves multiple aspects of brain microvascular endothelial function and can be potentially repurposed for treating age-associated cognitive decline.

">Ultraslow serotonin oscillations in the hippocampus delineate substates across NREM and waking</a></h4>

              
                Beyond the vast array of functional roles attributed to serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, changes in 5-HT levels have been shown to accompany changes in behavioral states, including WAKE, NREM and REM sleep. Whether 5-HT dynamics at shorter time scales can be seen to delineate substates within these larger brain states remains an open question. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of extracellular 5-HT using a recently-developed G Protein-Coupled Receptor-Activation-Based 5-HT sensor (GRAB5-HT3.0) and local field potential (LFP) in the hippocampal CA1, which revealed the presence of prominent ultraslow (<0.05 Hz) 5-HT oscillations both during NREM and WAKE states. Interestingly, the phase of these ultraslow 5-HT oscillations was found to distinguish substates both within and across larger behavioral states. Hippocampal ripples occurred preferentially on the falling phase of ultraslow 5-HT oscillations during both NREM and WAKE, with higher power ripples concentrating near the peak specifically during NREM. By contrast, hippocampal-cortical coherence was strongest and microarousals and EMG peaks were most prevalent during the rising phase in both wake and NREM. Overall, ultraslow 5-HT oscillations delineate substates within the larger behavioral states of NREM and WAKE, thus potentially temporally segregating internal memory consolidation processes from arousal-related functions.

">On the validity of electric brain signal predictions based on population firing rates</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity at the population level is commonly studied experimentally through measurements of electric brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs), or electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To allow for comparison between observed and simulated neural activity it is therefore important that simulations of neural activity can accurately predict these brain signals. Simulations of neural activity at the population level often rely on point-neuron network models or firing-rate models. While these simplified representations of neural activity are computationally efficient, they lack the explicit spatial information needed for calculating LFP/EEG signals. Different heuristic approaches have been suggested for overcoming this limitation, but the accuracy of these approaches has not fully been assessed. One such heuristic approach, the so-called kernel method, has previously been applied with promising results and has the additional advantage of being well-grounded in the biophysics underlying electric brain signal generation. It is based on calculating rate-to-LFP/EEG kernels for each synaptic pathway in a network model, after which LFP/EEG signals can be obtained directly from population firing rates. This amounts to a massive reduction in the computational effort of calculating brain signals because the brain signals are calculated for each population instead of for each neuron. Here, we investigate how and when the kernel method can be expected to work, and present a theoretical framework for predicting its accuracy. We show that the relative error of the brain signal predictions is a function of the single-cell kernel heterogeneity and the spike-train correlations. Finally, we demonstrate that the kernel method is most accurate for the dominating brain signal contributions. We thereby further establish the kernel method as a promising approach for calculating electric brain signals from large-scale neural simulations.

">"Micro-offline gains" convey no benefit for motor skill learning</a></h4>

              
                While practising a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement has been interpreted as rapid offline learning1,2 ('micro-offline gains', MOG), supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest3. Here, we provide evidence that MOG reflect transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not replay-mediated offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible during fixed-duration practice periods. When participants trained during 10-second practice periods, each followed by a 10-second rest period, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after the end of training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOG reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, sequence-specific replay was not necessary for MOG, given that we observed persistent MOG when participants produced sequences that never repeated, preventing any effect of (sequence-specific) replay on the performance of subsequent (novel) sequences. Importantly, we observed diminished MOG when participants could not pre-plan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. We conclude that 'micro-offline gains' represent short-lived performance benefits that are partially driven by motor pre-planning, rather than replay-mediated offline learning.

">A systematic evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity methods using simulation data</a></h4>

              
                Numerous dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) methods have been proposed to study time-resolved network reorganization in rest and task fMRI. However, a comprehensive comparison of their performance is lacking. In this study, we compared the efficacy of seven dFC methods (and their enhanced versions) to track transient network reconfiguration using simulation data. The seven methods include flexible least squares (FLS), dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), general linear Kalman filter (GLKF), multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD), sliding-window functional connectivity with L1-regularization (SWFC), hidden Markov models (HMM), and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM). Multiple datasets of non-fMRI-BOLD and fMRI-BOLD signals with predefined covariance structures, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and sojourn time distributions were simulated. We adopted inter-subject analysis to eliminate the effects of signals of non-interest, resulting in enhanced methods: ISSWFC, ISMTD, ISDCC, ISFLS, ISKF, ISHMM, and ISHSMM. Efficacy was defined as the spatiotemporal association between simulated and estimated data. We found that all enhanced dFC methods outperformed their original versions. Efficacies depend on several factors, such as considering the neurovascular effect in simulated data, the covariance structure between two time series, state sojourn distribution, and signal-to-noise ratio levels. These results highlight the importance of selecting appropriate dFC methods in fMRI study.

">Exploring For Gloss: The Role of Active Exploration in Visual Material Perception</a></h4>

              
                Image motion has been found to contribute to the perception of visual material properties, and motion signals are generated while actively exploring objects. Yet, little is known about the specific visual cues produced through exploration and how exploration, in turn, impacts visual material perception. Using virtual reality and real-time hand tracking, we investigated the influence of material on exploratory hand motion and vice versa. Participants either observed or actively explored objects varying in gloss or in lightness while performing a matching task. We compared the perceptual judgments of actively exploring and observing participants and analysed their manual exploration patterns during the two material judgment tasks in the interactive condition. Results showed systematic variation in exploration patterns based on visual task and material property: participants spent more time exploring objects when judging gloss than when judging lightness, and glossier objects were explored longer. This increased exploration during gloss judgments could suggest a strategic prioritisation of relevant cues for gloss judgments, with observers actively generating highlight movements through larger movements and object rotation to facilitate their gloss judgements. Our study demonstrates that visual material properties impact how individuals interact with objects, and that active exploration influences the perception of visual material properties.

">Identification of whole-body reaching movement phenotypes in young and older active adults: an unsupervised machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Studies reported age-related motor control modifications in whole-body movement in several aspects of spatiotemporal movement organization by comparing young and older adults. However, studies on motor control involve high complexity and high-dimensional data of different natures, in which machine learning has proved to be effective. Furthermore, conventional studies focus on comparisons of movement parameters based on a priori grouping, whereas unsupervised machine learning allows the identification of inherent groupings within the dataset. The current investigation was carried out by using the unsupervised machine learning on motor control features across age-groups. An important question was whether we could identify different movement patterns based on motor control features and whether they were age-dependent or independent. We investigated motor control parameters variations in a whole-body reaching movement across young and active older adults including woman and man (n=19). We applied the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the kinematic data (21 features) of all individuals. We propose a methodology applying the latest recommendations for clustering methods in the field of whole-body movement motor control. Analysis revealed two distinct motor control patterns which were age independent. The first pattern exhibited higher shoulder, ankle and knee angular excursions, along with a higher vertical velocity of center of mass (CoM), compared to the second pattern, which had higher hip and back angular excursions, along with a lower vertical velocity CoM. The clustering methodology demonstrated its effectiveness to identify distinct motor patterns based solely on motor control features independently of age-grouping.

">Taming a behavioral monster: Resonant song recognition and the evolution of acoustic communication in crickets</a></h4>

              
                Rare behavioral phenotypes---behavioral monsters---can challenge hypotheses about the evolution of the neural networks that drive behavior. In crickets, the diversity of song recognition behaviors is thought to be based on the modification of a shared neural network. We here report on a cricket with a novel resonant song recognition pattern that challenges this hypothesis. Females of the species Anurogryllus muticus respond to pulse patterns with the period of the male song, but also to song at twice the period. To identify the mechanisms underlying this multi-peaked recognition, we first explored minimal models of resonant behaviors. Though all of the three simple models tested (autocorrelation, rebound, resonate and fire) produced some kind of resonant behavior, only a single-neuron model with an oscillating membrane qualitatively matched the Anurogryllus behavior with regard to both period and duty cycle tuning. Surprisingly, the rebound model, a minimal model of the core mechanism for song recognition in crickets, fails to reproduce the preference for higher duty cycles observed in the behavior, questioning the universality of the core algorithm. However, the behavior is reproduced with a network model that contains all computations from the song recognition network of crickets, revealing the importance of an additional computation not part of the core mechanism: Following the core rebound mechanism in which post-inhibitory rebounds give rise to the resonant period tuning, feed-forward inhibition further shapes the tuning, resulting in the observed behavioral profile. Overall, this shows how unusual behavioral phenotypes can evolve by combining different nonlinear computations at the level of single cells and networks.

">Loss of the lysosomal lipid flippase ATP10B leads to progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Parkinsonian motor deficits</a></h4>

              
                Background ATP10B, a transmembrane lipid flippase located in late endosomes and lysosomes, facilitates the export of glucosylceramide and phosphatidylcholine by coupling this process to ATP hydrolysis. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the ATP10B gene have been identified in Parkinsons disease patients, pointing to ATP10B as a candidate genetic risk factor. Previous studies have shown compromised lysosomal functionality upon ATP10B knockdown in human cell lines and primary cortical neurons. However, its role in vivo and specifically in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system remains poorly understood. Methods To investigate the role ATP10B in PD neuropathology, we induced ATP10B knockdown specifically in substantia nigra pars compacta neurons of rats using viral vector technology. Two different microRNA-based shRNA constructs targeting distinct regions of the ATP10B mRNA were used to cross-validate the findings. Behavioral evaluation, dopamine transporter 18F-FE-PE2I positron emission tomography imaging and neuropathological examination of the nigrostriatal pathway at one year post-injection were conducted. Additionally, midbrain neuronal cultures derived from ATP10B knock-out human induced pluripotent stem cells clones were used to study the impact of ATP10B loss in dopaminergic neurons in a more translational model. Results ATP10B knockdown in rat brain induced Parkinsonian motor deficits, and longitudinal striatal dopamine transporter 18F-FE-PE2I PET imaging revealed a progressive decrease in binding potential. Immunohistochemical analysis conducted one year post-injection confirmed the loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum, alongside a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The expression of LAMP1, LAMP2a, cathepsin B and glucocerebrosidase was studied by immunofluorescence in the surviving dopaminergic neurons. A decrease in lysosomal numbers and an increase in lysosomal volume were observed more consistently in one of the knockdown constructs. The vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to ATP10B loss-of-function was also observed in midbrain neuronal cultures derived from ATP10B knock-out human induced pluripotent stem cells clones, which showed a significant reduction in TH-positive neurons. Conclusion Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ATP10B depletion detrimentally impacts the viability of dopaminergic neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, a broader impact on the functionality of the nigrostriatal pathway was evidenced as rats with ATP10B knockdown exhibited motor impairments similar to those observed in PD patients.

">Microglia-specific transduction via AAV11 armed with IBA1 promoter and miRNA-9 targeting sequences</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, as resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are closely related to human health and the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases, making them compelling targets for therapeutic interventions. However, functional and therapeutic studies of microglia remain significant challenges largely due to the lack of tools capable of efficiently and specifically transducing microglia. Herein, we evaluated the specificity and efficiency of various adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors armed with the mIBA1 promoter and miRNA-9 targeting sequences in transducing microglia within the caudate putamen (CPu) brain region, and found that AAV11 mediates more specific and efficient transduction of microglia. Subsequently, we further demonstrated that AAV11 also exhibits high transduction specificity for microglia across various brain areas and within the spinal cord. Finally, by reducing the injection dosage, we employed AAV11 for sparse labeling of microglia. This work provides a promising tool for advancing both the functional investigation and therapeutic targeting of microglia.

">The neurovascular coupling response of the aged brain is brain-state dependent.</a></h4>

              
                Brain aging lead to reduced cerebral blood flow and cognitive decline, but how normal aging affects neurovascular coupling (NVC) in the awake brain is unclear. Here, we investigated NVC in relation to calcium changes in vascular mural cells (VMCs) in awake adult and aged mice. We show that NVC responses are reduced and prolonged in the aged brain and that this is more pronounced at the capillary level than in arterioles. However, the overall NVC response, measured as the time integral of vasodilation, is the same in two age groups. In adult, but not in aged mice, the NVC response correlated with Ca2+ signaling in VMCs, while the overall Ca2+ kinetics were slower in aged than in adult mice. In particular, the rate of Ca2+ transport, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of VMCs were reduced in aged mice, explaining the reduced and prolonged vasodilation. Spontaneous locomotion was less frequent and reduced in aged mice as compared to young adult mice, and this was reflected in the 'slow but prolonged' NVC and vascular Ca2+ responses. Taken together, our data characterize the NVC in the aged awake brain as slow but prolonged, and underscoring the importance of brain state in understanding age-related mechanisms.

">Transient cortical Beta-frequency oscillations associated with contextual novelty in high density mouse EEG</a></h4>

              
                Beta-frequency oscillations (20-30 Hz) are prominent in both human and rodent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Discrete epochs of beta (or Beta2) oscillations are prevalent in the hippocampus and other brain areas during exploration of novel environments. However, little is known about the spatial distribution and temporal relationships of beta oscillations across the cortex in response to novelty. To investigate this, mice fitted with 30-channel EEG-style multi-electrode arrays underwent a single recording session in a novel environment. While changes to spectral properties of cortical oscillations were minimal, there was a profound increase in the rate of beta bursts during the initial part of the recording session, when the environment was most novel. This was true across the cortex but most notable in recording channels situated above the retrosplenial cortex. Additionally, novelty was associated with greater connectivity between retrosplenial areas and the rest of the cortex, specifically in the beta frequency range. However, it was also found that the cortex in general, is highly modulated by environmental novelty. This data further suggests the retrosplenial cortex is an important hub for distinguishing environmental context and highlights the diversity of functions for beta oscillations across the brain, which can be observed using high-density EEG.

">Synergistic reinforcement learning by cooperation of the cerebellum and basal ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia play a central role in flexible learning in mammals. However, how these three structures work together is not fully understood. Recently, it has been suggested that reinforcement learning may be implemented not only in the basal ganglia but also in the cerebellum, as the activity of cerebellar climbing fibers represents reward prediction error. If the same learning mechanism via reward prediction error occurs simultaneously in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, it remains unclear how these two regions co-function. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the output of cerebellum and basal ganglia, the cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata, respectively, from ChR2 transgenic rats with high-density Neuropixels probes while optogenetically stimulating the cerebral cortex point-by-point. The temporal response patterns could be categorized into two classes in both cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Among them, the fast excitatory response of the cerebellar nuclei due to the input of mossy fibers and the inhibitory response of the substantia nigra pars reticulata via the direct pathway were synchronized. This coincidence, reproduced in a spiking network simulation based on connectome data, was expected to synchronously activate the cerebral cortex via the thalamus. To further investigate the significance of this synchronous positive feedback, we constructed a reservoir model that mimics the time course of the activity dynamics of cerebral cortex and temporal responses of cerebellar nuclei and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Plasticity of both parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cell and corticostriatal synapses onto the striatal neurons of the direct pathway was essential for successful learning of a reinforcement learning task. Notably, learning was inhibited when the timing of the cerebellar or basal ganglia output was delayed from the real data by 10 ms; the larger this delay, the slower the learning rate. This necessary temporal precision was observed only when the cerebral cortex operated in the {beta}-to-{gamma} frequency range. These results indicate that coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, with input from the cerebral cortex in a narrow frequency band, facilitates brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning. Thus, our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of the interactions among the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex.

">Exploring Anatomical Links Between the Crow's Nidopallium Caudolaterale and its Song System</a></h4>

              
                Crows are corvid songbirds that exhibit remarkable cognitive control over their actions, including their vocalizations. They can learn to vocalize on command and the activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal skilled behaviors. However, it remains unknown if specific anatomical adaptations that directly link the crow NCL to any of the nuclei of the crow's 'song system' exist. To address this issue, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods (Nissl-, myelin-, and anti tyrosine hydroxylase) to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system nuclei. We found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to and engulfing the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), which is the telencephalic motor output of the song system. Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum surrounding the basal ganglia song nucleus 'area X'. Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections - MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC - run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a 'general motor system' that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.

">A conserved code for anatomy: Neurons throughout the brain embed robust signatures of their anatomical location into spike trains.</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain are known to encode diverse information through their spiking activity, primarily reflecting external stimuli and internal states. However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuron's anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.

">Inferring illness causes recruits the animacy semantic network</a></h4>

              
                Inferring the causes of illness is universal across human cultures and is essential for survival. Here we use this phenomenon as a test case for understanding the neural basis of implicit causal inference. Participants (n=20) undergoing fMRI read two-sentence vignettes that encouraged them to make causal inferences about illness or mechanical failure (causal control) as well as non-causal vignettes. All vignettes were about people and were matched on linguistic variables. The same participants performed localizers: language, logical reasoning, and mentalizing. Inferring illness causes selectively engaged a portion of precuneus (PC) previously implicated in the semantic representation of animates (e.g., people, animals). This region was near but not the same as PC responses to mental states, suggesting a neural mind/body distinction. No cortical areas responded to causal inferences across domains (i.e., illness, mechanical), including in individually localized language and logical reasoning networks. Together, these findings suggest that implicit causal inferences are supported by content-specific semantic networks that encode causal knowledge.

	<p>Several therapies have been developed to reduce cognitive decline associated with aging. Aquatic exercises, which are widely used to enhance functional capacity, may play a role in stimulating cognitive functions. This study investigated the effects of a 3-month aquatic exercise program on cognitive functions in community-dwelling older adults. In this prospective, single-blinded, controlled clinical trial, 31 participants were allocated to either the experimental (aquatic exercises) or control (no-exercise) group. The intervention program consisted of exercises conducted twice a week in a 1.2 m deep indoor pool. The main outcome measures were cognitive functions, assessed using Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to assess the impact of the exercise program. The effect sizes (&amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p) were reported when a level of significance was achieved (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, the participants who underwent aquatic exercises showed positive outcomes in Raven&amp;amp;rsquo;s Progressive Matrices test (p = 0.046; &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.131) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.589). Complementary analyses of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test indicated that the benefits of the aquatic exercise were observed in terms of the number of trials (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.478), number of errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.458), and number of non-perseverative errors (p = 0.001, &amp;amp;eta;&amp;amp;sup2;p = 0.302). The results indicate that a period of three months of aquatic exercise was beneficial for stimulating specific aspects of the cognitive function of community-dwelling older individuals. Aquatic exercise should be prescribed to this population.</p>

	<p>In the pediatric population, epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that often results in cognitive dysfunction. It affects patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life quality by limiting academic performance and self-esteem and increasing social rejection. There are several interventions for the neurohabilitation of cognitive impairment, including LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy (LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T), which promotes neuronal connectivity and cortical plasticity through the use of assembly sets and robotic programming. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T on cognitive processes in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Eligible patients were identified; in the treatment group, an initial evaluation was performed with the NEUROPSI and BANFE-2 neuropsychological tests. Then, the interventions were performed once a week, and a final test was performed. In the control group, after the initial evaluation, the final evaluation was performed. An overall improvement was observed in the LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T patients, with a significant increase in BANFE-2 scores in the orbitomedial, anterior prefrontal, and dorsolateral areas. In addition, in the gain score analysis, the orbitomedial and memory scores were significantly different from the control group. LEGO&amp;amp;reg; B-T neurohabilitation is a remarkable option for epilepsy patients, who are motivated when they observe improvements.</p>

	<p>Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) display many cognitive and physiological alterations resulting from renal failure and physical inactivity. Caffeine intake has been reported to improve cognitive/physical performance in several studies. However, whether the benefits of caffeine intake apply to patients with ESRD remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of caffeine intake on postural balance, cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD. In a randomized order, 12 patients with ESRD (age: 33.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 8.57 years; Female: 45.5%) performed a battery of tests after either caffeine (CF) (400 mg) or placebo (PLA) ingestion. Postural balance was evaluated using a stabilometric platform. Functional capacity was assessed with the sit-to-stand and up-and-go tests, and for cognitive performances, reaction time test and a vigilance test were used. Results showed a significant improvement in up-and-go test (p = 0.01) and sit-to-stand test performances with CF compared to PLA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Time of reaction test and vigilance test (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) performances were significantly higher with CF. No significant difference was observed in postural balance between CF and PLA. The results of this study suggest that acute caffeine ingestion positively enhances cognitive function and functional capacity in patients with ESRD.</p>

                Abstract* Background The level of liver fibrosis is the basis for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and it is necessary to adapt non-invasive liver fibrosis modalities. We aimed to investigate the use of M2BPGi as a single or combined diagnostic modality for liver fibrosis in CHB patients through a stepwise diagnostic analysis. Methods Cross-sectional data were taken from patients between October 2021 and August 2022. Demographic data, blood profile, liver function, and liver stiffness were measured in CHB patients over 18 years old, willing to take part in the research, and had complete data. APRI, FIB-4, and AAR were calculated using the well-known formulas. Serum M2BPGi-levels were converted into a cut-off index (COI). The patients were divided into low-risk (LR) and high-risk fibrosis (HR) groups. A cut-off for each predictor variable to differentiate between the LR and HR groups was determined. The obtained cut-off was assessed for its association with the grouping of liver elastography results. Models to diagnose the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥8 kPa were created and compared through multivariate and ROC analyses. Results The number of patients that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was 143 (HR = 65, LR = 78). The cut-off for diagnosing LSM ≥8kPa was 0.311, 0.742, 0.635, and 1.434 for APRI, FIB-4, AAR, and M2BPGi, respectively. This cut-off was significantly associated with the results of the HR and LR groupings. A multivariate analysis found that FIB4, AAR, and M2BPGi added significantly to the model. Statistically, the most optimal use of M2BPGi was combined with FIB-4, with an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions The optimal cut-off of M2BPGi for diagnosing high-risk liver fibrosis in this study was 1.434. M2BPGi should be used with FIB-4 as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing liver fibrosis, especially in the absence of a liver biopsy or elastography.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. <i>In vitro</i> TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of <i>in vitro</i> models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

Emerging infectious diseases with zoonotic potential often have complex socioecological dynamics and limited ecological data, requiring integration of epidemiological modeling with surveillance. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has advanced considerably since its detection in late 2019, the factors influencing its introduction and transmission in wildlife hosts, particularly white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), remain poorly understood. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible epidemiological model to investigate the spillover risk and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in wild and captive white-tailed deer populations across various simulated scenarios. We found that captive scenarios pose a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 introduction from humans into deer herds and subsequent transmission among deer, compared to wild herds. However, even in wild herds, the transmission risk is often substantial enough to sustain infections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of introduction from humans influences outbreak characteristics only to a certain extent. Transmission among deer was frequently sufficient for widespread outbreaks in deer populations, regardless of the initial level of introduction. We also explore the potential for fence line interactions between captive and wild deer to elevate outbreak metrics in wild herds that have the lowest risk of introduction and sustained transmission. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be introduced and maintained in deer herds across a range of circumstances based on testing a range of introduction and transmission risks in various captive and wild scenarios. Our approach and findings will aid One Health strategies that mitigate persistent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in white-tailed deer populations and potential spillback to humans.

                <p>by Pascal Grobecker, Thomas Sakoparnig, Erik van Nimwegen</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a popular experimental method to study variation of gene expression within a population of cells. However, obtaining an accurate picture of the diversity of distinct gene expression states that are present in a given dataset is highly challenging because the sparsity of the scRNA-seq data and its inhomogeneous measurement noise properties. Although a vast number of different methods is applied in the literature for clustering cells into subsets with ‘similar’ expression profiles, these methods generally lack rigorously specified objectives, involve multiple complex layers of normalization, filtering, feature selection, dimensionality-reduction, employ <i>ad hoc</i> measures of distance or similarity between cells, often ignore the known measurement noise properties of scRNA-seq measurements, and include a large number of tunable parameters. Consequently, it is virtually impossible to assign concrete biophysical meaning to the clusterings that result from these methods. Here we address the following problem: Given raw unique molecule identifier (UMI) counts of an scRNA-seq dataset, partition the cells into subsets such that the gene expression states of the cells in each subset are statistically indistinguishable, and each subset corresponds to a distinct gene expression state. That is, we aim to partition cells so as to maximally reduce the complexity of the dataset without removing any of its meaningful structure. We show that, given the known measurement noise structure of scRNA-seq data, this problem is mathematically well-defined and derive its unique solution from first principles. We have implemented this solution in a tool called Cellstates which operates directly on the raw data and automatically determines the optimal partition and cluster number, with zero tunable parameters. We show that, on synthetic datasets, Cellstates almost perfectly recovers optimal partitions. On real data, Cellstates robustly identifies subtle substructure within groups of cells that are traditionally annotated as a common cell type. Moreover, we show that the diversity of gene expression states that Cellstates identifies systematically depends on the tissue of origin and not on technical features of the experiments such as the total number of cells and total UMI count per cell. In addition to the Cellstates tool we also provide a small toolbox of software to place the identified cellstates into a hierarchical tree of higher-order clusters, to identify the most important differentially expressed genes at each branch of this hierarchy, and to visualize these results.

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves has been used in various pathological contexts for rehabilitation purposes or to alleviate the symptoms of neuropathologies, thus improving the overall quality of life of patients. However, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is still a challenging issue requiring extensive <i>in vivo</i> experimental campaigns and technical development. To facilitate the design of new stimulation strategies, we provide a fully open source and self-contained software framework for the <i>in silico</i> evaluation of peripheral nerve electrical stimulation. Our modeling approach, developed in the popular and well-established Python language, uses an object-oriented paradigm to map the physiological and electrical context. The framework is designed to facilitate multi-scale analysis, from single fiber stimulation to whole multifascicular nerves. It also allows the simulation of complex strategies such as multiple electrode combinations and waveforms ranging from conventional biphasic pulses to more complex modulated kHz stimuli. In addition, we provide automated support for stimulation strategy optimization and handle the computational backend transparently to the user. Our framework has been extensively tested and validated with several existing results in the literature.

                <p>by Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Monja Isabel Froböse, Alfons Schnitzler, Elisabeth Schreivogel, Gerhard Jocham</p>

In everyday life, we encounter situations that require tradeoffs between potential rewards and associated costs, such as time and (physical) effort. The literature indicates a prominent role for dopamine in discounting of both delay and effort, with mixed findings for delay discounting in humans. Moreover, the reciprocal antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic transmission in the striatum suggests a potential opponent role of acetylcholine in these processes. We found opposing effects of dopamine D2 (haloperidol) and acetylcholine M1 receptor (biperiden) antagonism on specific components of effort-based decision-making in healthy humans: haloperidol decreased, whereas biperiden increased the willingness to exert physical effort. In contrast, delay discounting was reduced under haloperidol, but not affected by biperiden. Together, our data suggest that dopamine, acting at D2 receptors, modulates both effort and delay discounting, while acetylcholine, acting at M1 receptors, appears to exert a more specific influence on effort discounting only.

Glial cells such as astrocytes can modulate neuronal signaling. Astrocytes can also acquire a reactive phenotype that correlates with cognitive impairments in brain diseases. A study in PLOS Biology shows that prolonged activation of astrocytes can trigger both cognitive impairments and a reactive astrocyte phenotype.

                <p>by Kun Cui, Xuetao Qi, Zilong Liu, Weiqi Sun, Peijie Jiao, Chang Liu, Jifu Tong, Xiaoyan Sun, Haojie Sun, Su Fu, Jiaxin Wang, Yawen Zheng, Tianyu Liu, Shuang Cui, Fengyu Liu, Jian Mao, Jie Zheng, You Wan, Ming Yi</p>

Over-generalized fear is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. The dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) contains engram cells that play a crucial role in accurate memory retrieval. However, the coordination mechanism of neuronal subpopulations within the dDG network during fear generalization is not well understood. Here, with the Tet-off system combined with immunostaining and two-photon calcium imaging, we report that dDG fear engram cells labeled in the conditioned context constitutes a significantly higher proportion of dDG neurons activated in a similar context where mice show generalized fear. The activation of these dDG fear engram cells encoding the conditioned context is both sufficient and necessary for inducing fear generalization in the similar context. Activities of mossy cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vMCs) are significantly suppressed in mice showing fear generalization in a similar context, and activating the vMCs-dDG pathway suppresses generalized but not conditioned fear. Finally, modifying fear memory engrams in the dDG with “safety” signals effectively rescues fear generalization. These findings reveal that the competitive advantage of dDG engram cells underlies fear generalization, which can be rescued by activating the vMCs-dDG pathway or modifying fear memory engrams, and provide novel insights into the dDG network as the neuronal basis of fear generalization.

                Background Currently there are 1.3 billion adolescents worldwide, which makes up 16% of the world population. Over 20% of adolescents around the world are thought to have behavioural or mental health issues. Addressing mental health issues is very important for the promotion of positive health in adolescents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among adolescents in urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 350 adolescents aged 16 to 19 years each from urban and rural areas of Shivamogga. Results Depression, anxiety and stress were found to be 23.1%, 29.4% and 26.6% in urban areas and 19.1%, 24% and 21.1% in rural areas respectively. Depression was more common among females in both urban and rural settings, with a significant difference observed in rural areas. Anxiety and stress were also more prevalent among females, with anxiety significantly higher in urban females. Urban adolescents exhibited higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their rural counterparts. Conclusions About a quarter of the adolescent population suffers from depression anxiety and stress. Adopting and implementing better education and health policies are necessary to enhance adolescent mental health.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28 % of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

                Background: Breast milk is a critical element in developing a baby’s immunity through immune transfer. Antibodies are an essential unit of immunity against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper explores antibodies in breast milk in postpartum women who have been vaccinated or exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Duration of antibody appearance was studied to determine the adequate time in transferring antibodies by breastfeeding. Methods: Three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, were used as sources of articles. Inclusion criteria applied in selecting articles were prospective observational study or experimental design study in English, evaluating antibodies in breast milk, and conducted between 2019–2021. Article quality and risk of bias were assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). The data found were synthesized in a narrative manner. Results: This systematic review included 20 articles. A total of 306 postpartum women who were infected with COVID-19, 20 postpartum women who had viral symptoms and 495 postpartum women who had been vaccinated were studied. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found in the breast milk of infected and vaccinated postpartum women. SARS CoV-2 infection is associated with the presence of IgA dominant, whereas vaccination is related to the presence of IgG dominant. Antibodies persisted from day 10 of onset to 10 months in infected postpartum women and started from three days to six weeks in vaccinated postpartum women. Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the variety of articles. Conclusions: Antibodies found in breast milk in infected and vaccinated postpartum women have different dominant types. Further research needs to be done regarding the mechanism of antibody transfer in breast milk, longer research duration and studies that directly examine the comparison of antibodies in breast milk in vaccinated and infected postpartum women. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022340859, 23 June 2022).

                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

                Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review the existing research on the antecedents of entrepreneurial networking behavior namely motivational factors and personality factors and its impact on business performance. Design/methodology/approach This study employs a systematic review methodology, adhering to PRISMA guidelines.. Using the SCOPUS database, the search involved Boolean operators to narrow down relevant articles published in English between 2000 and 2024. Following a meticulous screening process, 32 articles were selected for review after removing duplicates and excluding non-English articles. Methodological quality assessment ensuring focused research questions, precise subject selection methods, representative samples, and reliable measurement instruments was carried out. Findings The results demonstrate that entrepreneurs who are self-reliant and extroverted have fewer partners, however, these traits positively impact networking activities. The Big Five personality traits predict business creation and success of ventures. Desire for financial gain, risk-taking propensity, self-confidence, and the need for achievement influences networking behavior. Implications The insights given in this paper can be used for establishing valuable connections, investing in resources, and preparing effective strategies for businesses. Policymakers who aim to promote entrepreneurial behavior among experienced individuals must emphasize the motivations for starting a business and the role of personalities in harnessing and leveraging individual entrepreneurial expertise. Originality The existing literature on antecedents of entrepreneurial networking Behavior and the relationship of these antecedents together with business performance is limited. Further, this review article also offers avenues for future researchers.

                With the increase in plastic waste in the environment, it is undeniable that humans and most organisms are exposed to plastic particles of various sizes, including nanoplastics (NPs). Humans are at risk owing to various routes of entry, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. While the toxicity of NPs is still debatable due to the scarcity of resources and research, most studies have concluded that NPs may exert toxicity, which exacerbates their neurotoxicity potential. Earlier studies concluded that NPs can cause oxidative stress, which results in apoptosis of neuronal cells. Some studies have shown that NPs can affect fundamental cell functions by inducing physical stress through deposition. Furthermore, studies on in vivo models exposed to NPs have demonstrated behavioral changes that are presumably due to alterations in acetylcholinesterase activity and neurotransmitter levels. This review discusses studies conducted on the neurotoxic potential of NPs and their effects, which are dependent on several parameters, including size and type of NPs, exposure concentration, duration, and various models at risk of NP exposure. Furthermore, speculations on how NPs are related to neurotoxicity are also discussed.

                Learning new motor skills involves significant changes in the connectivity and activity of brain motor circuits. In this review, Roth and Ding discuss recent findings on motor-learning-induced neural plasticity within the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, highlighting the role of circuit adaptations and underlying synaptic plasticity mechanisms.

                Meng et al. show that 1% oxygen results in cell cycle re-entry in macrophages. Mechanistically, this is triggered by an HIF2α-directed transcriptional program and accompanied by reversible activation of the canonical MEK/ERK proliferation pathway. CDK1-associated SAMHD1 phosphorylation at T592 in hypoxic macrophages renders them more susceptible to lentiviral transduction.

                Despite the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, many patients remain unresponsive, and predictive biomarkers are needed. Xu et al. identify P2RY6 as a key driver of immune evasion in cancers, promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy, thus nominating P2RY6 as a precision immunotherapy target.

                Dai et al. show that deubiquitylase OTUD3 suppresses liver cancer’s progression and sorafenib resistance by removing the K27-linked ubiquitin chains on eIF2α, which function as a bridge to recruit EIF2AK3 and activate ISR. Combined inhibition of ISR is a promising therapeutic strategy to counter sorafenib resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95318">RBM7 deficiency promotes breast cancer metastasis by coordinating MFGE8 splicing switch and NF-kB pathway</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant alternative splicing is well-known to be closely associated with tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis driven by deregulated splicing events remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveiled that RBM7 is decreased in lymph node and distant organ metastases of breast cancer as compared to primary lesions and low expression of RBM7 is correlated with the reduced disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. Breast cancer cells with RBM7 depletion exhibited an increased potential for lung metastasis compared to scramble control cells. The absence of RBM7 stimulated breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, RBM7 controlled the splicing switch of MFGE8, favoring the production of the predominant isoform of MFGE8, MFGE8-L. This resulted in the attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation and alterations in cell adhesion molecules. MFGE8-L exerted an inhibitory effect on the migratory and invasive capability of breast cancer cells, while the truncated isoform MFGE8-S, which lack the second F5/8 type C domain had the opposite effect. In addition, RBM7 negatively regulates the NF-κB cascade and an NF-κB inhibitor could obstruct the increase in HUVEC tube formation caused by RBM7 silencing. Clinically, we noticed a positive correlation between RBM7 expression and MFGE8 exon7 inclusion in breast cancer tissues, providing new mechanistic insights for molecular-targeted therapy in combating breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93194">Evolutionary adaptation of an HP1-protein chromodomain integrates chromatin and DNA sequence signals</a></h4>

              
                Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the <i>Drosophila</i> PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner et al., 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and in vivo genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino’s chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> mutation phenocopy <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of <i>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></i> flies. Thus, Rhino’s chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91931">The components of an electrical synapse as revealed by expansion microscopy of a single synaptic contact</a></h4>

              
                Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell-cell communication, known as 'chemical' and 'electrical' synapses, respectively. Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components. Electrical synapses are, on the other hand, generally defined by the presence of a 'gap junction' (a cluster of intercellular channels) between two neuronal processes. However, while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism, it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures. We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse. Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures. Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components. Remarkably, most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95397">Uncovering the BIN1-SH3 interactome underpinning centronuclear myopathy</a></h4>

              
                Truncation of the protein-protein interaction SH3 domain of the membrane remodeling Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1, Amphiphysin 2) protein leads to centronuclear myopathy. Here, we assessed the impact of a set of naturally observed, previously uncharacterized BIN1 SH3 domain variants using conventional <i>in vitro</i> and cell-based assays monitoring the BIN1 interaction with dynamin 2 (DNM2) and identified potentially harmful ones that can be also tentatively connected to neuromuscular disorders. However, SH3 domains are typically promiscuous and it is expected that other, so far unknown partners of BIN1 exist besides DNM2, that also participate in the development of centronuclear myopathy. In order to shed light on these other relevant interaction partners and to get a holistic picture of the pathomechanism behind BIN1 SH3 domain variants, we used affinity interactomics. We identified hundreds of new BIN1 interaction partners proteome-wide, among which many appear to participate in cell division, suggesting a critical role of BIN1 in the regulation of mitosis. Finally, we show that the identified BIN1 mutations indeed cause proteome-wide affinity perturbation, signifying the importance of employing unbiased affinity interactomic approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89032">Vacuolar H+-ATPase determines daughter cell fates through asymmetric segregation of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex</a></h4>

              
                Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>–adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.

">Sarm1-Dependent Metabolic Reprogramming of Schwann Cells Following Nerve Injury</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells (SCs) transition into a repair phenotype after peripheral nerve injury, which is crucial for supporting axon regeneration. However, the early SC injury response preceding the repair state remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sarm1, a key regulator of axon degeneration, is expressed in SCs and has a critical role in the early SC injury response. Leveraging the fact that Sarm1 deletion impairs the SC transition to the repair state, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional responses of wild-type and Sarm1 knockout SCs 24 hours after nerve injury. Remarkably, Sarm1-deficient SCs, unlike wild-type SCs, showed increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle. These findings were functionally validated, revealing that Sarm1 knockout SCs displayed increased mitochondrial respiration in response to injury. Intriguingly, Sarm1 knockout SCs also exhibited enhanced axon protection compared to wild-type SCs in an in vitro model of axon degeneration. We propose that Sarm1 gates the transition of SCs from a protective, oxidative phosphorylation-dependent state (which we term Protection Associated Schwann Cells or PASCs) to a glycolytic, pro-regenerative repair phenotype after injury. Our findings challenge the prevailing view of Sarm1 as an exclusively axon-autonomous regulator of degeneration and reveal a paradigm shift in understanding the role of Sarm1 in the SC injury response, with broad implications for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Translatome analysis reveals cellular network in DLK-dependent hippocampal glutamatergic neuron degeneration</a></h4>

              
                The conserved MAP3K12/Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) plays versatile roles in neuronal development, axon injury and stress responses, and neurodegeneration, depending on cell-type and cellular contexts. Emerging evidence implicates abnormal DLK signaling in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of the DLK-dependent gene network in the central nervous system remains limited. Here, we investigated the roles of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons using conditional knockout and induced overexpression mice. We found that dorsal CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons are vulnerable to elevated expression of DLK, while CA3 neurons appear largely unaffected. We identified the DLK-dependent translatome that includes conserved molecular signatures and displays cell-type specificity. Increasing DLK signaling is associated with disruptions to microtubules, potentially involving STMN4. Additionally, primary cultured hippocampal neurons expressing different levels of DLK show altered neurite outgrowth, axon specification, and synapse formation. The identification of translational targets of DLK in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons has relevance to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.

	<p>Emotion dysregulation has long been considered a key symptom in multiple psychiatric disorders. Difficulties in emotion regulation have been associated with neural dysregulation in fronto-limbic circuits. Real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) has become increasingly popular as a potential treatment for emotional dysregulation in psychiatric disorders, as it is able to directly target the impaired neural circuits. However, the clinical impact of these rt-fMRI-NFB protocols in psychiatric populations is still largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of primary studies from 2010 to 2023 that used rt-fMRI-NFB to target emotion regulation. We assessed 41 out of 4001 original studies for methodological quality and risk of bias and synthesised concerning the frequency of significant rt-fMRI-NFB-related effects on the neural and behaviour level. Successful modulation of brain activity was reported in between 25 and 50 percent of study samples, while neural effects in clinical samples were more diverse than in healthy samples. Interestingly, the frequency of rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was over 75 percent in clinical samples, while healthy samples showed behavioural improvements between 0 and 25 percent. Concerning clinical subsamples, rt-fMRI-NFB-related behavioural improvement was observed in up to 100 percent of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) samples. Substance use samples showed behavioural benefits ranging between 50 and 75 percent. Neural effects appeared to be less frequent than behavioural improvements: most neural outcomes ranged between 25 and 50 percent for MDD and substance use and between 0 and 25 percent for PTSD. Using multiple individualised regions of interest (ROIs) for rt-fMRI-NFB training resulted in more frequent behavioural benefits than rt-fMRI-NFB solely based on the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. While a significant improvement in behavioural outcomes was reported in most clinical studies, the study protocols were heterogeneous, which limits the current evaluation of rt-fMRI-NFB as a putative treatment for emotional dysregulation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic and progressive neuropsychiatric illness. Apart from positive and negative symptoms, 98% of the population diagnosed with schizophrenia have impaired cognitive functioning, which significantly influences the quality of life. The correlation between lipids and cognitive functioning has been well established. Our study aimed to investigate correlations between cognitive functions, the severity of schizophrenia symptoms, and lipid profiles. (2) Methods: Fifty-two women diagnosed with schizophrenia participated in this study. Cognitive functioning was measured using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) was used. The serum lipid profile, including low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and triglycerides was measured. (3) Results: Better cognitive functions were associated with normal HDL levels, while low HDL levels correlated with worse WSCT scores. Only the PANSS negative subscale showed a correlation with HDL levels. Correlations with chronicity of schizophrenia and the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s age with poorer cognitive functions, but not with symptom severity, were detected. Early/late age at onset did not influence WSCT scores (4). Conclusions: Our results suggest high HDL levels might be a protective factor against cognitive impairment. The influences of age and illness duration also play a vital role in cognitive performance.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to investigate the significance of baseline measurements for amateur team athletes playing contact and collision team sports with a specific focus on the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to improve concussion management. Symptoms of sports-related concussions (SRCs) can be diverse and long-lasting and include cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and vestibular dysfunction. Therefore, comprehensive baseline data are essential to preventing recurrent concussions and secondary injuries. This study was conducted during the 2023 off-season and evaluated the baseline condition of 65 male university rugby players using the SCAT5, which includes self-reported symptoms, and the modified Balance Error Scoring System (mBESS). The athletes were assessed for the presence or absence of SRC, and the mean values were compared using the Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test. Among the participants, 35.38% (23/65) reported symptoms, with an average of 1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 symptoms per player and an average symptom score of 2.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.93. In the mBESS, no errors were observed in the tandem stance test; however, 72.31% (47/65) made errors in the single-leg stance test on the non-dominant foot, with an average of 1.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 errors. Many athletes self-reported symptoms and balance errors, even during asymptomatic periods before experiencing concussion, indicating unresolved issues. In the injury history survey, the baseline evaluations and injury histories of the participants classified into the SRC and non-SRC groups were compared. In the mBESS single-leg stance test (non-dominant foot), 84.21% (32/38) of the SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 2.13 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.52, whereas 55.55% (15/27) of the non-SRC group participants made errors, with an average score of 1.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.35, showing a significant difference (p = 0.007). Additionally, significant differences were observed in the average number of ankle sprains (p = 0.027) and fractures (p = 0.048) between patients with and without a history of SRC. These findings indicate that athletes may have underlying issues even during normal periods before concussion. Moreover, the results highlighted the impact of previous concussions on motor control and injury risk. This underscores the importance of preseason baseline measurements using the SCAT to identify at-risk athletes and implement preventive measures. These findings align with the recommendations of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport and suggest further refinement of concussion assessment tools.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a significant concern as it is a risk factor for AD progression, and early detection is vital in order to delay dementia onset and enable potential therapeutic interventions. Olfactory impairment is recognized as a predictive biomarker in neurodegenerative processes. The aims of this study were to explore the degree of entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) and the severity of MCI symptoms; to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results for the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, peri entorhinal cortex, and the cerebellar tentorium; and to perform a comprehensive neuropsychological and psychophysical assessment. The main results highlighted that in our sample&amp;amp;mdash;multidomain amnesic MCI patients with hyposmic symptomatology&amp;amp;mdash;we found that ERICA scores were associated with the severity of anxiety symptomatology. One possible hypothesis to explain this observation is that anxiety may contribute to neurodegenerative processes by inducing chronic stress and inflammation. Future research should consider the longitudinal development of neuropsychological scores, anxiety disorders, and brain atrophy to determine their potential predictive value for MCI progression. These findings suggest the importance of psychological factors in MCI progression and the utility of neuropsychological assessment alongside neuroimaging techniques for early detection and follow-up in MCI patients.</p>

	<p>Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF)-induced illusion of hand movements produces beneficial effects in patients with chronic pain. However, neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly known. In this preliminary study, we test the novel hypothesis that such an MVF-induced movement illusion may exert its effects by changing the activity in midline cortical areas associated with pain processing. Electrical stimuli with individually fixed intensity were applied to the left hand of healthy adults to produce painful and non-painful sensations during unilateral right-hand movements with such an MVF illusion and right and bilateral hand movements without MVF. During these events, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of EEG alpha rhythms (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 Hz) indexed the neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms inducing cortical activation. Compared to the painful sensations, the non-painful sensations were specifically characterized by (1) lower alpha ERD estimated in the cortical midline, angular gyrus, and lateral parietal regions during the experimental condition with MVF and (2) higher alpha ERD estimated in the lateral prefrontal and parietal regions during the control conditions without MVF. These preliminary results suggest that the MVF-induced movement illusion may affect nociception and neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms, reducing the activation in cortical limbic and default mode regions.</p>

	<p>Over the past three decades, substantial advancements have occurred in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). These developments encompass various non-invasive techniques aimed at modulating brain function. Among the most widely utilized methods today are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), which include direct- or alternating-current transcranial stimulation (tDCS/tACS). In addition to these established techniques, newer modalities have emerged, broadening the scope of non-invasive neuromodulation approaches available for research and clinical applications in movement disorders, particularly for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and, to a lesser extent, atypical Parkinsonism (AP). All NIBS techniques offer the opportunity to explore a wide range of neurophysiological mechanisms and exert influence over distinct brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism. This paper&amp;amp;rsquo;s first aim is to provide a brief overview of the historical background and underlying physiological principles of primary NIBS techniques, focusing on their translational relevance. It aims to shed light on the potential identification of biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, by summarising available experimental data on individuals with Parkinsonism. To date, despite promising findings indicating the potential utility of NIBS techniques in Parkinsonism, their integration into clinical routine for diagnostic or therapeutic protocols remains a subject of ongoing investigation and scientific debate. In this context, this paper addresses current unsolved issues and methodological challenges concerning the use of NIBS, focusing on the importance of future research endeavours for maximizing the efficacy and relevance of NIBS strategies for individuals with Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increases primary motor cortex (M1) excitability and improves motor performance when applied unilaterally to the dominant hemisphere. However, the influence of tDCS on contralateral M1 excitability both during and after application has not been quantified. The purpose was to determine the influence of tDCS applied to the dominant M1 on the excitability of the contralateral non-dominant M1. This study employed a double-blind, randomized, SHAM-controlled, within-subject crossover experimental design. Eighteen young adults performed two experimental sessions (tDCS, SHAM) in counterbalanced order separated by a one-week washout. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to quantify the excitability of the contralateral M1 to which anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min with a current strength of 1 mA. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed in 5 TMS test blocks (Pre, D5, D10, D15, and Post). The Pre and Post TMS test blocks were performed immediately before and after tDCS application, whereas the TMS test blocks performed during tDCS were completed at the 5, 10, and 15 min stimulation timepoints. MEPs were analyzed with a 2 condition (tDCS, SHAM) &amp;amp;times; 5 test (Pre, D5, D10, D15, Post) within-subject ANOVA. The main effect for condition (p = 0.213), the main effect for test (p = 0.502), and the condition &amp;amp;times; test interaction (p = 0.860) were all not statistically significant. These results indicate that tDCS does not modulate contralateral M1 excitability during or immediately after application, at least under the current set of common tDCS parameters of stimulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0263-24.2024?rss=1">Enhanced Synaptic Inhibition in the Dorsolateral Geniculate Nucleus in a Mouse Model of Glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) triggers glaucoma by damaging the output neurons of the retina called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This leads to the loss of RGC signaling to visual centers of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is critical for processing and relaying information to the cortex for conscious vision. In response to altered levels of activity or synaptic input, neurons can homeostatically modulate postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor numbers, allowing them to scale their synaptic responses to stabilize spike output. While prior work has indicated unaltered glutamate receptor properties in the glaucomatous dLGN, it is unknown whether glaucoma impacts dLGN inhibition. Here, using DBA/2J mice, which develop elevated IOP beginning at 6&ndash;7&nbsp;months of age, we tested whether the strength of inhibitory synapses on dLGN thalamocortical relay neurons is altered in response to the disease state. We found an enhancement of feedforward disynaptic inhibition arising from local interneurons along with increased amplitude of quantal inhibitory synaptic currents. A combination of immunofluorescence staining for the -aminobutyric acid (GABA)<SUB>A</SUB>-&alpha;1 receptor subunit, peak-scaled nonstationary fluctuation analysis, and measures of homeostatic synaptic scaling pointed to an ~1.4-fold increase in GABA receptors at postsynaptic inhibitory synapses, although several pieces of evidence indicate a nonuniform scaling across inhibitory synapses within individual relay neurons. Together, these results indicate an increase in inhibitory synaptic strength in the glaucomatous dLGN, potentially pointing toward homeostatic compensation for disruptions in network and neuronal function triggered by increased IOP.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0515-23.2024?rss=1">Exploring Electrocortical Signatures of Gait Adaptation: Differential Neural Dynamics in Slow and Fast Gait Adapters</a></h4>

              
                <p>Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait adaptation.</p>

                Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-coupled protein receptor that induces crucial biological processes when bound by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Here, we have characterized nine S1PR1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                One of the factors causing rice production disturbance in Indonesia is that farmers lack knowledge of early symptoms of rice plant diseases. These diseases are increasingly rampant because of the lack of experts. This study aimed to overcome this problem by providing an Expert System that helps farmers to make an early diagnosis of rice plant diseases. Data of rice plant pests and diseases in 2016 were taken from Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia using an in-depth survey, and rice experts from the Department of Food Crops and Horticulture of East Kalimantan Province were recruited for the project. The Expert System for Rice Plant Disease Diagnosis, ESforRPD2, was developed based on the pest and disease experiences of the rice experts and uses a Waterfall Paradigm and Unified Modeling Language. This Expert System can detect 48 symptoms and 8 types of diseases of rice plants from 16 data tests with a sensitivity of 87.5%. The system can also provide recommendations for the treatment of identified diseases. ESforRPD2 is available in Indonesian at http://esforrpd2.blog.unmul.ac.id

                Abstract* Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through a fine-tuning process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of fine-tuning their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Yeasts are widely known for their application in food production, but also because of their clinical significance. As human pathogens, several species of yeasts, mainly of the genus Candida, are responsible for a great number of life-threatening infections. The occurrence of yeasts in cheeses, including pathogenic species, has been largely studied, yet the antifungal susceptibility of these microorganisms is rarely reported. Here, we identified the species and determined the antifungal susceptibility profile of 45 Candida isolates recovered from artisanal cheeses from 20 cities in Boyacá, Colombia. Among the species, Candida lambica (28.9%) prevailed, followed by Candida krusei (24.4%), Candida kefyr (22.2%), Candida lusitaniae (11.1%), Candida inconspicua (6.7%) Candida parapsilosis (4.4%) and Candida guillermondii (2.2%). Notably, all seven species have been globally reported, to a greater or lesser extent, to cause fungemia and other invasive infections with high mortality rates. Remarkably, most isolates of C. lambica C. krusei, C. inconspicua and C. parapsilosis were resistant to fluconazole, one of the most common drugs to treat candidiasis. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring the ecological niches of pathogenic yeasts, together with their antifungal susceptibility, considering that the emergence of resistance in non-commensal opportunistic pathogens poses a serious threat to public health.

                <p>by Ziyan Guo, Jialu Yu, Wenxin Wang, Patricia Lockwood, Zhen Wu</p>

Altruistic punishment is key to establishing cooperation and maintaining social order, yet its developmental trends across cultures remain unclear. Using computational reinforcement learning models, we provided the first evidence of how social feedback dynamically influences group-biased altruistic punishment across cultures and the lifespan. Study 1 (<i>n</i> = 371) found that Chinese participants exhibited higher learning rates than Americans when socially incentivized to punish unfair allocations. Additionally, Chinese adults showed slower learning and less exploration when punishing ingroups than outgroups, a pattern absent in American counterparts, potentially reflecting a tendency towards ingroup favoritism that may contribute to reinforcing collectivist values. Study 2 (<i>n</i> = 430, aged 12–52) further showed that such ingroup favoritism develops with age. Chinese participants’ learning rates for ingroup punishment decreased from adolescence into adulthood, while outgroup rates stayed constant, implying a process of cultural learning. Our findings highlight cultural and age-related variations in altruistic punishment learning, with implications for social reinforcement learning and culturally sensitive educational practices promoting fairness and altruism.

                <p>by Vinoth Manivannan, Mandar M. Inamdar, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Cells switch genes ON or OFF by altering the state of chromatin via histone modifications at specific regulatory locations along the chromatin polymer. These gene regulation processes are carried out by a network of reactions in which the histone marks spread to neighboring regions with the help of enzymes. In the literature, this spreading has been studied as a purely kinetic, non-diffusive process considering the interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this work, we go beyond this framework and study the spreading of modifications using a reaction-diffusion (RD) model accounting for the diffusion of the constituents. We quantitatively segregate the modification profiles generated from kinetic and RD models. The diffusion and degradation of enzymes set a natural length scale for limiting the domain size of modification spreading, and the resulting enzyme limitation is inherent in our model. We also demonstrate the emergence of confined modification domains without the explicit requirement of a nucleation site. We explore polymer compaction effects on spreading and show that single-cell domains may differ from averaged profiles. We find that the modification profiles from our model are comparable with existing H3K9me3 data of <i>S. pombe</i>.

                <p>by Lu Hong, Tanja Kortemme</p>

With recent methodological advances in the field of computational protein design, in particular those based on deep learning, there is an increasing need for frameworks that allow for coherent, direct integration of different models and objective functions into the generative design process. Here we demonstrate how evolutionary multiobjective optimization techniques can be adapted to provide such an approach. With the established Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) as the optimization framework, we use AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN confidence metrics to define the objective space, and a mutation operator composed of ESM-1v and ProteinMPNN to rank and then redesign the least favorable positions. Using the two-state design problem of the foldswitching protein RfaH as an in-depth case study, and PapD and calmodulin as examples of higher-dimensional design problems, we show that the evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach leads to significant reduction in the bias and variance in RfaH native sequence recovery, compared to a direct application of ProteinMPNN. We suggest that this improvement is due to three factors: (i) the use of an informative mutation operator that accelerates the sequence space exploration, (ii) the parallel, iterative design process inherent to the genetic algorithm that improves upon the ProteinMPNN autoregressive sequence decoding scheme, and (iii) the explicit approximation of the Pareto front that leads to optimal design candidates representing diverse tradeoff conditions. We anticipate this approach to be readily adaptable to different models and broadly relevant for protein design tasks with complex specifications.

The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) refers to a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. It is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process.

                <p>by Maud Delattre, Yusuke Toda, Jessica Tressou, Hiroyoshi Iwata</p>

The evaluation of plant and animal growth, separately for genetic and environmental effects, is necessary for genetic understanding and genetic improvement of environmental responses of plants and animals. We propose to extend an existing approach that combines nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLMEM) and the stochastic approximation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (SAEM) to analyze genetic and environmental effects on plant growth. These tools are widely used in many fields but very rarely in plant biology. During model formulation, a nonlinear function describes the shape of growth, and random effects describe genetic and environmental effects and their variability. Genetic relationships among the varieties were also integrated into the model using a genetic relationship matrix. The SAEM algorithm was chosen as an efficient alternative to MCMC methods, which are more commonly used in the domain. It was implemented to infer the expected growth patterns in the analyzed population and the expected curves for each variety through a maximum-likelihood and a maximum-a-posteriori approaches, respectively. The obtained estimates can be used to predict the growth curves for each variety. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach using simulated data and soybean plant growth data obtained from a soybean cultivation experiment conducted at the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University. In this experiment, plant height was measured daily using drones, and the growth was monitored for approximately 200 soybean cultivars for which whole-genome sequence data were available. The NLMEM approach improved our understanding of the determinants of soybean growth and can be successfully used for the genomic prediction of growth pattern characteristics.

The conserved SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcription factor regulates the expression of proteasome subunit genes and is essential for maintenance of adequate proteasome function in animal development, aging, and stress responses. Unusual among transcription factors, SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a glycoprotein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N-glycosylated SKN-1A/Nrf1 exits the ER and is deglycosylated in the cytosol by the PNG-1/NGLY1 peptide:N-glycanase. Deglycosylation edits the protein sequence of SKN-1A/Nrf1 by converting N-glycosylated asparagine residues to aspartate, which is necessary for SKN-1A/Nrf1 transcriptional activation of proteasome subunit genes. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the peptide:N-glycanase (NGLY1) gene cause NGLY1 deficiency, a congenital disorder of deglycosylation. There are no effective treatments for NGLY1 deficiency. Since SKN-1A/Nrf1 is a major client of NGLY1, the resulting proteasome deficit contributes to NGLY1 disease. We sought to identify targets for mitigation of proteasome dysfunction in NGLY1 deficiency that might indicate new avenues for treatment. We isolated mutations that suppress the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors caused by inactivation of the NGLY1 ortholog PNG-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We identified multiple suppressor mutations affecting 3 conserved genes: <i>rsks-1</i>, <i>tald-1</i>, and <i>ent-4</i>. We show that the suppressors act through a SKN-1/Nrf-independent mechanism and confer proteostasis benefits consistent with amelioration of proteasome dysfunction. <i>ent-4</i> encodes an intestinal nucleoside/nucleotide transporter, and we show that restriction of nucleotide availability is beneficial, whereas a nucleotide-rich diet exacerbates proteasome dysfunction in PNG-1/NGLY1-deficient <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Our findings suggest that dietary or pharmacological interventions altering nucleotide availability have the potential to mitigate proteasome insufficiency in NGLY1 deficiency and other diseases associated with proteasome dysfunction.

                <p>by Jae-Hong Kim, Nakamura Michiko, In-Sun Choi, Yujung Kim, Ji-Young Jeong, Maan-Gee Lee, Il-Sung Jang, Kyoungho Suk</p>

Reactive astrocytes are associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in diverse neuropathologies; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the crucial roles of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in cognitive decline. Our results showed that repeated optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 astrocytes induced cognitive impairment in mice and decreased synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), which was accompanied by the appearance of inflammatory astrocytes. Mechanistic studies conducted using knockout animal models and hippocampal neuronal cultures showed that lipocalin-2 (LCN2), derived from reactive astrocytes, mediated neuroinflammation and induced cognitive impairment by decreasing the LTP through the reduction of neuronal NMDA receptors. Sustained chemogenetic stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes provided similar results. Conversely, these phenomena were attenuated by a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes. Fiber photometry using GCaMP revealed a high level of hippocampal astrocyte activation in the neuroinflammation model. Our findings suggest that reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are sufficient and required to induce cognitive decline through LCN2 release and synaptic modulation. This abnormal glial–neuron interaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of cognitive disturbances in neuroinflammation-associated brain conditions.

Tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) are model systems for global biodiversity science, but continuing data gaps, limited data standardisation, and ongoing flux in taxonomic nomenclature constrain integrative research on this group and potentially cause biased inference. We combined and harmonised taxonomic, spatial, phylogenetic, and attribute data with phylogeny-based multiple imputation to provide a comprehensive data resource (TetrapodTraits 1.0.0) that includes values, predictions, and sources for body size, activity time, micro- and macrohabitat, ecosystem, threat status, biogeography, insularity, environmental preferences, and human influence, for all 33,281 tetrapod species covered in recent fully sampled phylogenies. We assess gaps and biases across taxa and space, finding that shared data missing in attribute values increased with taxon-level completeness and richness across clades. Prediction of missing attribute values using multiple imputation revealed substantial changes in estimated macroecological patterns. These results highlight biases incurred by nonrandom missingness and strategies to best address them. While there is an obvious need for further data collection and updates, our phylogeny-informed database of tetrapod traits can support a more comprehensive representation of tetrapod species and their attributes in ecology, evolution, and conservation research.

                <p>by George A. Schaible, Zackary J. Jay, John Cliff, Frederik Schulz, Colin Gauvin, Danielle Goudeau, Rex R. Malmstrom, S. Emil Ruff, Virginia Edgcomb, Roland Hatzenpichler</p>

Consortia of multicellular magnetotactic bacteria (MMB) are currently the only known example of bacteria without a unicellular stage in their life cycle. Because of their recalcitrance to cultivation, most previous studies of MMB have been limited to microscopic observations. To study the biology of these unique organisms in more detail, we use multiple culture-independent approaches to analyze the genomics and physiology of MMB consortia at single-cell resolution. We separately sequenced the metagenomes of 22 individual MMB consortia, representing 8 new species, and quantified the genetic diversity within each MMB consortium. This revealed that, counter to conventional views, cells within MMB consortia are not clonal. Single consortia metagenomes were then used to reconstruct the species-specific metabolic potential and infer the physiological capabilities of MMB. To validate genomic predictions, we performed stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments and interrogated MMB consortia using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). By coupling FISH with bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), we explored their in situ activity as well as variation of protein synthesis within cells. We demonstrate that MMB consortia are mixotrophic sulfate reducers and that they exhibit metabolic differentiation between individual cells, suggesting that MMB consortia are more complex than previously thought. These findings expand our understanding of MMB diversity, ecology, genomics, and physiology, as well as offer insights into the mechanisms underpinning the multicellular nature of their unique lifestyle.

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1492/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Disseminated hydatid cyst: Unusual presentation and therapeutic challenges [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, is a parasitic disease prevalent in endemic regions. CE frequently leads to the formation of hydatid cysts in various organs, with the liver being the most commonly affected site. Involvement of the spleen has been rarely reported in the literature. Managing disseminated hydatid cyst disease presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Case presentation: A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism presented with sudden onset shortness of breath, dry cough, and chest pain for 3 days. She had a recent travel history to Egypt. Physical examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia and increased inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray and pan-computed tomography (Pan-CT) scans identified multiple cystic lesions in the lung, liver and spleen. Serological tests confirmed the presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated hydatid cyst disease. The patient was managed medically and surgically by a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: Disseminated hydatid cyst disease, though rare, presents complex diagnostic and management challenges. Timely recognition, supported by clinical, radiological, and serological assessments, is essential. Surgical intervention should be considered in a patient when multiple extrahepatic cysts are present, and rupture is evident, as this approach can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mitigate life-threatening complications.

                Purpose: To report the ocular surface and meibomian gland changes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) women taking hormone supplementation. Methods: Case series. Results: Three women (27 ± 11 years) already diagnosed with PCOS presented with dry eye symptoms (mean OSDI, 37.5) for a mean duration of 13 months and were taking hormonal supplements for a mean duration of 60 ± 11 months. The hormonal supplements included oral estrogen (n=3), oral progesterone (n=3), antiandrogen cyproterone (n=1) and isotretinoin (n=1). Ocular surface evaluation revealed mean NIBUT of 9.9 ± 1.6 seconds and mean TMH of 0.27 ± 0.05 mm, assessed non-invasively using Oculus keratograph 5M (K5M). Meibography (K5M) showed near total loss of all meibomian glands (n=8/12 eyelids) with residual ghost glands in all four eyelids of two patients, and gland shortening alone in one patient. The gland morphology did not change following intense thermal pulsation treatment or cessation of hormonal therapy. Conclusions: Near-total irreversible meibomian gland loss was seen in two young PCOS women taking hormonal supplements. Collaboration between ophthalmologists and gynecologists is advisable for early detection and better understanding of dry eye disease (DED) progression in these patients.

     alt="Sexual Dimorphism of Spinal Neural Circuits Controlling the Mouse External Urethral Sphincter With and Without Spinal Cord Injury"/>
<p>Spinal neuronal pool innervating external urethral sphincter (EUS) in female mice has less motoneurons and interneurons compared to males. Spinal cord injury caused the reduction of EUS-related neuronal pool in males but not in females. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts coordination between the bladder and the external urinary sphincter (EUS), leading to transient or permanent voiding impairment, which is more severe in males. Male versus female differences in spinal circuits related to the EUS as well as post-SCI rewiring are essential for understanding of sex-/gender-specific impairments and possible recovery mechanisms. To quantitatively assess differences between EUS circuits in males versus females and in spinal intact (SI) versus SCI animals, we retrogradely traced and counted EUS-related neurons. In transgenic ChAT-GFP mice, motoneurons (MNs), interneurons (INs), and propriospinal neurons (PPNs) were retrogradely trans-synaptically traced with PRV614-red fluorescent protein (RFP) injected into EUS. EUS-MNs in dorsolateral nucleus (DLN) were separated from other GFP<sup>+</sup> MNs by tracing them with FluoroGold (FG). We found two morphologically distinct cell types in DLN: FG<sup>+</sup> spindle-shaped bipolar (SB-MNs) and FG<sup>−</sup> rounded multipolar (RM-MNs) cholinergic cells. Number of MNs of both types in males was twice as large as in females. SCI caused a partial loss of MNs in all spinal nuclei. After SCI, males showed a fourfold rise in the number of RFP-labeled cells in retro-DLN (RDLN) innervating hind limbs. This suggests (a) an existence of direct synaptic interactions between spinal nuclei and (b) a post-SCI increase of non-specific inputs to EUS-MNs from other motor nuclei. Number of INs and PPNs deferred between males and females: In SI males, the numbers of INs and PPNs were ∼10 times larger than in SI females. SCI caused a twofold decrease of INs and PPNs in males but not in females.</p>

     alt="Early Development of the Thalamo-Pallial Stage of the Tectofugal Visual Pathway in the Chicken (Gallus gallus)"/>
<p>We studied in chicken embryos the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial stages of the tectofugal visual system by means of immunohistochemical assays and ex vivo injections of neural tracers. We found that the layered organization of the visual DVR as well as the system of columnar reciprocal connections between vDVR layers (blue axons) were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection (light blue axons) was also present at this stage. Immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization (green, light blue, and blue axons) arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit (black and yellow axons; green soma).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The tectofugal pathway is a highly conserved visual pathway in all amniotes. In birds and mammals, retinorecipient neurons located in the midbrain roof (optic tectum/superior colliculus) are the source of ascending projections to thalamic relays (nucleus rotundus/caudal pulvinar), which in turn project to specific pallial regions (visual dorsal ventricular ridge [vDVR]/temporal cortex) organized according to a columnar recurrent arrangement of interlaminar circuits. Whether or to which extent these striking hodological correspondences arise from comparable developmental processes is at present an open question, mainly due to the scarcity of data about the ontogeny of the avian tectofugal system. Most of the previous developmental studies of this system in birds have focused on the establishment of the retino-tecto-thalamic connectivity, overlooking the development of the thalamo-pallial-intrapallial circuit. In this work, we studied the latter in chicken embryos by means of immunohistochemical assays and precise ex vivo crystalline injections of biocytin and DiI. We found that the layered organization of the vDVR as well as the system of homotopic reciprocal connections between vDVR layers were present as early as E8. A highly organized thalamo-vDVR projection was also present at this stage. Our immunohistochemical assays suggest that both systems of projections emerge simultaneously even earlier. Combined with previous findings, these results reveal that, in striking contrast with mammals, the peripheral and central stages of the avian tectofugal pathway develop along different timelines, with a tecto-thalamo-intrapallial organization arising before and possibly independently of the retino-isthmo-tectal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92534">Bacteria are a major determinant of Orsay virus transmission and infection in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The microbiota is a key determinant of the physiology and immunity of animal hosts. The factors governing the transmissibility of viruses between susceptible hosts are incompletely understood. Bacteria serve as food for <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and represent an integral part of the natural environment of <i>C. elegans</i>. We determined the effects of bacteria isolated with <i>C. elegans</i> from its natural environment on the transmission of Orsay virus in <i>C. elegans</i> using quantitative virus transmission and host susceptibility assays. We observed that <i>Ochrobactrum</i> species promoted Orsay virus transmission, whereas <i>Pseudomonas lurida</i> MYb11 attenuated virus transmission relative to the standard laboratory bacterial food <i>Escherichia coli</i> OP50. We found that pathogenic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains PA01 and PA14 further attenuated virus transmission. We determined that the amount of Orsay virus required to infect 50% of a <i>C. elegans</i> population on <i>P. lurida</i> MYb11 compared with <i>Ochrobactrum vermis</i> MYb71 was dramatically increased, over three orders of magnitude. Host susceptibility was attenuated even further in the presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PA14. Genetic analysis of the determinants of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> required for attenuation of <i>C. elegans</i> susceptibility to Orsay virus infection revealed a role for regulators of quorum sensing. Our data suggest that distinct constituents of the <i>C. elegans</i> microbiota and potential pathogens can have widely divergent effects on Orsay virus transmission, such that associated bacteria can effectively determine host susceptibility versus resistance to viral infection. Our study provides quantitative evidence for a critical role for tripartite host-virus-bacteria interactions in determining the transmissibility of viruses among susceptible hosts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92426">Human DDX6 regulates translation and decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings indicate that the translation elongation rate influences mRNA stability. One of the factors that has been implicated in this link between mRNA decay and translation speed is the yeast DEAD-box helicase Dhh1p. Here, we demonstrated that the human ortholog of Dhh1p, DDX6, triggers the deadenylation-dependent decay of inefficiently translated mRNAs in human cells. DDX6 interacts with the ribosome through the Phe-Asp-Phe (FDF) motif in its RecA2 domain. Furthermore, RecA2-mediated interactions and ATPase activity are both required for DDX6 to destabilize inefficiently translated mRNAs. Using ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, we identified two classes of endogenous mRNAs that are regulated in a DDX6-dependent manner. The identified targets are either translationally regulated or regulated at the steady-state-level and either exhibit signatures of poor overall translation or of locally reduced ribosome translocation rates. Transferring the identified sequence stretches into a reporter mRNA caused translation- and DDX6-dependent degradation of the reporter mRNA. In summary, these results identify DDX6 as a crucial regulator of mRNA translation and decay triggered by slow ribosome movement and provide insights into the mechanism by which DDX6 destabilizes inefficiently translated mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96281">Chronic activation of a negative engram induces behavioral and cellular abnormalities</a></h4>

              
                Negative memories engage a brain and body-wide stress response in humans that can alter cognition and behavior. Prolonged stress responses induce maladaptive cellular, circuit, and systems-level changes that can lead to pathological brain states and corresponding disorders in which mood and memory are affected. However, it is unclear if repeated activation of cells processing negative memories induces similar phenotypes in mice. In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging method to access neuronal ensembles and assess their molecular characteristics. Sequencing memory engrams in mice revealed that positive (male-to-female exposure) and negative (foot shock) cells upregulated genes linked to anti- and pro-inflammatory responses, respectively. To investigate the impact of persistent activation of negative engrams, we chemogenetically activated them in the ventral hippocampus over 3 months and conducted anxiety and memory-related tests. Negative engram activation increased anxiety behaviors in both 6- and 14-month-old mice, reduced spatial working memory in older mice, impaired fear extinction in younger mice, and heightened fear generalization in both age groups. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in microglial and astrocytic structure and number in the hippocampus. In summary, repeated activation of negative memories induces lasting cellular and behavioral abnormalities in mice, offering insights into the negative effects of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors on human health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89478">The target of rapamycin signaling pathway regulates vegetative development, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus</a></h4>

              
                The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is highly conserved and plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes in eukaryotes. Despite its significance, the underlying mechanism of the TOR pathway in <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> remains elusive. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the TOR signaling pathway in <i>A. flavus</i> by identifying and characterizing nine genes that encode distinct components of this pathway. The FK506-binding protein Fkbp3 and its lysine succinylation are important for aflatoxin production and rapamycin resistance. The TorA kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth, spore production, aflatoxin biosynthesis, and responses to rapamycin and cell membrane stress. As a significant downstream effector molecule of the TorA kinase, the Sch9 kinase regulates aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) synthesis, osmotic and calcium stress response in <i>A. flavus,</i> and this regulation is mediated through its S_TKc, S_TK_X domains, and the ATP-binding site at K340. We also showed that the Sch9 kinase may have a regulatory impact on the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway. TapA and TipA, the other downstream components of the TorA kinase, play a significant role in regulating cell wall stress response in <i>A. flavus</i>. Moreover, the members of the TapA-phosphatase complexes, SitA and Ppg1, are important for various biological processes in <i>A. flavus</i>, including vegetative growth, sclerotia formation, AFB<sub>1</sub> biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. We also demonstrated that SitA and Ppg1 are involved in regulating lipid droplets (LDs) biogenesis and cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathways. In addition, another phosphatase complex, Nem1/Spo7, plays critical roles in hyphal development, conidiation, aflatoxin production, and LDs biogenesis. Collectively, our study has provided important insight into the regulatory network of the TOR signaling pathway and has elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of aflatoxin biosynthesis in <i>A. flavus</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91828">Human HPSE2 gene transfer ameliorates bladder pathophysiology in a mutant mouse model of urofacial syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Rare early-onset lower urinary tract disorders include defects of functional maturation of the bladder. Current treatments do not target the primary pathobiology of these diseases. Some have a monogenic basis, such as urofacial, or Ochoa, syndrome (UFS). Here, the bladder does not empty fully because of incomplete relaxation of its outflow tract, and subsequent urosepsis can cause kidney failure. UFS is associated with biallelic variants of <i>HPSE2</i>, encoding heparanase-2. This protein is detected in pelvic ganglia, autonomic relay stations that innervate the bladder and control voiding. Bladder outflow tracts of <i>Hpse2</i> mutant mice display impaired neurogenic relaxation. We hypothesized that <i>HPSE2</i> gene transfer soon after birth would ameliorate this defect and explored an adeno-associated viral (<i>AAV</i>) vector-based approach. AAV9<i>/HPSE2,</i> carrying human <i>HPSE2</i> driven by <i>CAG</i>, was administered intravenously into neonatal mice. In the third postnatal week, transgene transduction and expression were sought, and ex vivo myography was undertaken to measure bladder function. In mice administered AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i>, the viral genome was detected in pelvic ganglia. Human <i>HPSE2</i> was expressed and heparanase-2 became detectable in pelvic ganglia of treated mutant mice. On autopsy, wild-type mice had empty bladders, whereas bladders were uniformly distended in mutant mice, a defect ameliorated by AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i> treatment. Therapeutically, AAV9<i>/HPSE2</i> significantly ameliorated impaired neurogenic relaxation of <i>Hpse2</i> mutant bladder outflow tracts. Impaired neurogenic contractility of mutant detrusor smooth muscle was also significantly improved. These results constitute first steps towards curing UFS, a clinically devastating genetic disease featuring a bladder autonomic neuropathy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93498">Clustered synapses develop in distinct dendritic domains in visual cortex before eye opening</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic inputs to cortical neurons are highly structured in adult sensory systems, such that neighboring synapses along dendrites are activated by similar stimuli. This organization of synaptic inputs, called synaptic clustering, is required for high-fidelity signal processing, and clustered synapses can already be observed before eye opening. However, how clustered inputs emerge during development is unknown. Here, we employed concurrent in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp and dendritic calcium imaging to map spontaneous synaptic inputs to dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex during the second postnatal week until eye opening. We found that the number of functional synapses and the frequency of transmission events increase several fold during this developmental period. At the beginning of the second postnatal week, synapses assemble specifically in confined dendritic segments, whereas other segments are devoid of synapses. By the end of the second postnatal week, just before eye opening, dendrites are almost entirely covered by domains of co-active synapses. Finally, co-activity with their neighbor synapses correlates with synaptic stabilization and potentiation. Thus, clustered synapses form in distinct functional domains presumably to equip dendrites with computational modules for high-capacity sensory processing when the eyes open.

	<p>The purpose of our study was to obtain evidence that an unsupervised tele-exercise program (TEgroup) via an online platform is a feasible alternative to a hybrid mode of supervised and unsupervised exercise (HEgroup) sessions for improving fitness indexes, respiratory and cognitive functions, and biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients recovering from COVID-19. Forty-nine patients with long post-COVID-19 were randomly divided into two groups (HEgroup: n = 24, age 60.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5 years versus TEgroup: n = 25, age 58.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5 years). For each patient, we collected data from body composition, oxidative stress, pulmonary function, physical fitness, and cognitive function before and after the 12-week exercise rehabilitation program (ERP). Our data showed differences in both groups before and after 12-week ERP on fitness indicators, body composition, and pulmonary function indicators. Our findings demonstrated differences between groups after 12-week ERP on adjustment in the domains of cognitive function (HEgroup increased the &amp;amp;ldquo;visuospatial&amp;amp;rdquo; domain: 3.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.1 versus 3.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.8 score, p = 0.008 and TEgroup increased the &amp;amp;ldquo;memory&amp;amp;rdquo; domain: 3.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.0 versus 3.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.5 score, p = 0.003; after 12-week ERP showed differences between groups in domain &amp;amp;ldquo;attention&amp;amp;rdquo; TEgroup: 4.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 versus HEgroup: 3.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.8 score, p = 0.014) and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (HEgroup increased the percent of predicted values at 0.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 32.3% and TEgroup at 26.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 33.1%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings may be attributed to the different ways of learning exercise programs, resulting in the recruitment of different neural circuits.</p>

	<p>Persons with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) often experience limitations in their quality of life (QoL). Some studies have shown positive effects of speech and language therapy on QoL in persons with PPA. However, there is still a lack of evidence for disorder-specific approaches for this important therapeutic goal. The biographic-narrative approach (narraktiv) has been shown to significantly improve QoL in persons with post-stroke aphasia. In the planned study, the biographic-narrative approach will be adapted for persons with PPA (Cope PPA), and its efficacy will be investigated. First, a focus group interview with five persons with PPA will be conducted to identify the wishes and needs of participants. Based on the results, the narraktiv manual according to Corsten et al. (2015) will be revised. Second, an efficacy study will be conducted according to the new Cope PPA manual with 24 persons with PPA in a waiting group control design. The primary outcome, QoL, will be assessed using questionnaires (Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39) and semistructured interviews. Depressive symptoms, life satisfaction and cognitive/communicative functioning will also be assessed. If Cope PPA proves efficacy, this study may help to improve the treatment of persons with PPA.</p>

	<p>Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease that affects the Central Nervous System by causing demyelination. Social cognition (SC) deficits are common among individuals with MS and can significantly impact their quality of life (QoL) due to difficulties in interpreting social cues and establishing meaningful relationships. Objective: This scoping review aimed to investigate SC in subjects with MS and its impact on QoL. Methods: Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases. After reading the full text of the selected studies and applying predefined inclusion criteria, four studies were included based on pertinence and relevance to the topic. Results: The findings highlight significant associations between SC deficits, social support, fatigue, and QoL outcomes. Cognitive decline was identified as a predictive factor for SC impairment in the MS population, which affects daily activities and relationships, thereby reducing QoL. Moreover, emotional impairments such as depression and anxiety exacerbate these challenges. Enhancing social support networks may improve psychological well-being and disease management in MS. Conclusions: Although evidence is limited, assessing SC is crucial in the care pathways for MS to develop tailored psychosocial interventions that address the cognitive, emotional, and social facets of the disease, thereby improving overall outcomes and QoL.</p>

                <p>Dysregulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) recruitment and oligodendrocyte differentiation contribute to failure of remyelination in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Deletion of muscarinic receptor enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. However, the role of ligand-dependent signaling versus constitutive receptor activation is unknown. We hypothesized that dysregulated acetylcholine (ACh) release upon demyelination contributes to ligand-mediated activation hindering myelin repair. Following chronic cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination (male and female mice), we observed a 2.5-fold increase in ACh concentration. This increase in ACh concentration could be attributed to increased ACh synthesis or decreased acetylcholinesterase-/butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-mediated degradation. Using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) reporter mice, we identified increased ChAT-GFP expression following both lysolecithin and CPZ demyelination. ChAT-GFP expression was upregulated in a subset of injured and uninjured axons following intraspinal lysolecithin-induced demyelination. In CPZ-demyelinated corpus callosum, ChAT-GFP was observed in Gfap<sup>+</sup> astrocytes and axons indicating the potential for neuronal and astrocytic ACh release. <I>BChE</I> expression was significantly decreased in the corpus callosum following CPZ demyelination. This decrease was due to the loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes which were the primary source of BChE. To determine the role of ligand-mediated muscarinic signaling following lysolecithin injection, we administered neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, to artificially raise ACh. We identified a dose-dependent decrease in mature oligodendrocyte density with no effect on OPC recruitment. Together, these results support a functional role of ligand-mediated activation of muscarinic receptors following demyelination and suggest that dysregulation of ACh homeostasis directly contributes to failure of remyelination in MS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/28/e0060242024?rss=1">Trying Harder: How Cognitive Effort Sculpts Neural Representations during Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the exertion of mental effort improves performance on cognitive tasks, the neural mechanisms by which motivational factors impact cognition remain unknown. Here, we used fMRI to test how changes in cognitive effort, induced by changes in task difficulty, impact neural representations of working memory (WM). Participants (both sexes) were precued whether WM difficulty would be hard or easy. We hypothesized that hard trials demanded more effort as a later decision required finer mnemonic precision. Behaviorally, pupil size was larger and response times were slower on hard compared with easy trials suggesting our manipulation of effort succeeded. Neurally, we observed robust persistent activity during delay periods in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially during hard trials. Yet, details of the memoranda could not be decoded from patterns in prefrontal activity. In the patterns of activity in the visual cortex, however, we found strong decoding of memorized targets, where accuracy was higher on hard trials. To potentially link these across-region effects, we hypothesized that effort, carried by persistent activity in the PFC, impacts the quality of WM representations encoded in the visual cortex. Indeed, we found that the amplitude of delay period activity in the frontal cortex predicted decoded accuracy in the visual cortex on a trial-wise basis. These results indicate that effort-related feedback signals sculpt population activity in the visual cortex, improving mnemonic fidelity.</p>

                <p>Obesity is associated with hypogonadism in males, characterized by low testosterone and sperm number. Previous studies determined that these stem from dysregulation of hypothalamic circuitry that regulates reproduction, by unknown mechanisms. Herein, we used mice fed chronic high-fat diet, which mimics human obesity, to determine mechanisms of impairment at the level of the hypothalamus, in particular gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that regulate luteinizing hormone (LH), which then regulates testosterone. Consistent with obese humans, we demonstrated lower LH, and lower pulse frequency of LH secretion, but unchanged pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. LH pulse frequency is regulated by pulsatile GnRH secretion, which is controlled by kisspeptin. Peripheral and central kisspeptin injections, and DREADD-mediated activation of kisspeptin neurons, demonstrated that kisspeptin neurons were suppressed in obese mice. Thus, we investigated regulators of kisspeptin secretion. We determined that the LH response to NMDA was lower in obese mice, corresponding to fewer glutamate receptors in kisspeptin neurons, which may be critical for kisspeptin synchronization. Given that kisspeptin neurons also interact with anorexigenic POMC neurons, which are affected by obesity, we examined their cross talk, and determined that the LH response to either DREADD-mediated activation of POMC neurons or central injection of &alpha;MSH, a product of POMC, is abolished in obese mice. This was accompanied by diminished levels of &alpha;MSH receptor, MC4R, in kisspeptin neurons. Together, our studies determined that obesity leads to the downregulation of receptors that regulate kisspeptin neurons, which is associated with lower LH pulse frequency, leading to lower LH and hypogonadism.</p>

                <p>Interspecies comparisons are key to deriving an understanding of the behavioral and neural correlates of human cognition from animal models. We perform a detailed comparison of the strategies of female macaque monkeys to male and female humans on a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a widely studied and applied task that provides a multiattribute measure of cognitive function and depends on the frontal lobe. WCST performance requires the inference of a rule change given ambiguous feedback. We found that well-trained monkeys infer new rules three times more slowly than minimally instructed humans. Input-dependent hidden Markov model&ndash;generalized linear models were fit to their choices, revealing hidden states akin to feature-based attention in both species. Decision processes resembled a win&ndash;stay, lose&ndash;shift strategy with interspecies similarities as well as key differences. Monkeys and humans both test multiple rule hypotheses over a series of rule-search trials and perform inference-like computations to exclude candidate choice options. We quantitatively show that perseveration, random exploration, and poor sensitivity to negative feedback account for the slower task-switching performance in monkeys.</p>

                <p>SLURP1 and SLURP2 are both small secreted members of the Ly6/u-PAR family of proteins and are highly expressed in keratinocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in SLURP1 lead to a rare autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), Mal de Meleda (MdM), which is characterized by diffuse, yellowish palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Some individuals with MdM experience pain in conjunction with the hyperkeratosis that has been attributed to fissures or microbial superinfection within the affected skin. By comparison, other hereditary PPKs such as pachyonychia congenita and Olmsted syndrome show prevalent pain in PPK lesions. Two mouse models of MdM, Slurp1 knock-out and Slurp2X knock-out, exhibit robust PPK in all four paws. However, whether the sensory experience of these animals includes augmented pain sensitivity remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that both models exhibit hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli as well as spontaneous pain behaviors in males and females. Anatomical analysis revealed slightly reduced glabrous skin epidermal innervation and substantial alterations in palmoplantar skin immune composition in Slurp2X knock-out mice. Primary sensory neurons innervating hindpaw glabrous skin from Slurp2X knock-out mice exhibit increased incidence of spontaneous activity and mechanical hypersensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Slurp knock-out mice exhibit polymodal PPK-associated pain that is associated with both immune alterations and neuronal hyperexcitability and might therefore be useful for the identification of therapeutic targets to treat PPK-associated pain.</p>

                <p>Shank3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein that assists in tethering and organizing structural proteins and glutamatergic receptors in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. The localization of Shank3 at excitatory synapses and the formation of stable Shank3 complexes is regulated by the binding of zinc to the C-terminal sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domain of Shank3. Mutations in the SAM domain of Shank3 result in altered synaptic function and morphology, and disruption of zinc in synapses that express Shank3 leads to a reduction of postsynaptic proteins important for synaptic structure and function. This suggests that zinc supports the localization of postsynaptic proteins via Shank3. Many regions of the brain are highly enriched with free zinc inside glutamatergic vesicles at presynaptic terminals. At these synapses, zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) moves zinc into vesicles where it is co-released with glutamate. Alterations in ZnT3 are implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, and ZnT3 knock-out (KO) mice&mdash;which lack synaptic zinc&mdash;show behavioral deficits associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Here we show that male and female ZnT3 KO mice have smaller dendritic spines and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes than wildtype (WT) mice in the auditory cortex. Additionally, spine size deficits in ZnT3 KO mice are restricted to synapses that express Shank3. In WT mice, synapses that express both Shank3 and ZnT3 have larger spines compared to synapses that express Shank3 but not ZnT3. Together these findings suggest a mechanism whereby presynaptic ZnT3-dependent zinc supports postsynaptic structure and function via Shank3 in a synapse-specific manner.</p>

                <p>Temporal prediction assists language comprehension. In a series of recent behavioral studies, we have shown that listeners specifically employ rhythmic modulations of prosody to estimate the duration of upcoming sentences, thereby speeding up comprehension. In the current human magnetoencephalography (MEG) study on participants of either sex, we show that the human brain achieves this function through a mechanism termed entrainment. Through entrainment, electrophysiological brain activity maintains and continues contextual rhythms beyond their offset. Our experiment combined exposure to repetitive prosodic contours with the subsequent presentation of visual sentences that either matched or mismatched the duration of the preceding contour. During exposure to prosodic contours, we observed MEG coherence with the contours, which was source-localized to right-hemispheric auditory areas. During the processing of the visual targets, activity at the frequency of the preceding contour was still detectable in the MEG; yet sources shifted to the (left) frontal cortex, in line with a functional inheritance of the rhythmic acoustic context for prediction. Strikingly, when the target sentence was shorter than expected from the preceding contour, an omission response appeared in the evoked potential record. We conclude that prosodic entrainment is a functional mechanism of temporal prediction in language comprehension. In general, acoustic rhythms appear to endow language for employing the brain's electrophysiological mechanisms of temporal prediction.</p>

                <p>Tau pathologies are detected in the brains of some of the most common neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau proteins are expressed in six isoforms with either three or four microtubule-binding repeats (3R tau or 4R tau) due to alternative RNA splicing. AD, LBD, and CTE brains contain pathological deposits of both 3R and 4R tau. FTD patients can exhibit either 4R tau pathologies in most cases or 3R tau pathologies less commonly in Pick's disease, which is a subfamily of FTD. Here, we report the isoform-specific roles of tau in FTD. The P301L mutation, linked to familial 4R tau FTD, induces mislocalization of 4R tau to dendritic spines in primary hippocampal cultures that were prepared from neonatal rat pups of both sexes. Contrastingly, the G272V mutation, linked to familial Pick's disease, induces phosphorylation-dependent mislocalization of 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins to dendritic spines. The overexpression of G272V 3R tau but not 4R tau proteins leads to the reduction of dendritic spine density and suppression of mEPSCs in 5-week-old primary rat hippocampal cultures. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude caused by G272V 3R tau is dynamin-dependent whereas that caused by P301L 4R tau is dynamin-independent, indicating that the two tau isoforms activate different signaling pathways responsible for excitatory synaptic dysfunction. Our 3R and 4R tau studies here will shed new light on diverse mechanisms underlying FTD, AD, LBD, and CTE.</p>

                <p>The vagal ganglia, comprised of the superior (jugular) and inferior (nodose) ganglia of the vagus nerve, receive somatosensory information from the head and neck or viscerosensory information from the inner organs, respectively. Developmentally, the cranial neural crest gives rise to all vagal glial cells and to neurons of the jugular ganglia, while the epibranchial placode gives rise to neurons of the nodose ganglia. Crest-derived nodose glial progenitors can additionally generate autonomic neurons in the peripheral nervous system, but how these progenitors generate neurons is unknown. Here, we found that some Sox10+ neural crest-derived cells in, and surrounding, the nodose ganglion transiently expressed Phox2b, a master regulator of autonomic nervous system development, during early embryonic life. Our genetic lineage-tracing analysis in mice of either sex revealed that despite their common developmental origin and extreme spatial proximity, a substantial proportion of glial cells in the nodose, but not in the neighboring jugular ganglia, have a history of Phox2b expression. We used single-cell RNA&ndash;sequencing to demonstrate that these progenitors give rise to all major glial subtypes in the nodose ganglia, including Schwann cells, satellite glia, and glial precursors, and mapped their spatial distribution by in situ hybridization. Lastly, integration analysis revealed transcriptomic similarities between nodose and dorsal root ganglia glial subtypes and revealed immature nodose glial subtypes. Our work demonstrates that these crest-derived nodose glial progenitors transiently express Phox2b, give rise to the entire complement of nodose glial cells, and display a transcriptional program that may underlie their bipotent nature.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptors (NMDARs) may be crucial to working memory (WM). Computational models predict that they sustain neural firing and produce associative memory, which may underpin maintaining and binding information, respectively. We test this in patients with antibodies to NMDAR (<I>n</I> = 10, female) and compare them with healthy control participants (<I>n</I> = 55, 20 male, 35 female). Patients were tested after recovery with a task that separates two aspects of WM: sustaining attention and feature binding. Participants had to remember two colored arrows. Then attention was directed to one of them. After a variable delay, they reported the direction of either the same arrow (congruent cue) or of the other arrow (incongruent cue). We asked how congruency affected recall precision and measured types of error. Patients had difficulty in both sustaining attention to an item over time and feature binding. Controls were less precise after longer delays and incongruent cues. In contrast, patients did not benefit from congruent cues at longer delays [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> congruency (long condition); <I>p</I> = 0.041], indicating they could not sustain attention. Additionally, patients reported the wrong item (misbinding errors) more than controls after congruent cues [group <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> delay (congruent condition), main effect of group; <I>p </I>&le; 0.001]. Our results suggest NMDARs are critical for both maintaining attention and feature binding.</p>

                <p>Congenital single-sided deafness (SSD) leads to an aural preference syndrome that is characterized by overrepresentation of the hearing ear in the auditory system. Cochlear implantation (CI) of the deaf ear is an effective treatment for SSD. However, the newly introduced auditory input in congenital SSD often does not reach expectations in late-implanted CI recipients with respect to binaural hearing and speech perception. In a previous study, a reduction of the interaural time difference (ITD) sensitivity has been shown in unilaterally congenitally deaf cats (uCDCs). In the present study, we focused on the interaural level difference (ILD) processing in the primary auditory cortex. The uCDC group was compared with hearing cats (HCs) and bilaterally congenitally deaf cats (CDCs). The ILD representation was reorganized, replacing the preference for the contralateral ear with a preference for the hearing ear, regardless of the cortical hemisphere. In accordance with the previous study, uCDCs were less sensitive to interaural time differences than HCs, resulting in unmodulated ITD responses, thus lacking directional information. Such incongruent ITDs and ILDs cannot be integrated for binaural sound source localization. In normal hearing, the predominant effect of each ear is excitation of the auditory cortex in the contralateral cortical hemisphere and inhibition in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In SSD, however, auditory pathways reorganized such that the hearing ear produced greater excitation in both cortical hemispheres and the deaf ear produced weaker excitation and preserved inhibition in both cortical hemispheres.</p>

                <p>Chronic sleep disruption (CSD), from insufficient or fragmented sleep and is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Underlying mechanisms are not understood. CSD in mice results in degeneration of locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) and CA1 hippocampal neurons and increases hippocampal amyloid-&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> (A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB>), entorhinal cortex (EC) tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and glial reactivity. LCn injury is increasingly implicated in AD pathogenesis. CSD increases NE turnover in LCn, and LCn norepinephrine (NE) metabolism activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), an enzyme known to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau into neurotoxic fragments. We hypothesized that CSD would activate LCn AEP in an NE-dependent manner to induce LCn and hippocampal injury. Here, we studied LCn, hippocampal, and EC responses to CSD in mice deficient in NE [dopamine &beta;-hydroxylase (<I>Dbh</I>)<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>] and control male and female mice, using a model of chronic fragmentation of sleep (CFS). Sleep was equally fragmented in <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and control male and female mice, yet only <I>Dbh</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice conferred resistance to CFS loss of LCn, LCn p-tau, and LCn AEP upregulation and activation as evidenced by an increase in AEP-cleaved APP and tau fragments. Absence of NE also prevented a CFS increase in hippocampal AEP-APP and A&beta;<SUB>42</SUB> but did not prevent CFS-increased AEP-tau and p-tau in the EC. Collectively, this work demonstrates AEP activation by CFS, establishes key roles for NE in both CFS degeneration of LCn neurons and CFS promotion of forebrain A&beta; accumulation, and, thereby, identifies a key molecular link between CSD and specific AD neural injuries.</p>

                <p>The zebrafish, a widely used model in neurobiology, relies on hearing in aquatic environments. Unfortunately, its auditory pathways have mainly been studied in larvae. In this study, we examined the involvement of the anterior tuberal nucleus (AT) in auditory processing in adult zebrafish. Our tract-tracing experiments revealed that the dorsal subdivision of AT is strongly bidirectionally connected to the central nucleus of the torus semicircularis (TSc), a major auditory nucleus in fishes. Immunohistochemical visualization of the ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) phosphorylation to map neural activity in response to auditory stimulation substantiated this finding: the dorsal but not the ventral part of AT responded strongly to auditory stimulation. A similar response to auditory stimulation was present in the TSc but not in the nucleus isthmi, a visual region, which we used as a control for testing if the pS6 activation was specific to the auditory stimulation. We also measured the time course of pS6 phosphorylation, which was previously unreported in teleost fish. After auditory stimulation, we found that pS6 phosphorylation peaked between 100 and 130&nbsp;min and returned to baseline levels after 190&nbsp;min. This information will be valuable for the design of future pS6 experiments. Our results suggest an anatomical and functional subdivision of AT, where only the dorsal part connects to the auditory network and processes auditory information.</p>

                <p>Epilepsy is often comorbid with psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Despite the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, few studies address the underlying mechanisms. Stress can trigger epilepsy and depression. Evidence from human and animal studies supports that hypothalamic&ndash;pituitary&ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to both disorders and their comorbidity (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B16">Kanner, 2003</cross-ref>). Here, we investigate if HPA axis dysfunction may influence epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. We generated a novel mouse model (<I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice) lacking the K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> cotransporter, KCC2, in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which exhibit stress- and seizure-induced HPA axis hyperactivation (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Melon et al., 2018</cross-ref>). We used the <I>Kcc2</I>/<I>Crh</I> KO mice to examine the impact on epilepsy outcomes, including seizure frequency/burden, comorbid behavioral deficits, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk. We found sex differences in HPA axis dysfunction&rsquo;s effect on chronically epileptic KCC2/Crh KO mice seizure burden, vulnerability to comorbid behavioral deficits, and SUDEP. Suppressing HPA axis hyperexcitability in this model using pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches decreased SUDEP incidence, suggesting that HPA axis dysfunction may contribute to SUDEP. Altered neuroendocrine markers were present in SUDEP cases compared with people with epilepsy or individuals without epilepsy. Together, these findings implicate HPA axis dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and SUDEP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-788/v1?src=rss">Cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions (HEIs): A literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Cheating and plagiarism have become serious problems in higher education institutions (HEIs). It affects educational quality as well as the reputation of higher education. The purpose of this study is to identify the most prevalent types of cheating and plagiarism, as well as the elements that contribute to cheating and plagiarism, and to present solutions to this recurring problem. This paper systematically reviews 45 articles published from 2018, to 2022, aligned with the PRISMA guidelines in the selection, filtering, and reporting of the papers. This review shows that factors such as increased pressure on students, poor academic integrity awareness, lack of up-to-date academic honor codes, and the unethical application of AI tools are prime contributing factors to cheating and plagiarism in HEIs. In a broader sense, all these factors are classified as individual, social, cultural, institutional, and technological factors that are responsible for this problem. This problem can be reduced by establishing ethical and moral development tutorials as well as formulating up-to-date honor codes considering AI tools. Furthermore, higher education institutions must develop anti-plagiarism detection software in order to detect plagiarism and aid students in improving academic writing and paraphrasing approaches. The findings of this systematic literature review provide useful insights for educators and policymakers to solve the complicated issue of cheating and plagiarism in higher education institutions.

Dimension reduction tools preserving similarity and graph structure such as <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP can capture complex biological patterns in high-dimensional data. However, these tools typically are not designed to separate effects of interest from unwanted effects due to confounders. We introduce the partial embedding (PARE) framework, which enables removal of confounders from any distance-based dimension reduction method. We then develop partial <i>t</i>-SNE and partial UMAP and apply these methods to genomic and neuroimaging data. For lower-dimensional visualization, our results show that the PARE framework can remove batch effects in single-cell sequencing data as well as separate clinical and technical variability in neuroimaging measures. We demonstrate that the PARE framework extends dimension reduction methods to highlight biological patterns of interest while effectively removing confounding effects.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012240">Jointly efficient encoding and decoding in neural populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simone Blanco Malerba, Aurora Micheli, Michael Woodford, Rava Azeredo da Silveira</p>

The efficient coding approach proposes that neural systems represent as much sensory information as biological constraints allow. It aims at formalizing encoding as a constrained optimal process. A different approach, that aims at formalizing decoding, proposes that neural systems instantiate a generative model of the sensory world. Here, we put forth a normative framework that characterizes neural systems as jointly optimizing encoding and decoding. It takes the form of a variational autoencoder: sensory stimuli are encoded in the noisy activity of neurons to be interpreted by a flexible decoder; encoding must allow for an accurate stimulus reconstruction from neural activity. Jointly, neural activity is required to represent the statistics of latent features which are mapped by the decoder into distributions over sensory stimuli; decoding correspondingly optimizes the accuracy of the generative model. This framework yields in a family of encoding-decoding models, which result in equally accurate generative models, indexed by a measure of the stimulus-induced deviation of neural activity from the marginal distribution over neural activity. Each member of this family predicts a specific relation between properties of the sensory neurons—such as the arrangement of the tuning curve means (preferred stimuli) and widths (degrees of selectivity) in the population—as a function of the statistics of the sensory world. Our approach thus generalizes the efficient coding approach. Notably, here, the form of the constraint on the optimization derives from the requirement of an accurate generative model, while it is arbitrary in efficient coding models. Moreover, solutions do not require the knowledge of the stimulus distribution, but are learned on the basis of data samples; the constraint further acts as regularizer, allowing the model to generalize beyond the training data. Finally, we characterize the family of models we obtain through alternate measures of performance, such as the error in stimulus reconstruction. We find that a range of models admits comparable performance; in particular, a population of sensory neurons with broad tuning curves as observed experimentally yields both low reconstruction stimulus error and an accurate generative model that generalizes robustly to unseen data.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002655">A molecularly defined subpopulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes during postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shayan Moghimyfiroozabad, Maela A. Paul, Lea Bellenger, Fekrije Selimi</p>

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are a class of glial cells that uniformly tiles the entire central nervous system (CNS). They play several key functions across the brain including the generation of oligodendrocytes and the control of myelination. Whether the functional diversity of OPCs is the result of genetically defined subpopulations or of their regulation by external factors has not been definitely established. We discovered that a subpopulation of OPCs found across the brain is defined by the expression of <i>C1ql1</i>, a gene previously described for its synaptic function in neurons. This subpopulation starts to appear during the first postnatal week in the mouse cortex. Ablation of <i>C1ql1</i>-expressing OPCs in the mouse leads to a massive lack of oligodendrocytes and myelination in many brain regions. This deficit cannot be rescued, even though some OPCs escape <i>Sox10</i>-driven ablation and end up partially compensating the OPC loss in the adult. Therefore, <i>C1ql1</i> is a molecular marker of a functionally non-redundant subpopulation of OPCs, which controls the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes.

                Introduction Getting acceptable cosmetic results in the soft tissues of the face serves as the foundation for orthodontic treatment planning. Also, in order to achieve healthy static and dynamic occlusal interactions, the teeth must be positioned within the basal bone at the correct position, angle, and inclination. To avoid periodontal issues, provide stability, and achieve a functional occlusion, it is essential to ascertain the individual’s dental arch form before starting of treatment and thus to utilise the mechanics that follow throughout the treatment. Objectives To evaluate and compare variation in Curve of Spee and Curve of Wilson in Class II Div.-1, Class II-Div-2 and Class-III as against Class I malocclusion in central India population. Methodology Irreversible hydrocolloid impression will be taken with perforated metal stock trays and stone cast will be poured. This will be scanned using CAD CAM machine and curve of Spee and Wilson will be measured using reverse engineering. Expected Result It will assist us in treatment planning for preventing periodontal issues, assuring stability, and achieving functional occlusion by evaluating and comparing the Spee and Wilson curves in Class II Divison-1, Class II Divison-2, and Class-III malocclusion with Class-I malocclusion. Conclusion Every single patient receiving orthodontic treatment has the COS, which is crucial to achieving a stable occlusion. Almost every patient who receives orthodontic treatment eventually experiences the Spee Curve. Since there aren’t many studies examining the relationship between the Curves of Spee and Wilson, their impact on dentoskeletal morphology, and their role in occlusal stability.
