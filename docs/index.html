">Mapping neurogenetic characteristics of psychopathological procrastination using normative modeling in a prospective twin cohort</a></h4>

              
                Procrastination, affecting over 70% global population, is pervasively incurring negative outcomes in human society. This has long been studied as a bad daily habit, but it loses in delineating neurogenetic substrates underlying its psychopathological phenotyping. Using a prospective twin adolescent cohort, we demonstrate moderate heritability of this subclinical condition - PPS. Neuroimaging normative modeling analysis, further reveals that neurodevelopmental deviations in nucleus accumbens during adolescence, are predictive of PPS in adulthood, while such deviations-PPS mappings were highly genetically shared . Beyond to regional anomalies, PPS-specific whole-brain deviation patterns, notably in the default mode network, are neurobiologically enriched with changes in cortical manifolds (gradients) and neurotransmitter systems. Integrating these neuroimaging markers with transcriptomic atlas, we capture significant PPS-specific neurogenetic signatures associated with molecular transport system, neuroimmune responses, and neuroinflammation, particularly in serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. These findings shed light on the multisystem neurogenetic architecture underlying PPS, providing evidence to theoretically conceptualize this psychopathological phenotype as a subclinical "brain disorder".

">Ketogenic diet dampens excitatory neurotransmission by shrinking synaptic vesicle pools</a></h4>

              
                The ketogenic diet (KD) is a common dietary intervention for treating seizures in intractable childhood epilepsies and has been proposed to improve disease outcome in neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its clinical applications, we know little about how this diet impacts brain circuitry and neuronal function to elicit its protective effects. Here, we examined the impact of the KD on hippocampal function through integrative analysis of gene expression, epigenetics and neurotransmission. We found that KD induces profound transcriptional reprogramming of the hippocampus, including dampened expression of numerous synaptic genes. Through proteomic analysis of histone variants and post-translational modifications, we uncovered significant changes in activating and repressive histone marks in the hippocampus of KD mice. To determine how transcriptional rewiring of the hippocampus under KD impacts neurotransmission, we performed electrophysiological recordings of neurotransmission and synaptic dynamics at excitatory CA3-CA1 synapses. We found that KD diminishes synaptic gain and dampens short-term plasticity at excitatory synapses, resulting in reduced integration of synaptic inputs at the circuit level. Combining electrophysiology and electron microscopy, we determined that effects of KD in excitatory synapses are caused by a reduction in size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, as well as the total vesicle pool. Our findings show that the ketogenic diet triggers synaptic remodeling in the hippocampus, driven by broad transcriptional and epigenetic changes that reduce synaptic vesicle pools and short-term plasticity at excitatory synapses ultimately dampening excitatory synaptic gain and integration at the circuit level. These synaptic adaptations may represent a major mechanism underlying the anti-epileptic effects of this diet.

">Direct electrical stimulation of the human amygdala enhances recognition memory for objects but not scenes</a></h4>

              
                Research from neuroscience studies using invasive neuroanatomy-inspired direct manipulations suggests the basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates a generalized modulation of many different types of memory. In contrast, noninvasive, psychology-inspired indirect correlations suggest that specificity exists in how the BLA prioritizes experiences in memory. We used direct electrical stimulation of the BLA to investigate the specificity of the memory enhancement in the human brain. Patients undergoing intracranial monitoring via depth electrodes viewed object and scene images, half of which were followed by BLA stimulation. Stimulation enhanced long-term memory for object but not scene images. Furthermore, BLA stimulation elicited stronger evoked responses in the anterior vs. posterior medial temporal lobe (MTL), regions that preferentially process object and scene learning, respectively. These results suggest the BLA exerts an important influence over the specificity of what information is prioritized in memory, rather than a general enhancement of all memory, and provide insight into how BLA-MTL projections contribute to the dynamics of memory prioritization.

">Different Multiword Verb Categories are Processed Differentially in the Brain: An Evidence from EEG Analysis and Decoding</a></h4>

              
                The mental representation of multiword verb constructions is a central question in neurolinguistics: are they stored as single lexical units or completely compositional items? This study investigates the neurocognitive processing of two multiword verb types: phrasal verbs (e.g., look up) and prepositional verbs (e.g., decide on). Taking in consideration verb-to-infinitive constructions (e.g., want to go) as a control group. We analyse event-related potentials from eleven native English speakers who completed a listening task while EEG data were recorded. Grand-averaged waveforms and root-mean-square amplitudes were analysed across four-time windows. Therefore, statistical comparisons showed a significantly larger N400 amplitudes for prepositional verbs compared to phrasal verbs, while no significant differences were found between prepositional and to-infinitive constructions. Multivariate pattern analyses confirmed neural discriminability between phrasal and prepositional verbs, but not between prepositional and verb-to-infinitive structures. These results confirm that prepositional and verb-to-infinitive constructions are processed compositionally via valency-based integration, whereas phrasal verbs are stored as lexicalized units. The findings support a theoretical model in which multiword verb constructions differ in their degree of lexicalization, with measurable consequences for real-time neural processing.

">BARTharm: MRI Harmonization Using Image Quality Metrics and Bayesian Non-parametric</a></h4>

              
                Image derived phenotypes (IDPs) harmonization from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is essential for reducing scanner-induced, non-biological variability and enabling accurate multi-site analysis. Existing methods like ComBat, while widely used, rely on linear assumptions and explicit scanner IDs - limitations that reduce their effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving complex scanner effects, non-linear biological variation, or anonymized data. We introduce BARTharm, a novel harmonization framework that uses Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) instead of Scanner IDs and models scanner and biological effects separately using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), allowing for flexible, data-driven adjustment of IDPs. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that IQMs provide a more informative and flexible representation of scanner-related variation than categorical Scanner IDs, enabling more accurate removal of non-biological effects. Leveraging this and its ability to model complex relationships, BARTharm, consistently outperforms ComBat across a range of challenging scenarios, including model misspecification and confounded scanner-biological relationships. Applied to real-world datasets, BARTharm successfully removes scanner-induced bias while preserving meaningful biological signals, resulting in stronger, more reliable associations with clinical outcomes. Overall, we find that BARTharm is a robust, data-driven improvement over traditional harmonization approaches, particularly suited for modern, large-scale neuroimaging studies.

">Localization of Realistic Spatial Patches of Complex Source Activity in MEG</a></h4>

              
                Accurate localization of neural sources in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) is essential for advancing clinical and research applications in neuroscience. Traditional approaches like dipole fitting (e.g., MUSIC, RAP-MUSIC) are limited to discrete focal sources, while distributed source imaging methods (e.g., MNE, sLORETA) assume sources distributed across the cortical surface. These methods, however, often fail to capture sources with complex spatial extents, limiting their accuracy in realistic settings. To address these limitations, we introduce PATCH-AP, an enhanced version of the Alternating Projection (AP) method that effectively localizes both discrete and spatially extended sources. We evaluated PATCH-AP against leading source localization methods, including distributed source imaging techniques (MNE, sLORETA), traditional dipole fitting (AP), and recent extended source methods (Convexity-Champagne (CC), FLEX-AP). PATCH-AP consistently outperformed these methods in simulations, achieving lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) scores a metric indicating closer alignment with the true source distribution. In tests with real MEG data from a face perception task, PATCH-AP demonstrated high alignment with the fusiform face area, a region critical for face processing. These results highlight PATCH-AP's potential to enhance source localization accuracy, promising significant advancements in neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics.

">High reelin expression can explain why the entorhinal cortex is a cradle for Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a crucial role in memory functions. Long before the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerge, it has already undergone significant degeneration, making it a primary site for the onset of the disease. The reasons for this remain elusive. It was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alECLII neurons), which are especially prone to display a very early increase in intracellular amounts of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), the large glycoprotein reelin binds to A{beta}, suggesting that reelin functions as a sink for intracellular A{beta}. The expression of reelin is extraordinarily high in alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons. Here, we show by computational modeling that, in a senescent physiology predisposing to frequent inflammation-driven A{beta}42 production bursts, the intracellular amount of A{beta}42-reelin complexes can accumulate to extraordinarily high levels in alECLII neurons compared to the vast majority of cortical neurons. This explains experimental data showing that intracellular accumulations of A{beta}42 positive material ranged from 20 to 80% of the total cytoplasmic volume in EC neurons from patients with sporadic AD. We also show that this extreme intracellular aggregation can cause the accumulation of detrimental hyperphosphorylated tau fragments. Thus, when exposed to recurrent AD-promoting stress, the exceptionally high expression of reelin in alECLII neurons appears to be instrumental in their early demise relative to other cortical neurons.

">Interindividual differences in predicting words versus sentence meaning:Explaining N400 amplitudes using large-scale neural network models</a></h4>

              
                Prediction error, both at the level of sentence meaning and at the level of the next presented word, has been shown to successfully account for N400 amplitudes. Here we address the question of whether people differ in the representational level at which they implicitly predict upcoming language. To this end, we compute a measure of prediction error at the level of sentence meaning (magnitude of change in hidden layer activation, termed semantic update, in a neural network model of sentence comprehension, the Sentence Gestalt model) and a measure of prediction error at the level of the next presented word (surprisal from a next word prediction language model). When using both measures to predict N400 amplitudes during the reading of naturalistic texts, results showed that both measures significantly accounted for N400 amplitudes even when the other measure was controlled for. Most important for current purposes, both effects were significantly negatively correlated such that people with a reversed or weak surprisal effect showed the strongest influence of semantic update on N400 amplitudes, and random-effects model comparison showed that individuals differ in whether their N400 amplitudes are driven by semantic update only, by surprisal only, or by both, and that the most common model in the population was either semantic update or the combined model but clearly not the pure surprisal model. The current approach of combining large-scale models implementing different theoretical accounts with advanced model comparison techniques enables fine-grained investigations into the computational processes underlying N400 amplitudes, including interindividual differences.

">Hippocampal reactivation of aversive experience enables safety learning and slow-breathing state for recovery from stress</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive threat responses require both defensive behaviours to minimize danger and recovering from the induced physiological stress. However, the behavioural and neural basis of these recuperative strategies are still elusive. Using a novel two-location fear conditioning paradigm in mice, we have identified a slow-breathing immobility state of recovery that emerges when animals identify safe environments after threat avoidance. This immobile state was characterized by a 2-4 Hz breathing profile and replay of the aversive experience in the hippocampus. Suppressing hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) inhibited the emergence of this recovery state, suggesting their role in learning safe locations. Anxiolysis with diazepam directly promoted the recovery state while suppressing SWRs, showing this treatment to be a double-edged sword that facilitates immediate relief but impairs long-term safety learning. These results demonstrate the importance of hippocampal replay for emotional resilience through its role in recovery.

">Development of a network formation assay for developmental neurotoxicity hazard screening using 3D human iPSC derived BrainSpheres</a></h4>

              
                Exposure of the developing brain to environmental neurotoxicants can result in permanent alterations in structure and/or function. To investigate the effects of chemical exposures on neurodevelopment, the human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural BrainSphere model has been utilized due to its ability to form mature neuronal populations and exhibit spontaneous electrical activity. To model network formation for developmental neurotoxicity screening, developing BrainSpheres were plated on high-density microelectrode arrays (hdMEA) three weeks after beginning differentiation. Starting two days post-plating, BrainSpheres were treated three times per week with compounds known to disrupt in vitro network formation (i.e. assay positive controls; loperamide, dieldrin and deltamethrin), or with an assay negative control, glyphosate, expected to have no effect. For 29 days, BrainSphere activity was recorded to measure neural network activity, general activity, and features of action potential propagation. Concentration-dependent disruption in neural network formation was observed for positive controls at concentrations below cytotoxicity. Dieldrin, deltamethrin, and loperamide exposure disrupted several features of general activity, neural network formation, and action potential propagation. BrainSpheres on hdMEAs detected chemically induced perturbations in neural network formation and may represent a valuable complex in vitro model useful for developmental neurotoxicity screening.

">Ablation of VEGFA following a lumbar intervertebral disc injury attenuates intradiscal neurovascular features and prevents chronic low back pain symptoms</a></h4>

              
                There are currently no therapies for the staggering disability and public health costs of chronic low back pain (LBP). Innervation of the degenerating intervertebral disc (IVD) is suspected to cause discogenic LBP, but the mechanisms that orchestrate the IVD's neo-innervation and subsequent symptoms of LBP remain unknown. We hypothesize that Vascular Growth Endothelial Factor-A (VEGFA) critically mediates the neurite invasion in the IVD and contributes to prolonged LBP. Initiating IVD degeneration through a mechanical injury, we evaluated the progression of neurovascular features into the IVD, as well as resultant LBP symptoms and locomotive performance at acute (3-weeks) and prolonged (12-weeks) time points following IVD injury. To determine the role of VEGFA, we used a mouse model with ubiquitous inducible recombination of the floxed VEGFA allele (UBC-CreERT2; VEGFAfl/fl). The ablation of VEGFA attenuated the neurite and vessel infiltration into the degenerating IVD, and the VEGFA-null animals exhibited alleviated mechanical allodynia and improved locomotive performance. To determine the effects of IVD-derived VEGFA on endothelial cells and neurons, we cultured HMEC-1 endothelial cells and SH-SY5Y neurons using conditioned media from VEGFA-silenced (siRNA) human primary IVD cells stimulated by IL1b. The endothelial cells and neurons exposed to the secretome of the VEGFA-silenced IVD cells exhibited reduced growth, suggesting that the inhibition of IVD-derived VEGFA may be sufficient to attenuate intradiscal neurovascular features. Together, we show that VEGFA orchestrates the growth of intradiscal vessels and neurites that cause low back pain and impaired function, and the inhibition of VEGFA can prevent prolonged low back pain.

">A New Pathway for the Decussation of Corticospinal Tracts</a></h4>

              
                Each brain hemisphere controls the movements of the opposite side of the body because the motor axons cross the midline, known as CST decussation. The current theory on CST decussation suggests CSTs decussate as a single tract at the junction between medulla and spinal cord. Although this theory is widely accepted, this theory is based on selective analyses and is therefore incomplete. Here, we employed new approaches, including the horizontal analyses and a non-invasive anterograde tracing method to examine CST decussation thoroughly. We analyzed all CS axons in 3 planes. These approaches led to the discovery of a new pathway for CST decussation. We found CSTs turned back to medulla, moving anteriorly and decussated in an oval structure. In this structure, each CST split into 4 fascicle groups and interdigitated with the corresponding groups from the opposite CST to cross the midline. The significance of this pathway was apparent after decussation where these 4 groups reversed direction, moving posteriorly toward spinal cord. While moving, the motor axons gradually separated at different locations and subsequently turned and occupied the correct positions in the dorsal funiculus for proper limb control. In addition to CSTs, we also characterized several components in the oval structure.

">Stochastic Misfolding Drives the Emergence of Distinct α-Synuclein Strains</a></h4>

              
                The existence of -synuclein conformational strains provides a potential explanation for the clinical and pathological differences among synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. However, how distinct -synuclein strains are formed in vivo remains unknown. Here, we examined whether unique strains of self-propagating -synuclein aggregates can arise within a consistent molecular environment. Unexpectedly, we observed conformational heterogeneity between individual preparations of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated by polymerizing recombinant wild-type or A53T-mutant human -synuclein under identical conditions. Moreover, we found that -synuclein aggregates formed spontaneously in the brains of a transgenic synucleinopathy mouse model were conformationally diverse, leading to the identification of three distinct disease subtypes. Propagation of putative PFF- and brain-derived -synuclein strains in mice initiated several distinct synucleinopathies, characterized by differences in disease onset times, cerebral -synuclein deposition patterns, and the conformational attributes of -synuclein aggregates. The conformational diversity of -synuclein aggregates across PFF preparations and between the brains of individual transgenic mice demonstrates that -synuclein can spontaneously form multiple self-propagating strains within an identical environment both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that stochastic misfolding into distinct aggregate structures drives the emergence of -synuclein strains and implies that the intrinsic variability of common synucleinopathy research tools must be considered when designing and interpreting experiments.

">Parkinson's disease-vulnerable and -resilient dopamine neurons display opposite responses to excitatory input</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) are essential for motor control and selectively degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, DA neurons are molecularly heterogeneous, with some showing greater vulnerability and others resilience. Here, we show that the DA subtype marker Anxa1, identified in mice, labels PD-vulnerable DA neurons in human SN. Using mice, we found that excitatory inputs from subthalamic (STN) and pedunculopontine (PPN) nuclei evoked frequency dependent excitation in SN GABA neurons, but complex multiphasic DA neuron responses, suggesting heterogeneous DA subtype responses. Indeed, excitatory inputs evoked differential DA responses in striatal subregions, an increase in caudal striatum, but inhibition followed by rebound in dorsolateral striatum. Additionally, PD resilient Vglut2+ DA neurons were excited by STN/PPN input, while vulnerable Anxa1+ DA neurons were inhibited. These findings demonstrate that DA subtypes are embedded in distinct functional networks, suggesting that some therapeutic interventions may differentially impact vulnerable and resilient DA subtypes.

">LINE-1 replication in a mouse TDP-43 model of neurodegeneration marks motor cortex neurons for cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous programmed cell death.</a></h4>

              
                A key pathological feature of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is the loss of nuclear localization and the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.

">A conserved Arf-GEF modulates axonal integrity through RAB-35 by altering neuron-epidermal attachment</a></h4>

              
                Neurites of sensory neurons densely innervate the skin and are embedded within it. These delicate structures are exposed to acute and chronic mechanical strain and yet their integrity is maintained throughout life. Although evidence suggests a neuroprotective role for the skin, the molecular pathways involved are still poorly understood. In C. elegans, the cytoskeletal molecule UNC-70/{beta}-spectrin functions in synergy with the small GTPase RAB-35 within the skin to stabilize neuron-epidermal attachment structures against mechanical strain and prevent movement-induced damage to mechanosensitive axons. However, the full suite of molecules regulating these specialized attachments remains elusive. Here, through an unbiased forward genetic screen we have identified a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) previously associated with the endocytic-recycling machinery, AGEF-1a, that impacts axonal maintenance. We show that AGEF-1a functions selectively within the skin to regulate the integrity of the embedded axons. Mechanistically, we reveal that this effect is achieved through an interaction between AGEF-1a and epidermal RAB-35 to facilitate its activation, which in turn modulates the neuron-epidermal attachments. Finally, we demonstrate that the function of this GEF is highly conserved, with the expression of its human ortholog, BIG2 capable of replacing AGEF-1a. Together, we reveal the specific molecular machinery responsible for fine-tuning neuron-epidermal attachments and maintaining axonal integrity during life.

">Lack of mRNA Methylation in Schwann Cells Results in Demyelination and Regenerative Failure</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells are essential for peripheral nerve myelination and regeneration. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, regulated by methyltransferase-like 14 (Mettl14), is a critical post-transcriptional modification, but its role in Schwann cell biology remains unclear. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we investigated the impact of Mettl14-mediated m6A methylation on Schwann cells. Mice born with Schwann cell-specific genetic deletion of Mettl14 developed normally but starting in young adulthood exhibited progressive motor deficits, severe demyelination, and axonal degeneration, confirmed by behavioral assessments and histological analyses. Mettl14-deficient Schwann cells displayed impaired proliferation and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. Following sciatic nerve injury, Mettl14 cKO mice showed defective macrophage recruitment, slowed axonal degeneration, and impaired regeneration. These findings suggest that Mettl14-mediated m6A methylation is critical for Schwann cell maintenance but not development. Given that Mettl14 cKO mice developed a demyelinating polyneuropathy, it is possible that manipulation of m6A methylation in Schwann cells is a promising therapeutic strategy targeting peripheral nerve repair and myelination.

">Respiratory coordination of excitability states across the human wake-sleep cycle</a></h4>

              
                While the respiratory rhythm is increasingly recognized as a key modulator of oscillatory brain activity across the wake-sleep cycle in humans, very little is known about its influence on aperiodic brain activity during sleep. This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep.

">Impairment in axonal translation and cytoplasmic viscosity during aging in sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are trafficked along axons and provide the energy required for several intracellular mechanisms including molecular transport and local translation, which is believed to contribute to the homeostasis of the axonal compartment. Decline in mitochondria activity is one of the hallmarks of aging. It is still unclear, though, whether this decline corresponds to a concomitant reduction in the extent of axonal translation during aging. Using live cell imaging of sensory neurons, we found a significant decrease in the number of active mitochondria and the percentage of mitochondria localized to axons in aged mice compared to young mice. This decrease was mirrored by a loss of intracellular ATP as well as an ATP-dependent decrease in axoplasmic viscosity. In addition, the size of G3BP1 positive axonal granules and the number of FMRP axonal granules increased. Cumulatively, we found a functional decrease in the overall level of axonal translation in aged neurons. We were able to rescue this effect by increasing ATP synthesis, which induced a global decrease in axoplasmic viscosity, while promoting RNA granule solubilization and boosting axonal translation. Proteomic analysis of newly synthesized proteins in axons of aged vs young neurons revealed a dysregulation of pathways related to axonal biology and growth. We identified MAP1B and STAT3 as proteins whose axonal local synthesis was impaired in aged axons, and more notably show that this impairment could be rescued by increasing ATP synthesis. We believe that this research sheds light on axonal translation in aged neurons and its relationship with energy sources inside the axonal compartment, possibly presenting an opportunity for future therapeutics.

">Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels confer tonotopic specialization for temporal encoding of sound frequency in the cochlear nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons are equipped with physiological properties vital for accurate signal processing. The functional importance of such properties is exemplified in auditory circuits where intrinsic excitability is optimized to detect frequency-specific features. In birds, the neurons of nucleus magnocellularis (NM) receive primary auditory input (Rubel and Parks, 1975a; Parks and Rubel, 1978; Jackson et al., 1982) and are arranged tonotopically. NM comprises a superficially homogenous neural population, but several physiological properties vary systematically along its tonotopic frequency axis. In particular, expression of voltage-gated conductances plays a pivotal role in creating selectivity that enables temporal precision. Here, we identify a previously undescribed gradient of hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (IH). Whole cell patch clamp techniques and immunostaining for HCN1, an IH channel subunit, demonstrated an expression gradient corresponding to NM's tonotopic axis. To investigate the function of tonotopic IH expression in NM, we applied a depolarizing ramp injection protocol to measure the impact of pharmacologically blocking IH on neural active properties (Ferragamo and Oertel, 2002; McGinley and Oertel, 2006; Oline et al. 2016). Next, we investigated whether this tonotopic patterning of HCN facilitates encoding of temporally patterned inputs. We injected depolarizing current pulse trains before and during HCN channel block. During pharmacological block, there was a reduction of NM spike entrainment to input pulses suggesting a key contribution of HCN channels to NM's ability to encode its synaptic drive. Results show that there is tonotopic distribution of HCN channels in NM which provides a novel mechanism that enables NM neurons to encode temporally patterned excitatory input.

">Frequency tagging evidence supports perceptual separation of rapid stimuli in human fetuses</a></h4>

              
                In early human development, perceptual processes grow faster with maturation, as inferred using the duration of the attentional blink and multisensory integration window. The consequences of this developmental trend for sensory-cognition in fetuses are unclear: does the fetus perceive rapid stimuli as discrete events or, rather, one fused stimulus? We addressed this question using frequency tagging in two experiments with rapid auditory stimuli while neural responses were recorded in the third trimester with fetal magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our results are the first successful demonstration of frequency tagging in the fetal MEG amplitude spectrum and show that the fetal cortex generates separate neural responses to discrete auditory stimuli in both experiments, and similar results were also obtained when one experiment was repeated in newborns. While we cannot rule out perceptual fusion of rapid stimuli in higher-order association cortices, our results weaken the hypothesis that fetuses fuse rapid auditory stimuli into a single prolonged percept. Finally, our work points to frequency tagging analysis as a solution which avoids the uncertainties surrounding immature neural response latencies in time-domain analysis of fetal MEG.

">Stress induces distinct social behavior states encoded by the ventral hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                A single, acute traumatic experience can result in a host of negative impacts on behavior, such as increased violence, reduced sociability, and exaggerated fear responses. Despite the large body of research on the neurobiology of stress, we have a poor understanding of how trauma rewires social circuits in the brain. To identify how social circuits are re-organized by stress, we interrogated the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a key node for both the orchestration of emotionally-relevant behavior and the integration of sensory information. Using a footshock-based model of traumatic stress, we established that a single exposure to a series of unpredictable, inescapable footshocks was sufficient to negatively alter social behavior, resulting in increased violence and social hesitancy. Critically, we found that stress-induced changes to social behavior engaged neural ensembles in the VH, a critical node in the regulation of emotion states. Using a virally-mediated, activity-dependent cellular tagging approach to label two neural ensembles activated by temporally distinct experiences, we were surprised to find that stress-induced violence and stress-induced social hesitancy recruited largely non-overlapping populations of cells in the VH, in contrast to higher degrees of ensemble overlap in unstressed control mice, suggesting that stress biases the brain towards stronger differentiation of distinct social states. Additionally, we found that activity of VH neurons was required for stress-induced aggression. Finally, we found that stress-induced changes to social behaviors and VH activity profiles could be reversed by the introduction of social buffering post-stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that stress drives the VH to dissociably encode specific behavioral states, rather than a single state of negative valence, consistent with a role for multiple structures and distributed ensembles in the modulation of traumatic stress.

                Speech production is supported by sensory-to-motor transformations to coordinate activity of the larynx and orofacial muscles. Here, we show that lesions to left temporal lobe areas involved in pitch processing cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences and when humming piano melodies in a dorsal portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to laryngeal motor control. In contrast, lesions to left inferior parietal areas involved in somatosensory processing of speech cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences but not when humming piano melodies in a ventral portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to orofacial motor control. Analyses in neurotypical participants converge in showing that the dorsal and ventral portions of the left precentral gyrus exhibit strong functional connectivity to left temporal and inferior parietal regions, respectively. These results provide causal lesion evidence that dissociable networks underlie distinct sensory-to-motor transformations supporting laryngeal and orofacial motor control for speech production.

">Convergent and divergent brain-cognition relationships during development revealed by cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                How brain networks and cognition co-evolve during development remains poorly understood. Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.

                <p>Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual tasks and whether neural correlates before or after the primary decision contribute to self-reported confidence. This focus has been useful, yet the reliance on subjective confidence reports may confound our understanding of key everyday features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions must be rapidly evaluated without explicit feedback and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations led us to hypothesize that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (<I>N</I> = 21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual task generalized to distinguish correct and error trials in the subsequent nonspeeded auditory discrimination. This generalization did not occur for classifiers trained on the visual stimulus-locked data and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping post-response neural activity provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>Rod and cone photoreceptor cells selectively contact different compartments of axon-bearing retinal horizontal cells in the mammalian retina. Cones synapse exclusively on the soma whereas rods synapse exclusively on a large axon terminal compartment. The possibility that rod signals can travel down the axon from terminal to soma has been proposed as a means of producing spectrally opponent interactions between rods and cones, but there is conflicting data about whether this actually occurs. The spectral overlap between rods and cones in mouse makes it difficult to stimulate rod and cone pigments separately. We therefore used optogenetic techniques to analyze photoreceptor inputs into horizontal somas by selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in rods and/or cones. Optogenetic stimulation of rods and cones both evoked large fast inward currents in horizontal cell somas. Cone-driven responses were abolished by eliminating synaptic release in a cone-specific knock-out of the exocytotic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, rod-driven responses in horizontal somas were unchanged after eliminating synaptic release from rods but abolished by eliminating release from both rods and cones. This suggests that release from cones is required for transmission of rod signals to horizontal cell somas. Rods and cones are coupled by Cx36 gap junctions, and we found that selective elimination of Cx36 from rods also abolished rod-driven optogenetic responses in horizontal cell somas. Together, these results show that rod signals reach the somas of B-type horizontal cells exclusively via gap junctions with cones and not by transmission down the axon from the axon terminal.</p>

                <p>Perceptual localization of brief, high-contrast perisaccadic visual probes is grossly erroneous. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory&ndash;motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, noncardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a saccade toward an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally imposed delay, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade toward the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization toward the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is the strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.</p>

Assessing someone’s level of consciousness is a complex matter, and attempts have been made to aid clinicians in these assessments through metrics based on neuroimaging data. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in altered states of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after <i>in silico</i> perturbations, using a simulated fMRI-based version of the Perturbational Complexity Index, a measure that has been shown to distinguish different levels of consciousness in <i>in vivo</i> settings. Crucially, we found that states of consciousness involving lower arousal and/or lower awareness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities, a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity compared to control subjects. We show that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

Many organisms, notably phototrophs, routinely acquire resources over only a fraction of the day. They have to balance their main period of initial biosynthesis against cell cycle events. Because of their short generation times, this challenge is especially acute for the planktonic microalgae that perform 50% of global C-fixation. Empirical evidence indicates that microalgal day-average growth is a function of the ability to acquire resources rapidly when available, retaining initial products of assimilation to support growth. A fundamental question arises over the optimal physiological configuration to support such activity. Here, we applied computer simulations implementing a development of the quota concept, in which the internal limiting resource is itself C, ratioed against total organism C-biomass. The model comprises metabolite and core pools of carbon C (<sup>M</sup><i>C</i> and <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>, respectively), with growth modulated by <sup>M</sup><i>C</i>/(<sup>M</sup><i>C</i><sup> </sup>+ <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>); <sup>M</sup><i>C</i> supports growth of <sup>C</sup><i>C</i> in the absence of concurrent resource acquisition. Dynamic feedback interactions from the relative size of <sup>M</sup>C controls resource acquisition. The model reproduces the general pattern of growth at different light:day fraction (<i>LD</i>), and of afternoon-depression of C-fixation. We explored the efficiency of the physiological cell configuration to locate optimal configurations at different combinations of maximum growth rates (<i>U</i><sub>max</sub>) and <i>LD</i> values across plausible parameter values for microalgae. While the optimum maximum resource acquisition rate deployed during the L phase scales with <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>LD</i>, the maximum size of the metabolite pool scales to <i>LD</i>/<i>DV</i>, where <i>DV</i> is division time (i.e. <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/Ln(2)). Accordingly, we conclude that faster growing organisms carry a penalty limiting their geographic spread to latitudes and seasons where <i>LD</i> is high. Larger, vacuolated organisms (such as diatoms), having a bigger metabolite compartment, may be at an advantage in such situations.

                <p>by Swathi Anil, Dan F. M. Goodman, Marcus Ghosh</p>

Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of pediatric “mild” traumatic brain injury (pmTBI), very little is known about the long-term effects of injury on brain structure and how injuries manifest in the context of dynamic and regionally specific neurodevelopmental changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective study design characterizing long-term effects of pmTBI on both global (brain age) and regional (hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and cortical thickness) brain structure at approximately 7 days, 4 months, and 1-year post-injury. A large sample of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was imaged at identical temporal intervals to account for typical neurodevelopmental changes, and to assess how trauma potentially affects developmental trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 269 pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 41.6% female) and 232 healthy controls (age = 14.1 ± 2.9; 44.8% female) were included in the final analyses (&gt;70% 1-year retention). Results demonstrated that the presence of loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia was associated with increased brain age up to 1-year post-injury, increased frontal cortical thickness at 4 months, as well as hippocampal atrophy across all time points relative to controls. “Mild” head trauma also interfered with hippocampal neurodevelopment in a dose-dependent fashion, including within the CA1 subfield. In contrast, post-concussive symptom burden was not associated with any structural abnormalities or alterations to neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Current findings suggest a dose-dependent relationship between injury severity and alterations in both global and regional brain structure within the spectrum of pmTBI. Our results emphasize the importance of using objective biomarkers rather than subjective self-reported symptoms to better understand the long-term effects of injury.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy filters and 2-fuzzy filters of a quasi-ordered residuated system K . This research explores comparative, normal, implicative and associative fuzzy filters within a quasi-ordered residuated system. It establishes the sufficient conditions under which a comparative fuzzy filter in K qualifies as a normal fuzzy filter and vice-versa. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the collection of all comparative fuzzy filters in K constitutes a complete lattice. The notion of fuzzy filters of a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated system is introduced and the analysis extends to fantastic, comparative, associative and implicative fuzzy filters within a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated framework. Finally, it is proven that an associative fuzzy filter in K inherently satisfies the criteria for both implicative and comparative fuzzy filters.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1.3% to 4% of paediatric appendectomies. It is the most common complication after an appendectomy. Surgical complications in paediatric patients increase patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections, falls and drug-related side effects The aim of this study was to identify the modifiable risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Methodology Paediatric patients who underwent appendectomies from April 2018 to April 2023 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in coastal Karnataka were included. Clinical characteristics of patients were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results A total of 459 paediatric patients underwent appendectomies between 2018 and 2023. 45 (9.8%) developed surgical site infections (SSIs). Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate) revealed significant associations (p < 0.05) between SSIs and the following categorical variables: faecal incontinence, surgical technique, wound type, type of appendicitis, postoperative stay and use of invasive devices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further identified laparotomy (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.31–14.74), presence of invasive devices (OR = 104.4, 95% CI: 5.45–2002.93), longer consultation-to-surgery time (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17–1.88), and increased surgery duration (OR = 1.02 per minute, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04) as independent risk factors significantly associated with the development of SSIs. Discussion The study identified laparotomy, use of drains, delayed surgery, and longer operation time as key risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Despite standard precautions, high SSI rates were observed, likely due to modifiable surgical factors and antimicrobial resistance. The findings highlight the need for optimized surgical practices, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary strategies to reduce SSI rates and improve patient outcomes.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897. Protocol version 4.2, Date 21.11.2019

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-563/v1?src=rss">Incidence And Predictors Of Phlebites In Neonates Admitted To Nicus In Northwest Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023:Multi Center Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction phlebitis is one of the complications associated with the placement of peripheral intravascular lines in neonates and serves as an indicator of the quality of care provided by health professionals. Determining its incidence and predictors provides valuable evidence for stakeholders to address this issue and the potential factors contributing to phlebitis. Objective This study aims to determine the incidence and predictors of phlebitis among neonates with perinatal asphyxia admitted at the neonatal intensive care unit of West Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Method A multicentered, institution-based prospective follow-up study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2024, at the Northwest Amhara Region Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was employed, and data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry of neonates. The collected data were entered into EPI-DATA V.4.6.0.0 and analyzed using STATA V.14. The Kaplan-Meier failure curve and log-rank test were utilized, and both bivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of phlebitis. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Result The overall incidence of phlebitis was 20.9 per 1,000 neonate-day observations (95% CI: 17.12-25.54) during the entire follow-up period. Of the 423 neonates admitted to the NICU, 96 (22.69%) (95% CI: 18.93-26.94) developed phlebitis. Significant predictors included birth asphyxia (AHR= 2.1; 95% CI: 1.38-3.19), trials of cannulation (AHR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.01-6.36), macrosomic neonates (AHR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.17-7.96), flushed cannulas (AHR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.97), and short dwelling time (AHR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.765). Conculsion The incidence rate of phlebitis was higher than that reported in other studies. Predictors of phlebitis included birth asphyxia, the number of cannulation trials, macrosomic neonates, flushed cannulas, and shorter dwelling times.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-562/v1?src=rss">The prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage and its related risk factors among preterm neonates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a serious concern for preterm infants and can predispose such infants to brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim The present study aimed to determine the frequency of IVH and its risk factors in the premature newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at King Fahd University Hospital. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 201 preterm neonates admitted at King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Saudi Arabia over a period of 7 years (from 2016 to 2023). These neonates were diagnosed by cranial ultrasound. IVH was classified into four grades based on Papile classification. The frequency of IVH was compared across various attributing factors i.e., gestational age at delivery, gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal antenatal steroids. Results Two hundred and one patients were analyzed (male 50.7% vs. female 49.3%). 51.2% had a gestational age of 29 weeks or less. More than half (54.2%) had a birth weight of ≤1200g. The incidence of IVH in a 7-year duration was 41.8%, with stage 1 (41.7%) and stage 2 (34.5%) being the most common IVH stages. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CHD, seizure, and ROP were identified as the significant independent predictors of IVH among preterm infants. Conclusion IVH in premature infants remains a complex and delicate issue in neonatology. An integrated approach covering both prevention and treatment is essential to minimize the negative impact of this complication on the neurological development of premature infants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v1?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Income gaps threaten democratic vitality, yet the evidence is mixed on whether economic inequality inevitably suppresses citizens’ political voices. We argue that institutional integrity—particularly the capacity to curb corruption—conditions how inequality translates into civic disengagement. By embedding governance quality in the inequality-participation debate, this study addresses a significant omission in comparative political-economy scholarship and offers policy-relevant insights. Methods We compile a balanced panel of ten democracies—Australia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—for 2002-2022. Voice and Accountability (Worldwide Governance Indicators) are the outcome variable; predictors include the lagged Gini Index, extreme poverty headcount, GDP-per-capita growth, and five governance metrics. Country- and year-fixed-effects regressions with cluster-robust errors are estimated. Diagnostic tests (Pesaran LM, IPS, Westerlund, VIF) guide specification and interaction terms to assess whether strong corruption control moderates inequality’s impact in developed versus developing subsamples. Results Corruption control is the strongest positive predictor of democratic voice, while inequality and poverty are insignificant in isolation. Interaction models reveal pronounced asymmetries. In developed economies, the deleterious effect of inequality is neutralised—and sometimes reversed—when corruption is tightly controlled (β = +0.028, p < 0.01). In developing economies, inequality remains benign until corruption escalates, at which point higher Gini scores significantly erode Voice and Accountability (β = -0.020, p ≈ 0.07). Corrected models confirm a modest universal adverse effect of inequality once institutional dynamics are constant. Conclusions Inequality is not destiny; its democratic toll depends on whether institutions can control corruption. Policy agendas that redistribute income will underperform if they neglect governance reforms. Combating graft, professionalising public administration, and expanding digital feedback channels can shield civic participation even in unequal societies. Conversely, failing to fortify institutions leaves democracies—especially developing ones—vulnerable to a corrosive feedback loop of widening gaps and falling political voices.

<p>The advances achieved against multiple sclerosis (MS) represent one of the great success stories of modern molecular medicine. The development of therapies with increasing selectivity and safety, guided by gains in understanding the fundamental immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and triggers of this disease, have broadened the traditional focus on treatment, adding realistic possibilities for prevention and repair. Here, we summarize recent advances that have together transformed the disease from the most common crippler of young adults in the western world to its place today as a condition in which most newly diagnosed patients can anticipate lives free from disability.

                Demenego et al. show that inborn errors of immunity (IEI) directly impact neurodevelopment independently of immune dysfunction. In WHIM syndrome, CXCR4 hyperactivation disrupts cerebellar assembly and behavior via cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Early brain-targeted CXCR4 antagonist rescues both structural and psychomotor defects. The study redefines the neurodevelopmental origins of IEI-associated symptoms.

                Memories do not reflect the continuous nature of experience—they represent distinct events. How does the brain know when one memory should end and the next should begin? Clewett et al. show that during meaningful changes, increased arousal and locus coeruleus activation trigger the formation of separate episodic memories.

This multivalent interaction forms dynamic condensates, facilitating efficient TTBK2 recruitment and initiating ciliogenesis, highlighting the critical role of phase separation in cilia formation.

                Burgmer et al. show that the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE repress key metabolic functions in the Drosophila midgut. These regulations occur independently of canonical immune pathways and restrict parasitic Wolbachia endosymbionts in the intestine and peripheral tissues. Thus, PRRs act beyond canonical immune pathways to control bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100292">Different roles of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens in pair bond formation of male mandarin voles</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in pair bond formation. However, the involvements of DA release, real-time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of ventral pallidum (VP) -projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced pair bond formation, while chemogenetic activation of VP-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell inhibited pair bond formation. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104074">Upstream open reading frames buffer translational variability during Drosophila evolution and development</a></h4>

              
                Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF translation efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two <i>Drosophila</i> species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the <i>bicoid</i> (<i>bcd</i>) gene—a prominent example of translational buffering—resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96675">Clearance of protein aggregates during cell division</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregates are spatially organized and regulated in cells to prevent the deleterious effects of proteostatic stress. Misfolding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed, especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid-like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminated at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). The ER reorganization that is active during mitosis and cytokinesis was required for the aggregate clearance. Thus, dividing cells reorganize the ER networks to allow BiP to clear the protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100376">A general mechanism for initiating the bacterial general stress response</a></h4>

              
                The General Stress Response promotes survival of bacteria in adverse conditions, but how sensor proteins transduce species-specific signals to initiate the response is not known. The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. This coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism additionally suggests a resolution to the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.

">NEUROLINGUA: A Neuroimaging Database Tailored to Unravel the Complexity of Multilingual Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying language processing involve a well-defined brain network, including mainly left perisylvian areas. Yet, the extent of its individual variability remains largely unexplored, particularly in bilingual and multilingual contexts. Differences in linguistic profiles (e.g., age of acquisition, exposure, proficiency) provide an opportunity to assess how network topology adapts to sociolinguistic factors. To address this, we developed NEUROLINGUA, a comprehensive database of functional and structural MRI data, enriched with sociodemographic, sociolinguistic, and behavioral information. It includes 725 healthy individuals aged 18-82 immersed in a Basque-Spanish multilingual environment, ranging from near-monolinguals to highly proficient multilinguals. Participants completed a functional MRI language localizer with both auditory and visual comprehension tasks, enabling cross-modal comparisons. Additionally, this localizer included sentences involving arithmetic problem-solving. Exploratory analyses confirmed associations between structural MRI, sociodemographic, and cognitive measures. Functional MRI validated NEUROLINGUA's capacity to localize the language comprehension network and capture linguistic profile effects. This integrative dataset offers an unparalleled resource to investigate the factors influencing language network adaptability and variability in diverse sociolinguistic contexts.

">Multidimensional components of impulsivity during early adolescence: Relationships with brain networks and future substance-use in the Adolescent Brian and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study</a></h4>

              
                Impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that typically increases during adolescence and is implicated in risk for substance use disorders that develop later in life. Here, we take a multivariate approach to identify latent dimensions of impulsivity, broadly defined, among youth enrolled in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and explore associations with individual differences in demographics, substance-use initiation and canonical resting state networks (N=11,872, ages ~9-10). Using principal component analysis, we identified eight latent impulsivity dimensions, the top three of which together accounted for the majority of the variance across all impulsivity assessments. The first principal component (PC1) was a general impulsivity factor that mapped onto all impulsivity-related assessments. PC2 mapped onto a 'mixed' impulsivity style related to both poorer, less attentive performance on the SST and decreased delay discounting. PC3 linked externalizing behaviors across multiple measures with indices of delay discounting, making delay discounting the only impulsivity-related assessment to load on all three of the top PCs. Multiple impulsivity PCs were significantly associated with subsequent initiation of alcohol and cannabis use. Finally, we found both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the PCs and functional connectivity between and within frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, and default mode networks. These data provide a critical empirical baseline for how facets of impulsivity covary in early adolescence which may be tracked through future waves of ABCD data, enabling longitudinal elucidation of how dimensions of impulsivity interact with other individual and environmental factors to influence risk for substance use later in life.

">Central nervous system atlas of larval zebrafish constructed using the morphology of single excitatory and inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive single-neuron mapping is essential for understanding the brain connectome. However, focusing only on mapping the projections of neurons from a single brain region gives limited insight into the global organizational principles of brain connectivity. Here, we present a whole body-wide Common Physical Space (CPSv1.0) for larval zebrafish, integrating neuroanatomical parcellations, cytoarchitecture atlases of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, and a dendrite-axon-annotated projectome comprising 12,219 E and 7,792 I neuronal morphologies (~25% of total E and I neurons). These neurons span all regions of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia, forming 531 hierarchical morphotypes and generating weighted and directed inter-cell-type and inter-region connectomes. Projection and network analyses reveal structural divergence between E and I neurons, combinatory and modular projection rules, behavior-linked pathways, structured E and I connectivities, and multimodal sensorimotor hubs. Hosted on an open interactive platform, these digital atlases establish a scalable framework for multimodal neural data integration, offering insights into the global neural architecture across the whole central nervous system.

">Gene therapies alleviate absence epilepsy associated with Scn2a deficiency in DBA/2J mice</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A, which encodes the NaV1.2 channel, cause severe epileptic seizures. Patients with SCN2A loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, such as protein-truncating mutations, often experience later-onset and drug-resistant epilepsy, highlighting an urgent unmet clinical need for new therapies. We previously developed a gene-trap Scn2a (Scn2agt/gt) mouse model with a global NaV1.2 reduction in the widely used C57BL/6N (B6) strain. Although these mice display multiple behavioral abnormalities, EEG recordings indicated only mild epileptiform discharges, possibly attributable to the seizure-resistant characteristics associated with the B6 strain. To enhance the epileptic phenotype, we derived congenic Scn2agt/gt mice in the seizure-susceptible DBA/2J (D2J) strain. Notably, we found that these mice exhibit prominent spontaneous absence seizures, marked by both short and long spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Restoring NaV1.2 expression in adult mice substantially reduced their SWDs, suggesting the possibility of SCN2A gene replacement therapy during adulthood. RNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in gene expression in the Scn2agt/gt mice, in particular a broad downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) genes, including KV1.1. The reduction of KV1.1 expression was further validated in human cerebral organoids with SCN2A deficiency, highlighting KV1.1 as a promising therapeutic target for refractory seizures associated with SCN2A dysfunction. Importantly, delivery of exogenous human KV1.1 expression via adeno-associated virus (AAV) in D2J Scn2agt/gt mice substantially reduced absence seizures. Together, these findings underscore the influence of mouse strain on seizure severity and highlight the potential of targeted gene therapies for treating SCN2A deficiency-related epilepsies.

">Intermingled representation of oral cavity in mouse trigeminal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Somatotopy serves as a fundamental principle underlying sensory information processing, traditionally emphasized in the study of the cerebral cortex. However, little effort has been directed towards unraveling the spatial organization characterizing the earlier stages of somatosensory pathways. In this study, we developed a novel methodology to visualize individual neurons within the trigeminal ganglion, a crucial cluster of cell bodies of sensory neurons innervating the face. Our investigations revealed a reliable sensory response to stimulation of the lower incisor or lip within this ganglion. The responsive neurons were confined to a specific portion of the trigeminal ganglion, consistent with innervation of the lower oral cavity by the mandibular nerve (V3). Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe a discernible map differentiating the lower tooth and the lip. Instead, the spatial representation of the tooth and lip within this portion of trigeminal ganglion exhibited intermingling with no clear border between tooth-responding and lip-responding neurons. These findings contrast with earlier studies that identified tooth and lip responding regions in the somatosensory cortex. Our study sheds light on the complex spatial organization of sensory processing in the trigeminal system, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and implications for sensory perception and clinical interventions.

">Implantable CMOS Deep-Brain Fluorescence Imager with Single-Neuron Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Despite the advantages of optical imaging over electrophysiology, such as cell-type specificity, its application has been limited to the investigation of shallow brain regions (< 2 mm) because of the light scattering property of brain tissue. Passive optical conduits such as graded-index lenses and waveguides have permitted access to deeper locales but with restricted resolution and field of view, while creating massive lesions along the inserted path, with little pathway to improvement in the technology. As an alternative, we present the Acus device, an active implantable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) neural imager with a 512-pixel silicon image sensor post-processed into a 4.1-mm-long, 120-m-wide shank with a collinear fiber for illumination, which is able to record transient fluorescent signals in deep brain regions at 400 frames/sec. Acus can achieve single-neuron resolution in functional imaging of GCaMP6s-expressing neurons at a frame rate of 400 frames/sec.

Calcium imaging confirmed a functional expression of GluN2D in nonpyramidal neurons. DQP treatment enhanced apical dendritic branching and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and spine density, suggesting a disinhibitory effect mirrored by a reduced expression of GAD-65, VGAT, and Syt-2. Control basket cells had larger axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs), and under CIQ, the AcDs grew even larger. The axons of CIQ-treated basket cells formed more branches within the dendritic field, and the effect was strongest for axons emerging from AcDs. DQP-treated basket cells also displayed more complex AcDs, presumably driven by enhanced network activity. However, local branching of basket cell axons was reduced under DQP in somatic axon cells but at control level in AcD cells. This suggested a growth-promoting effect of the enhanced network activity and that the AcD configuration neutralized the inhibitory action of DQP on basket cell axons. The results suggest a specific role of GluN2D signaling for development and remodeling of interneuronal axons.</span>

Thus, we examined reconfiguration between rest and passive viewing of a mockumentary television show, involving richly contextualized social interactions, among young (18 to 35 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 101) and older (61 to 92 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 83) adults. Then, we related reconfiguration to participants’ accurate understanding of those social interactions (theory of mind) on a novel task conducted outside of the scanner. Consistent with prior work, older adults exhibited greater cortical reconfiguration and worse theory-of-mind performance compared to young adults. Greater reconfiguration related to worse theory-of-mind performance, and the default and frontoparietal networks most strongly contributed to this association. These findings provide greater insight into how reduced neural specializations with age disrupt social cognition even in the absence of an explicit task.</span>

While genetic factors significantly influence both schizophrenia and cerebral ventricular enlargement, the shared genetic etiology between them requires further investigation. Using summary statistics from recent large genome-wide association studies on schizophrenia and 9 ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes. Gaussian causal mixture modeling was applied to characterize the genetic architecture and overlap between schizophrenia and ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes. Local genetic correlation was investigated with Local Analysis of Variant Association. The conjunctional false discovery rate framework was used to identify the specific shared genetic loci, annotated with FUMA. Gaussian causal mixture modeling estimated schizophrenia to be more polygenic more polygenic (9574 trait-influencing variants) than ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes (157–1267 trait-influencing variants). Conjunctional false discovery rate analysis identified 42 shared genetic loci, 17 loci were identified as novel for both schizophrenia and the ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes. Local Analysis of Variant Association revealed that 11 distinct loci demonstrated significant differences, among which 4 loci were situated in the Major Histocompatibility Complex region. Annotated genes in shared loci were enriched in molecular signaling pathways involved in inflammation and the brain structure. The shared loci between them were annotated and enriched in Major Histocompatibility Complex and inflammation-related pathways, highlighting new opportunities for future investigation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by structural and functional brain differences relative to typically developing individuals. Although previous work has identified abnormalities in rich-club (RC) organization and left–right asymmetry in ASD, the developmental trajectory of these anomalies remains unclear. In this study, we examined how age influences structure–function coupling and structural proportions in RC networks using data from 140 participants (aged 5-26 years) drawn from ABIDE II. Our findings revealed significant, age-related differences in the left hemisphere of ASD participants compared to controls, with the RC network predominantly localized in this region. Furthermore, an interaction effect in local RC organization—though not in global RC or feeder connections—was observed between diagnostic groups and brain lateralization. Notably, rightward lateralization in local RC networks increased with age in ASD individuals, whereas it decreased with age in controls. These results underscore an atypical, age-dependent pattern of hemispheric asymmetry in ASD and offer new insights into abnormal neurodevelopmental trajectories within RC organization.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A mental set is a cognitive bias that results from repeatedly applying a stereotypical problem-solving strategy, which can hinder new and creative ideas. However, the neural mechanisms underlying mental set induction remain unclear. We hypothesized that repeated use of a strategy increases neural representation similarity, thus producing a mental set. To test this, we conducted representational similarity analysis across continuously presented mindset-induction trials using the same loose chunk decomposition problem-solving strategy. This induction was expected to impair the solving of subsequent probe trials requiring a more insightful tight chunk decomposition strategy. Results showed that neural representational similarity increased across loose chunk decomposition induction stages, particularly in regions related to cognitive control, mental operations, and the default mode network. These increases predicted activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal lobe during tight chunk decomposition trials. Furthermore, the medial frontal lobe moderated the impact of increased similarity during mental set induction, affecting representational changes from loose chunk decomposition to tight chunk decomposition in perceptual, operative, and executive processing regions. In summary, our findings suggest that increased neural representational similarity in goal-directed mental manipulation networks and the default mode network supports mental set induction, enhancing conflict resolution and representational change during creative problem-solving with different strategies.</span>

We found that specialization for numerical and geometric processing in parietal cortex exists by 4–8 years of age, and that children exhibited greater conjunctive activation between numerical and geometric tasks throughout the parietal cortex compared to adults. During the number line task, children’s neural activity significantly overlapped with activity from both number and geometric shape matching tasks, whereas adults’ activity only overlapped with the number task.

Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when participants performed an adapted social judgment paradigm with three stages: social feedback expectation, social feedback evaluation, and expectation updating. Behavioral analysis revealed higher acceptance expectation and lower rejection expectation in the shared positive experience (SPE) condition than in the shared negative experience (SNE) condition; receiving acceptance feedback increased acceptance expectation in the subsequent trial. EEG results revealed that at the social feedback expectation stage, rejection evoked a larger stimulus-preceding negativity magnitude than acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. At the social feedback evaluation stage, rejection feedback evoked a smaller early frontal theta than acceptance feedback in the SNE but not SPE condition; unexpected acceptance evoked a larger P300 than unexpected rejection in the SPE but not SNE condition. At the expectation updating stage, unexpected acceptance elicited larger late posterior theta than expected acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. These results suggest that shared positive experiences reduce vigilance toward impending rejection and increase sensitivity to pleasantness, whereas shared negative experiences blunt reactivity to rejection feedback and foster social learning from unexpected acceptance to enhance positive expectation.</span>

                The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally, especially in lower-middle-income countries, underscoring the need for effective public health interventions. There is limited evidence that mobile health interventions can assist in identifying the risk of NCDs in the community. Leveraging existing grassroots infrastructure, such as the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program, presents a promising opportunity to address this challenge. We developed a mHealth application to address this issue. This study protocol describes the design of a pilot study aimed at developing a mHealth application, assessing the feasibility, acceptability (barriers and facilitators), and usability to triage the risk of NCDs and pilot test it in the hands of the LHWs in Pakistan. This study consists of three phases. In phase 1, we develop a comprehensive mHealth application incorporating validated tools for NCD assessment, including the Rose Angina Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status, Risk Assessment of Pakistani Individuals for Diabetes, Global Adult Tobacco Survey, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Refined Food Frequency Questionnaire, and WHO 5 Wellness Index. Phase 2 involves qualitative focus group discussions with LHWs to refine the prototype. Phase 3 entails piloting the application with a sample of 30 LHWs in Karachi and Hyderabad, followed by qualitative exit feedback from LHWs, supervisors, healthcare providers, and community members. The outcomes will be analyzed by means, standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous data based on the normality assumption. The frequency with percentages will be registered for the categorical variables to describe the risk identifiers using the NCD tool kit. Internal consistency as validity evidence of the assessment can be determined using Cronbach’s alpha and the content validation index. If deemed feasible or acceptable, our mHealth app will address gaps in the literature and advance NCD research by identifying and improving the quality of life of people in the community in developing countries like Pakistan. The functioning and dissemination of this MHealth application can be an essential step towards highly scalable NCD data collection for a population at high risk for developing NCDs.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years, Sample range 120-3,705. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%, I2 = 99.96), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%, I2 = 99.96) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%, I2 = 99.61). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, where rice is a critical staple food, as in many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could trigger social unrest during shortages. Price control approaches are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as boosting rice stocks through imports to quickly influence market prices. Indirect controls consist of longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity for gradual stabilization. This study proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal rice import volume to minimize bi-monthly retail price fluctuations. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with seven explanatory variables: the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, GDP per capita, the price of ground dry rice (GKG) per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice distribution, and government-managed rice stock aimed at ensuring domestic availability and price stability. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum price change rates maintained between 0.75% and 1.14% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.20% to 0.34%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

We present a protein engineering approach to directed evolution with machine learning that integrates a new semi-supervised neural network fitness prediction model, Seq2Fitness, and an innovative optimization algorithm, biphasic annealing for diverse and adaptive sequence sampling (BADASS) to design sequences. Seq2Fitness leverages protein language models to predict fitness landscapes, combining evolutionary data with experimental labels, while BADASS efficiently explores these landscapes by dynamically adjusting temperature and mutation energies to prevent premature convergence and to generate diverse high-fitness sequences. Compared to alternative models, Seq2Fitness improves Spearman correlation with experimental fitness measurements, increasing from 0.34 to 0.55 on sequences containing mutations at positions entirely not seen during training. BADASS requires less memory and computation compared to gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, while generating more high-fitness and diverse sequences across two protein families. For both families, 100% of the top 10,000 sequences identified by BADASS exceed the wildtype in predicted fitness, whereas competing methods range from 3% to 99%, often producing far fewer than 10,000 sequences. BADASS also finds higher-fitness sequences at every cutoff (top 1, 100, and 10,000). Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework explaining BADASS’s underlying mechanism and behavior. While we focus on amino acid sequences, BADASS may generalize to other sequence spaces, such as DNA and RNA.

Neuronal regeneration in the adult brain, which is restricted compared to that in the embryonic brain, is a long-standing topic in neuroscience and medical research. Based on studies in mammals, a small number of newly generated immature neurons (neuroblasts) migrate toward damaged sites and contribute to functional recovery. During migration, neuroblasts form chain-like collectives and modify the morphology of glial cells (astrocytes), which are the main components of the surrounding environment. However, it remains unclear how neuroblasts form collectives and how efficient migration is achieved through collective formation in a pool of astrocytes. The main difficulty lies in tracking individual neuroblasts within the collective, both in vitro and in vivo, over a period. To address this impasse, we built a mathematical model of the neuroblast-astrocyte system to assess its long-term performance in silico. Our simulations showed that individual neuroblasts gathered into chain-like collectives through occasional contact, astrocyte confinement, and moderate adhesion between the neuroblasts. The forward movement of neuroblasts in an astrocyte-dense environment was accelerated if we assumed a simple interaction: the higher the number of neuroblasts near an astrocyte, the stronger the shrinkage of astrocytic protrusions. Furthermore, temporal changes in neuroblast behavior, as indicated by our observation of living neuroblasts in culture, reinforce the advantages of simulated collectives. A collective of neuroblasts with constant behavior sometimes repeated non-migratory movements, whereas those with inconstant behavior were easily untangled, resulting in a rapid migration. These results highlight the potential for neuroblast collectivity and inconstancy in enhancing neuronal regeneration in the adult brain.

                <p>by Takuya Kawamura, Megumi Shigematsu, Yohei Kirino</p>

tRNA halves are among the most abundant short non-coding RNAs in the cellular transcriptome. Here we report that in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the hormone-dependent 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half promoted cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression. Global mRNA profiling upon the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half depletion revealed that the mRNA of p21, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, is post-transcriptionally destabilized via a 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half-driven mechanism. YBX1, identified as a protein interacting with 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half in the cytosol, was shown to stabilize p21 mRNA. Specific sequences resembling the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half, located in the 3′-UTR of p21 mRNA and termed LL588, were identified as the binding site for YBX1 and are required for p21 mRNA stability. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half is capable of displacing YBX1 from LL588. Collectively, our findings suggest that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half directly binds to and displaces YBX1 from p21 mRNA, leading to the destabilization of p21 mRNA and the promotion of cell cycle progression in hormone-dependent cancers. Our study illuminates the role of tRNA halves in regulating mRNA stability and suggests that this may be part of broader regulatory networks affecting mRNA levels, orchestrated by various tRNA halves and their interacting proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003186">Embodiment of an artificial limb in mice</a></h4>

Body ownership disorders can be triggered by disease or body damage. Methods to probe limb embodiment are required to address those disorders. This includes the development of neuroprostheses that better integrate into the body scheme of the user. To this end, the “rubber hand illusion” protocol is a key behavioral method to probe the powerful embodiment that can be triggered by congruent somatosensory and visual inputs from the limb. So far, the neurophysiology of limb embodiment remains poorly known, in part because translating the rubber hand illusion to animal models such as the mouse remains challenging. Yet, mapping out the brain circuits of embodiment thanks to the use of genetic and optogenetic research tools would allow to propose novel embodiment restoration strategies. Here, we show that the rubber hand illusion described in humans can be translated to the mouse forelimb model using an automated, videography-based procedure. We exposed head-fixed mice to a visible, static 3D-printed replica of the right forelimb, while their own forelimb was hidden from their sight. We synchronously brushed their hidden forelimb and the replica. Following these visuo-tactile associations, the replica was visually threatened, and we probed the reaction of the mice using automated tracking of pupils and facial expression. The mice focused significantly more of their gaze toward the threatened forelimb replica after receiving synchronous tactile and visual information compared to asynchronous. More generally, across test and control conditions, the mouse pupillary response was consistent with the human overt response to the rubber hand illusion. Thus, our results show that mice exhibit quantifiable behavioral markers of the embodiment of an artificial forelimb.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003180">Sensory stimuli dominate over rhythmic electrical stimulation in modulating behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuranny Cabral-Calderin, Molly J. Henry</p>

Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, <i>N</i> = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, <i>N</i> = 24; Experiment 3, <i>N</i> = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 17 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individual’s preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

                <p>by Sam Hall-McMaster, Momchil S. Tomov, Samuel J. Gershman, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Generalization from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, one efficient computational approach is to evaluate solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (<i>n</i> = 38) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and generalized them to novel test tasks in a reward-selective manner. This behavior was consistent with a computational process based on the successor representation known as successor features and generalized policy improvement (SF&GPI). Neither model-free perseveration or model-based control using a complete model of the environment could explain choice behavior. Decoding from functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that solutions from the SF&GPI algorithm were activated on test tasks in visual and prefrontal cortex. This activation had a functional connection to behavior in that stronger activation of SF&GPI solutions in visual areas was associated with increased behavioral reuse. These findings point to a possible neural implementation of an adaptive algorithm for generalization across tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.
