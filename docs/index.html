                arXiv:2510.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theta rhythm is important for many cognitive functions including spatial processing, memory encoding, and memory recall. The information processing underlying these functions is thought to rely on consistent, phase-specific spiking throughout a theta oscillation that may fluctuate significantly in baseline (center of oscillations), frequency, or amplitude. Experimental evidence shows that spikes can occur at specific phases even when the baseline membrane potential varies significantly, such that the integrity of phase-locking persists across a large variability in spike threshold. The mechanism of this precise spike timing during the theta rhythm is not yet known and previous mathematical models have not reflected the large variability in threshold potential seen experimentally. Here we introduce a straightforward mathematical neural model capable of demonstrating a phase-locked spiking in the face of significant baseline membrane potential fluctuation during theta rhythm. This novel approach incorporates a degenerate grazing bifurcation of an asymptotically stable oscillation. This model suggests a potential mechanism for how biological neurons can consistently produce spikes near the peak of a variable membrane potential oscillation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13688">Jacobian-Based Interpretation of Nonlinear Neural Encoding Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the alignment between artificial neural network (ANN) embeddings and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) via neural encoding models has significantly advanced research on neural representation mechanisms and interpretability in the brain. However, these approaches remain limited in characterizing the brain's inherently nonlinear response properties. To address this, we propose the Jacobian-based Nonlinearity Evaluation (JNE), an interpretability metric for nonlinear neural encoding models. JNE quantifies nonlinearity by statistically measuring the dispersion of local linear mappings (Jacobians) from model representations to predicted BOLD responses, thereby approximating the nonlinearity of BOLD signals. Centered on proposing JNE as a novel interpretability metric, we validated its effectiveness through controlled simulation experiments on various activation functions and network architectures, and further verified it on real fMRI data, demonstrating a hierarchical progression of nonlinear characteristics from primary to higher-order visual cortices, consistent with established cortical organization. We further extended JNE with Sample-Specificity (JNE-SS), revealing stimulus-selective nonlinear response patterns in functionally specialized brain regions. As the first interpretability metric for quantifying nonlinear responses, JNE provides new insights into brain information processing. Code available at https://github.com/Gaitxh/JNE.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13519">Data-Driven Reduced Modeling of Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience to model the collective activity of neurons during behavioral tasks. The high dimensionality of their parameter and activity spaces, however, often make it challenging to infer and interpret the fundamental features of their dynamics.
  In this study, we employ recent nonlinear dynamical system techniques to uncover the core dynamics of several RNNs used in contemporary neuroscience. Specifically, using a data-driven approach, we identify Spectral Submanifolds (SSMs), i.e., low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds tangent to the eigenspaces of fixed points. The internal dynamics of SSMs serve as nonlinear models that reduce the dimensionality of the full RNNs by orders of magnitude.
  Through low-dimensional, SSM-reduced models, we give mathematically precise definitions of line and ring attractors, which are intuitive concepts commonly used to explain decision-making and working memory. The new level of understanding of RNNs obtained from SSM reduction enables the interpretation of mathematically well-defined and robust structures in neuronal dynamics, leading to novel predictions about the neural computations underlying behavior.

                arXiv:2510.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/MedARC-AI/fmri-fm.

                arXiv:2507.19944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perceptual estimates exhibit a reversal in bias depending on uncertainty: they shift toward prior expectations under high stimulus noise, but away from them when sensory noise dominates. The normative framework of a Bayesian observer model can account for this phenomenon, yet most formulations treat it as given rather than explaining its emergence through learning. We introduce a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that acquires latent representations and inference strategies directly from sensory inputs, without hand-crafted likelihoods or priors. Trained using adversarial learning with reconstruction on Gabor stimuli under varying uncertainty, the network learns to recover underlying stimuli from noisy inputs, and spontaneously reproduces the bias reversal observed in human perception. This emergent behavior arises from network responses that reveal signatures of efficient coding and Bayesian inference. Our findings provide an end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951">Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.

                arXiv:2505.12204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08436">Spike-frequency and h-current based adaptation are dynamically equivalent in a Wilson-Cowan field model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.08436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300">The Algorithmic Regulator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13400">From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories, employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of 'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition, which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining existence of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks for edge computing. Neuromorphic computing can significantly reduce energy requirements. Here, we present a complete pipeline: efficient event-based training of SNNs with synaptic delays on GPUs and deployment on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and Loihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster and uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

                arXiv:2510.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture.

                arXiv:2510.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain. To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at https://github.com/LilTiger/HFTP.

                arXiv:2510.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.

                arXiv:2509.24852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay. While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently emerged. Here, we introduce ``DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We show that SNNs with trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one), and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous) synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec, paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with programmable delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexmaxad/DelRec.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00194">Improving Planning with Large Language Models: A Modular Agentic Architecture</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.00194v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. Both cognitive neuroscience and reinforcement learning (RL) have proposed a number of interacting functional components that together implement search and evaluation in multi-step decision making. These components include conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and orchestration. To improve planning with LLMs, we propose an agentic architecture, the Modular Agentic Planner (MAP), in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of the specialized modules mentioned above, each implemented using an LLM. MAP improves planning through the interaction of specialized modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate MAP on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and the PlanBench benchmark -- as well as an NLP task requiring multi-step reasoning (strategyQA). We find that MAP yields significant improvements over both standard LLM methods (zero-shot prompting, in-context learning) and competitive baselines (chain-of-thought, multi-agent debate, and tree-of-thought), can be effectively combined with smaller and more cost-efficient LLMs (Llama3-70B), and displays superior transfer across tasks. These results suggest the benefit of a modular and multi-agent approach to planning with LLMs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269">Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>

                <p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<SUB>1</SUB> cannabinoid receptors (CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<SUB>1</SUB>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<SUB>1</SUB>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<SUB>1</SUB>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<SUB>1</SUB>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>

                <p>Vocal communication is a complex social behavior that entails the integration of auditory perception and vocal production. Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance "phee" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>

                <p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<I>Rattus norvegicus</I>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<I>Mus musculus</I>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>

                <p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>

                <p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>

                <p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>

                <p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>

                <p>Neonatal injury alters synaptic transmission in the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH), resulting in aberrant amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission. Astrocytes orchestrate synapse development and function across the CNS and play a critical role in the emergence and maintenance of persistent pain. However, little is currently known about the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes, nor about how the maturation of SDH astrocytes is impacted by early life injury. Here, we used a hindpaw incision model of postsurgical pain in postnatal day (P) 3 mice of both sexes to elucidate the effects of neonatal injury on the maturation of SDH astrocytes. Three-dimensional morphological analysis of individual astrocytes revealed that incision elicits age-dependent changes to astrocyte structure. At P4, spinal astrocytes in incised mice show increased size and complexity compared with naive controls. This is reversed at P10 and P24, as astrocytes from incised mice are smaller and less ramified compared with their naive counterparts. Transcriptomic analysis of spinal astrocytes revealed acute changes to gene expression after neonatal injury, as 76 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at P4 (such as <I>Thbs1</I>, <I>Efemp1</I>, <I>Acta1</I>, <I>Acta2</I>, <I>Tpm2</I>, and <I>Fgf14</I>), which included genes related to cell motility and cytoskeletal organization, but very few DEGs were detected at P10 and P24. Lastly, we identified that microglial engulfment of astrocyte material occurs in the developing dorsal horn and this process is altered by neonatal incision in a sex-dependent manner. These data illustrate, for the first time, that neonatal injury alters the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes.</p>

                <p>Although phasic alertness generally benefits cognitive performance, it often increases the impact of distracting information, resulting in impaired decision-making and cognitive control. However, it is unclear why phasic alertness has these negative effects. Here, we present a novel, biologically informed account, according to which phasic alertness generates a transient, evidence-independent input (TEI) to the decision process. This shortens overall response times but also amplifies competition between evidence accumulators, thus slowing down decision-making and impairing cognitive control. The key hypotheses of this account are supported with pupil measurements and electrophysiological data from human decision-makers of either sex performing an arrow flanker task. We also show that a computational model of the flanker task that incorporates a TEI can reproduce the behavioral effects of phasic alertness but only when the evidence accumulators compete with each other through lateral inhibition. Our results reveal a close interplay between dynamic changes in alertness, cognitive control, and evidence accumulation.</p>

                <p>Learning to detect and recognize a broad range of visual objects is a crucial developmental task during the first year of life. However, many of the neurophysiological changes underlying the emergence of this cognitive ability remain poorly understood. The current study tested the hypothesis that training infants to recognize novel objects leads to selectively enhanced visuocortical responses and a competitive advantage that prioritizes the processing of trained relative to untrained objects. A cross-sectional sample of parent&ndash;infant dyads at 6, 9, and 12&nbsp;months of age read books in which novel objects were associated with different types of labels. The next day, EEG was recorded while infants (<I>N</I> = 51, 24 females and 26 males, 1 unknown) were concurrently presented with trained objects (i.e., from the book) and untrained objects (i.e., novel objects not in the book). Trained and untrained objects flickered at distinct frequencies (5&nbsp;Hz, 6&nbsp;Hz) to evoke frequency-tagged steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). Analyses of the visuocortical response showed training-related competition effects that increased with age. Specifically, responses to trained stimuli increased while responses to untrained stimuli decreased with age. At 6&nbsp;months, infants showed no visuocortical bias for trained objects, but by 9 and 12&nbsp;months, visuocortical responses favored trained objects. This pattern suggests that competitive neural interactions between trained and untrained stimuli may support the development of object recognition and that experience with objects guides attentional prioritization in the infant brain.</p>

                <p>Despite the functional specialization in visual cortex, there is growing evidence that the processing of chromatic and spatial visual features is intertwined. While past studies focused on visual field biases in retina and behavior, large-scale dependencies between coding of color and retinotopic space are largely unexplored in the cortex. Using a sample of male and female volunteers, we asked whether spatial color biases are shared across different human observers and whether they are idiosyncratic for distinct areas. We tested this by predicting the color a person was seeing using a linear classifier that has never been trained on chromatic responses from that same brain, solely by taking into account: (1) the chromatic responses in other individuals&rsquo; brains and (2) commonalities between the spatial coding in brains used for training and the test brain. We were able to predict the color (and luminance) of stimuli seen by an observer based on other subjects&rsquo; activity patterns in areas V1&ndash;V3, hV4, and LO1. In addition, we found that different colors elicited systematic, large-scale retinotopic biases that were idiosyncratic for distinct areas and common across brains. The area-specific spatial color codes and their conservation across individuals suggest functional or evolutionary organization pressures that remain to be elucidated.</p>

                <p>The association between brain structural connectivity (BSC) and different subtypes of stroke has not been reported. The current study determined whether some BSC patterns may contribute to the risk of stroke. A two-sample, bidirectional, multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed. Genome-wide association summary statistics for BSC were obtained from the GWAS Catalog at the European Bioinformatics Institute, while stroke outcome data were obtained from the FinnGen study for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and from the MEGASTROKE Consortium for ischemic stroke (IS) and its subtypes. A colocalization analysis was performed to determine whether the association between BSC and stroke was driven by loci within genomic regions. Reverse MR was performed to evaluate potential stroke-induced changes in BSC. Among the significant findings, left hemisphere (LH) somatomotor network-to-LH salience/ventral attention network white matter (WM) structural connectivity (SC) [OR = 1.30; <I>p</I> = 5.96 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;4</sup>; <I>p</I> value after Bonferroni&rsquo;s correction [<I>p.bfr</I>] = 0.0125] and right hemisphere (RH) dorsal attention network (DAN)-to-thalamus WM-SC (OR = 1.23; <I>p</I> = 1.60 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.0125) were shown to have a positive association with the risk of IS. RH DAN-to-amygdala WM-SC (OR = 0.78; <I>p</I> = 1.26 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.0125) showed a negative relationship with the risk of IS. A high LH somatomotor network-to-RH visual network WM-SC (OR = 1.62; <I>p</I> = 9.10 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.025) was associated with an increased risk of large atherosclerotic stroke. In conclusion, the results of the current study provided some evidence from the perspective of genetics that different BSCs may have close associations with ICH, IS, and stroke subtypes. These findings may facilitate the screening and the risk stratification for stroke patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/10/ENEURO.0431-24.2025?rss=1">Prestimulus Periodic and Aperiodic Neural Activity Shapes McGurk Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies emphasize the importance of prestimulus neural oscillations in shaping endogenous brain states that substantially impact perceptual outcomes. However, what features in such oscillations drive perception remains unknown. Furthermore, research has shown that non-oscillatory activity is also important for cognitive processing. However, their interaction prior to perceiving a multisensory stimulus remains unexplored. In this human EEG study (<I>n</I> = 18, 10 males and 8 females), we investigated the role of prestimulus periodic power and aperiodic activity in modulating perception of the widely studied McGurk illusion on a trial-by-trial basis. Using logistic mixed-effects models, we reveal that the illusion perception is associated with reduced prestimulus alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) and beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power over frontal and occipital regions; increased theta (4&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz) power in parietal, central, and occipital regions; and increased gamma (31&ndash;45&nbsp;Hz) power across the scalp. Furthermore, lower aperiodic offset and exponent values in central, parietal, and occipital regions also predicted illusory responses. Our logistic mixed interaction models revealed that the aperiodic exponent and periodic power jointly influence the perception of upcoming McGurk stimuli. Specifically, a decrease in occipital theta and global beta power and an increase in occipital and parietal gamma power were associated with a steeper slope. We conclude that the predominant source of variations in the prestimulus state is the aperiodic activity and that fluctuations in both periodic and aperiodic activity account for inter-trial variability in the perception of the McGurk illusion.</p>

                Background Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by tumors in the parathyroid, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary. This study discusses two distinct clinical cases to illustrate the diverse manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for MEN 1. Methods A case-based approach was employed to examine the clinical presentation, biochemical findings, imaging results, and therapeutic interventions in two patients with MEN 1. Relevant literature was reviewed to contextualize the findings. Results Case 1 involved a 47-year-old female presenting with hyperparathyroidism and a gastrinoma, managed conservatively due to comorbid chronic kidney disease. Case 2 featured a 26-year-old female with aggressive manifestations, including severe osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic tail lesion, necessitating prompt surgical intervention. Both cases highlighted the utility of advanced imaging (Tc99 MIBI scans, MRI) and biochemical markers (serum calcium, iPTH, chromogranin A) in diagnosis and management. Genetic testing was emphasized as a key component of family screening and long-term surveillance. Discussion MEN 1 requires a multidisciplinary approach due to its multisystemic nature. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions, including parathyroidectomy and medical therapies like cinacalcet and somatostatin analogs, are critical to optimizing outcomes. The variability in clinical presentations underscores the need for personalized management plans. Conclusion The diverse spectrum of MEN 1 demands vigilant surveillance and a collaborative healthcare approach. Advances in diagnostics and targeted treatments continue to improve patient outcomes, but long-term management and genetic counseling remain pivotal.

                Obesity remains a global health problem, and bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, postoperative complications such as anastomotic stenosis or inflammation of the anastomosis can occur. This report describes a case of early anastomositis on the first postoperative day after a one-anastomosis gastric bypass in a 38-year-old patient with morbid obesity and metabolic comorbidities. Conservative management, including hormonal, antibacterial, and supportive therapy, led to resolution of symptoms without the need for endoscopic balloon dilation or revision surgery. Follow-up showed complete recovery with no dysphagia or reflux, and weight loss was achieved by the third postoperative month. This case demonstrates the potential effectiveness of non-surgical therapy in managing early postoperative anastomositis.

                Obesity and metabolic syndrome remain major global health challenges, with bariatric surgery being the most effective treatment in cases of severe obesity. Despite satisfactory outcomes, conventional one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is often complicated by weight regain, gastroesophageal reflux, and dumping syndrome. To address these issues, we developed a modified approach—FundoRing OAGB—which employs the patient’s own gastric fundus to create an autologous restrictive wrap, thereby enhancing weight control and reducing reflux without the risks associated with synthetic gastric band. This single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled 1000 patients with body mass index (BMI) 30–50 kg/m2, allocated into two groups: the experimental group underwent OAGB with the FundoRing modification and hiatal repair when indicated, while the control group underwent standard OAGB. Patients will be followed for up to 60 months. Primary outcomes include changes in BMI, remission of comorbidities, and quality of life improvement. Secondary endpoints assess reflux parameters, gastric pouch dilation, intraoperative perfusion imaging, and cost-effectiveness. The FundoRing technique offers a physiologic, autologous alternative to conventional banding methods, aiming to strengthen the restrictive effect of OAGB while minimizing complications. Results from this large-scale trial are expected to clarify the role of FundoRing OAGB in optimizing long-term bariatric and metabolic outcomes.

                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease caused by a primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. This case report describes a rare transmission of chickenpox potentially linked to an indirect route via surface contamination rather than direct person-to-person contact. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus, lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient’s face, neck, and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body, and the rest of the body, except the legs, hands, genital areas, and buttocks, was also highly infected. Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons. The patient showed marked improvement within a week and fully recovered without complications or post-herpetic sequelae. This case emphasizes the importance of strict infection control and hygiene protocols in preventing rare indirect transmission of the VZV, particularly in healthcare settings.

                1) Introduction Cognitive enhancers, or nootropics, are agents that aim to improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive processing. This bibliometric study investigates the scientific landscape surrounding Ginkgo biloba as a cognitive enhancer, using data retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed via Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. This bibliometric study analyzes literature from Scopus to identify key trends, influential authors, and research gaps, providing guidance for future research. 2) Methods This study employs a literature review methodology to gather data from the Scopus database on Neuroaid, analyzing it using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software. The focus was on Ginkgo Biloba as a niche-theme cognitive enhancer agent based on Scopus data, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses. 3) Results and discussion Ginkgo biloba, the ‘maidenhair tree’ from the order Ginkgoales, appeared 290 million years ago. Chinese and Japanese culture has been cultivated for thousands of years. This tree is valued for its resilience and therapeutic properties, often used in traditional medicine for respiratory and blood circulation issues. 4) Conclusions This bibliometric analysis reveals that Ginkgo biloba remains a focal point in cognitive enhancer research, with increasing scholarly attention over the past decade. Despite its historical and cultural significance, the literature shows fragmented research clusters and limited clinical consensus. The study highlights the need for standardized methodologies, stronger interdisciplinary collaboration, and more rigorous clinical trials to validate Ginkgo biloba’s cognitive benefits. These findings provide a roadmap for future research and underscore the importance of bridging traditional knowledge with modern scientific inquiry. This study was conducted in December 2024.

                This case report describes an exceedingly rare complication of endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) surgery. We reported a delayed remote combined supratentorial intracerebral and subdural haemorrhage following the resection of a tuberculum sella meningioma. This report aims to analyse the pathophysiology and discuss the management of this critical complication, which is seldom documented in the literature. We present the case of a 54-year-old female with a WHO Grade I tuberculum sella meningioma. She underwent a complete (Simpson Grade I) resection via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Her initial postoperative recovery was unremarkable for four days. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient experienced an acute decline in consciousness. An emergency non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a remote left parietal intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) of approximately 20cc, associated with an acute left frontoparietal subdural haematoma (SDH), causing a significant midline shift. Despite the severity of the radiological findings, the patient was managed successfully with non-operative medical therapy. She made a full clinical recovery, and a three-month follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete resolution of the haematomas with no evidence of residual tumour or underlying vascular malformation. The clinical timeline and radiological pattern strongly suggest a venous aetiology. The most plausible mechanism is a cascade initiated by an occult cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, leading to intracranial hypotension, cerebral ptosis, and the subsequent rupture of a cortical bridging vein. This case underscores the need for a high index of suspicion for remote intracranial haemorrhage (RIH) in any patient with delayed neurological deterioration after transsphenoidal surgery. Furthermore, it demonstrates that this life-threatening complication can often be managed successfully with conservative therapy.

                Background Phacoemulsification is one of the most frequent surgeries in the world. However, prolonged use of phacoemulsification machines produces reactive oxygen species which will damage corneal endothelial cells. Ascorbic acid has an antioxidant capacity to neutralize oxidative stress in the anterior chamber. This study will investigate the protective effect of ascorbic acid on corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nuclear cataracts. Methods This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Samples will be divided into three groups, and 500 mg of vitamin C, tid, or placebo will be received for seven weeks. Clinical characteristics, ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity of patients in serum and aqueous humor will be measured before and after intervention and phacoemulsification. Conclusions Data from this study will reveal the protective effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on the corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nucleus cataracts.

                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria including construct validity, predictive validity, intra and inter rater reliability, sensitivity to change, ease of use, sensibility, format, and alignment with the biopsychosocial pain model. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Alignment with the biopsychosocial pain model, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

Some infections may be sustained in the human population by persistent transmission among patients in healthcare facilities, including patients colonized with multi-drug-resistant organisms posing a major health threat. A nuanced understanding of facility characteristics that contribute to crossing a threshold for self-sustaining outbreak potential may be crucial to designing efficient interventions for lowering regional disease burden and preventing high-risk infections. Using a mathematical model, we define the facility basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, where a single facility can sustain an outbreak without ongoing importation under the threshold condition <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> > 1. We define <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for a general model with heterogeneous patient susceptibility and transmissibility and with generic length-of-stay assumptions, and we provide a software package for numerical calculation of user-defined examples. We estimate <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> using published data for carbapenemase–producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in long-term acute-care hospitals (LTACHs) and the effects of interventions on <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, including surveillance, pathogen reduction treatments, and length-of-stay reduction. In a simple model, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is directly proportional to the sum of the mean and variance-to-mean ratio of the length-of-stay distribution. In intervention models, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> depends on the moment-generating function of the length-of-stay distribution. From the CPE data, we estimated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.45) prior to intervention. Weekly surveillance with 50% transmission reduction of detected patients alone could have reduced <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> to 0.85 (0.72, 0.98), with additional reduction if detected patients could be decolonized. Reducing the mean length of stay does not necessarily reduce <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> if the variance-to-mean ratio is not also reduced. We conclude that <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> > 1 conditions plausibly exist in LTACHs, where CPE outbreaks could be sustained by patients who acquire colonization and subsequently transmit to other patients during the same hospital stay. Our findings illuminate epidemiological mechanisms producing those conditions and their relationship to interventions that could efficiently improve population health.

                <p>by Haitao Li, Long Zheng, Lei Li, Yiwei Chen, Junjie Li, Chunhou Zheng, Yansen Su</p>

Cancer drug combination therapies offer a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy, but identifying synergistic drug pairs is challenging due to complex biological interactions and tumor heterogeneity. Current machine learning algorithms for drug synergy prediction primarily rely on large-scale, multimodal datasets, yet suffer from critical limitations including poor interpretability, difficulty distinguishing causative biological relationships from correlations, and inadequate modeling of cancer-specific molecular interactions. To address these challenges, we propose CASynergy (Causal Attention and Cross-attention Synergy), a novel deep learning model for predicting cancer drug synergy that addresses limitations of prior approaches in accuracy and interpretability. CASynergy introduces a causal attention mechanism to distinguish true causal genomic features from spurious correlations, cell line-specific gene network construction to capture the unique molecular context of each cancer cell line, and a cross-attention module to integrate drug molecular features with cell line gene expression profiles. These improvements allow CASynergy to clearly identify significant drug-gene interactions and provides interpretable insights into why a combination is predicted to be synergistic. Experiments on two benchmark datasets (DrugCombDB and Oncology-Screen) suggests that CASynergy outperformed five state-of-the-art models. CASynergy offers a better and more reliable way to predict effective drug combinations. It works well across different cancer types and is easier to understand, which is important for personalized cancer treatment and finding new drugs.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to devastating physical, psychological, and financial impacts on millions of people across the world. Amidst a rapidly evolving research landscape, the global scientific community was forced to swiftly adapt to novel working methods, including remote collaboration tools, virtual conferences, and online research platforms. Surveys of life sciences researchers have indicated that computational biologists experienced less disruption and a smoother transition to remote working than experimental biologists, due to their reduced reliance on laboratory equipment. Despite this adaptability, the sudden shift to remote work, compounded by stress and social isolation, has posed significant mental health challenges for these workers. However, remote work has also facilitated opportunities for more flexible work arrangements and increased collaboration across geographical boundaries. To investigate these impacts, we conducted surveys of computational biologists during the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conferences in 2020 and 2021, which were held virtually due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. This study implements a thorough statistical analysis of the survey results to offer insights into the repercussions of the lockdowns on researchers and their work. Key areas of investigation include the effects of institutional support (or lack thereof), the difference in productivity compared to pre-lockdown levels, and the significance of gender in determining these impacts. Notably, a lack of institutional support with regard to mental health and finances was shown to have a significant negative effect on early-career researchers. Although limited by a small sample size, our study sets the stage for a more robust exploration of these trends in future research. Importantly, by illuminating the challenges and opportunities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, our study offers hope for potential solutions supporting the well-being of early-career researchers in unprecedented circumstances.

Multiplexed imaging allows multiple cell types to be simultaneously visualised in a single tissue sample, generating unprecedented amounts of spatially-resolved, biological data. In topological data analysis, persistent homology provides multiscale descriptors of “shape" suitable for the analysis of such spatial data. Here we propose a novel visualisation of persistent homology (PH) and fine-tune vectorisations thereof (exploring the effect of different weightings for persistence images, a prominent vectorisation of PH). These approaches offer new biological interpretations and promising avenues for improving the analysis of complex spatial biological data especially in multiple cell type data. To illustrate our methods, we apply them to a lung data set from fatal cases of COVID-19 and a data set from lupus murine spleen.

Understanding tissue morphogenesis is an important goal in developmental biology and tissue engineering. Accurately describing tissue deformation processes and how cell rearrangements contribute to these is a challenging task. Live analysis of morphogenesis in 3D is frequently used to obtain source data that allow to extract such features from developing organs. However, several limitations are encountered when applying these methodologies to mammalian embryos. The mouse embryo is the most frequently used model, but most studies use a very limited number of specimens and present only individual acquisitions due to constraints imposed by embryo culture and imaging. Here, we leverage live imaging of mouse heart development to build a novel computational framework that overcomes these limitations. Our methodology first extracts tissue dynamics from individual specimens and then integrates these fragmented datasets into a deterministic and dynamic consensus model of heart development. This integrated model allows us to quantify patterns of tissue growth and anisotropy and generate an in-silico fate map of cardiomyocyte trajectories. This work provides a foundational toolkit for dissecting the complex morphogenetic processes underlying mammalian organogenesis, converting collections of variable live images into robust, quantitative blueprints of development.

                <p>by Mogan Gim, Jaewoo Kang, Donghyeon Park, Minji Jeon</p>

CYP450 isoenzymes are known to be deeply involved in the formation of drug-food interactions (DFI). Previously introduced computational approaches for predicting DFIs do not take drug-CYP450 interactions (DCI) into account and have limited generalizability in handling compounds unseen during model training. We introduce ArcDFI, a model that utilizes attention regularization guided by CYP450 interactions to predict drug-food interactions. Experiments on DFI prediction—evaluated under stringent cold-drug and cold-food settings—show that our model outperforms ten baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating CYP450 interactions. Analysis of its attention mechanism provides insight into its current understanding of DCI and how they are related to its DFI predictions. To the best of our knowledge, ArcDFI is the first DFI prediction model that incorporates the concept of DCI, resulting in improved predictive generalizability and model explainability. ArcDFI is available at https://github.com/KU-MedAI/ArcDFI.

                <p>by Thomas Badet, Daniel Croll</p>

Fungal genome sizes exhibit more than a 100-fold variation, largely driven by the expansion of repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs). Silencing mechanisms targeting TEs at the epigenetic or transcript level have independently evolved in many lineages. In fungi, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) targets TEs by recognizing repetitive sequences and inducing mutagenesis. However, the prevalence of RIP across the fungal kingdom and the fidelity of the canonical C-to-T mutation signatures remain unclear. In this study, we address these gaps by tracking shifts in genome architecture across the fungal kingdom. We find that a striking approximately 30-fold increase in genome size within a clade of leotiomycetes is associated with the absence of several RIP-related genes, suggesting a relaxation of genome defense mechanisms during this expansion. To track the impact of genome defenses, we designed a quantitative screen for RIP-like mutation signatures. The phylum of ascomycetes was unique in showing enrichment in mutation signatures in non-coding and repetitive sequences, consistent with a phylogenetically restricted occurrence of RIP-like genome defense systems. Then, we performed a phylogeny-aware association study to identify gene functions associated with RIP-like mutation signatures. We identified a zinc-finger protein as the strongest candidate underpinning a novel mechanism of genome defenses. Our findings reveal the multifaceted drivers of genome defense systems and their close ties to genome size evolution in fungi, particularly in lineages with evidence for recent RIP activity, highlighting how proximate molecular mechanisms can shape genome evolution on deep phylogenetic scales.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Norepinephrine, acting through β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), has a key role in hippocampus-dependent forms of learning. Although β-AR activation also facilitates the induction of Hebbian LTP, recent findings indicate that a non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, known as behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), underlies hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. To explore the role of noradrenergic signaling in BTSP, I investigated the effects of the β-AR activation on complex spike (CS) burst-dependent LTP, a form of BTSP induced by theta-pulse stimulation (TPS) protocols in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. β-AR activation not only enhanced the homosynaptic potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by TPS but also modulated heterosynaptic forms of plasticity critical for CS burst-dependent LTP induction. Specifically, β-AR activation enhanced the heterosynaptic facilitation of CS bursting induced by brief TPS trains and facilitated the ability of synapses to interact in a cooperative fashion to undergo LTP, even when independent groups of synapses were activated up to 10 s apart. β-AR activation also enhanced a CS burst-dependent form of heterosynaptic depression elicited by longer trains of TPS, resulting in a winner-take-all form of synaptic competition where the β-AR-mediated facilitation of LTP induction at one group of synapses was associated with a strong, heterosynaptic suppression of LTP at other synapses. Together, these findings indicate that β-AR activation dynamically regulates fundamental properties of CS burst-dependent synaptic plasticity by modulating multiple forms of heterosynaptic plasticity.</p>

                Zheng et al. find that female mice establish social hierarchies but exhibit a weaker winner effect compared with males. This difference is linked to attenuated LTP at MDT-to-dmPFC synapses due to heightened excitability of dmPFC parvalbumin interneurons. These findings reveal the circuit and neuronal mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic dominance behaviors.

                DNA-RNA hybrids at double-strand breaks are regulated to ensure efficient homologous recombination. Sun et al. show that IGF2BP2 and DHX9 remove hybrids in an m6A-dependent manner, enabling RAD51 loading and promoting DNA repair, with implications for improving cancer therapy.

                By directly imaging climbing fibers, Scheer and Prsa show that they flexibly encode sensory events, reflecting stimulus identity, behavioral outcome, and even context during idle periods. The value of encoded information scales with event modality and cell’s complexity. These findings highlight adaptive, context-sensitive olivocerebellar signaling for organizing multifaceted behavior.

                Li et al. demonstrate that the RNA helicase DDX24 is essential for maintaining blood-brain barrier (BBB) homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial function in cerebral endothelial cells. Specifically, DDX24 regulates the expression of PPFIA4 by binding to its mRNA and enhancing its stability. This offers a potential therapeutic strategy for BBB-related diseases.

Using this olfactory working memory and implicit timing task, they demonstrate that sequential activity in hippocampal CA1 is a shared mechanism for the encoding of working memory and timing.

                Carbon and nitrogen metabolisms are two fundamental metabolic processes in plants, and their coordination is crucial for optimizing plant growth and development. Wang et al. demonstrate that nitrate starvation interrupts light-induced stomatal opening through a long-distance CEP1-CEPR2-BIK1 signaling cascade, which induces H2O2 accumulation in guard cells, ultimately inhibiting photosynthesis.

                Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological, environmental, and dynamic single-cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data from mouse models. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

">REST elevation-dependent chromatin remodeling and alternative Grk6 transcript synthesis hyperactivates Cxcr4-Sdf1 signaling in cerebellar granule cell progenitors</a></h4>

              
                RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) is a repressor of transcriptional initiation of genes involved in neurogenesis. Here, we show that conditional REST elevation in cerebellar granule cell progenitors (CGNPs) of RESTTG mice perturbed foliation, increased cell migration, and sustained C-X-C motif receptor 4 (Cxcr4) signaling, a pathway key to postnatal CGNP migration. Mechanistic studies uncovered a novel role for REST in controlling transcript diversity and exon skipping in CGNPs. Alternative transcript expression was detected in known Cxcr4 signaling regulator, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-6 (Grk6). Further analysis of Grk6 isoform expression revealed an upregulation of a transcript lacking exon 10a (Grk6-207) in RESTTG CGNPs. Grk6-207 expression in wildtype CGNPs hyperactivated Cxcr4 signaling and increased chemotaxis. Structural modeling of Grk6-207 predicted changes in active site conformation and interactions with Cxcr4 and {beta}-Arrestin-1, supporting impairment of Cxcr4 signaling desensitization. Interestingly, REST elevation promoted increased chromatin accessibility at the exon10a-10b junction and exon 10a exclusion. Integrated multiomic analyses identified the enhancer of zeste (Ezh2) as a potential mediator of alternative transcript generation which demonstrated increased occupancy at the exon10a-10b locus in RESTTG CGNPs. Pharmacological inhibition of Ezh2 downregulated Grk6-207, confirming a role for Ezh2 in Grk6 exon10a exclusion and the increased migration in RESTTG CGNPs.

">Hippocampal grey matter changes across scales in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by deterioration in cognitive function including extensive memory impairment. The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe region, is a key orchestrator in the encoding and retrieval of memory and is believed to be one of the first regions to deteriorate in AD. In this work we examined hippocampal macrostructure (specifically gyrification and thickness) and microstructure in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to healthy aged controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We first utilized an iterative training paradigm to adapt an existing deep learning approach for capturing hippocampal topology to elderly individuals as well as individuals with potential hippocampal degeneration. Using this new model, we found notable decreases in both thickness and gyrification in AD and MCI across both the subfields and anterior-posterior axis. Using the diffusion tensor representation derived from diffusion MRI data, we found significant increases in the mean diffusivity across the extent of the hippocampus in AD and MCI, which may be related to a number of changes such as loss of neuronal cells, decreased fiber density, demyelination, and increased presence of CSF. Examining the primary direction of diffusion relative to canonical hippocampal axes, we found distinct diffusion orientation shifts in AD and MCI throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the subiculum and CA1. Specifically, we found a decrease in diffusion oriented tangentially, and an increase in diffusion oriented along the long-axis. This could potentially be related to the known degeneration of the perforant path, which is greatly affected in AD and is a largely tangential oriented pathway. The AD-related changes in diffusion orientations were found to not have significant spatial overlap with AD-related changes in mean diffusivity, suggesting that they may be capturing distinct spatially-localized disease processes. Finally, we showed that the macro- and microstructure of the hippocampus in AD changed less across age relative to MCI and controls. As well, the age-related hippocampal macrostructure changes in MCI appeared indistinguishable from healthy aging.

">The difference in immunohistochemical reactivity of monoclonal antibodies against amino-terminal residues of amyloid-β peptide</a></h4>

              
                Immunohistochemistry for amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptide is an indispensable method for Alzheimers disease (AD) research. Despite a wide variety of available antibodies against the peptides, the difference of immunohistochemical reactivity is not fully described among anti-A{beta} antibodies. Immunohistochemical reactivity of Abs against A{beta} peptides is critical for accurate and reliable evaluation of A{beta} burden in patients as well as models of AD. Here, we examined immunohistochemical reactivity of two mouse and one rabbit monoclonal antibodies against A{beta} N-terminal regions using two AD mouse models, AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F. 6E10, 82E1 and D54D2 A{beta} antibodies were used in this study. We found significant differences in the immunohistochemical reactivity in both AppNL-F and AppNL-G-F models. While 6E10 immunoreactivity was mainly localized to A{beta} plaques, D54D2 and 82E1 antibodies stained much more broadly beyond plaques. Interestingly, the latter two Abs showed blurred filamentous immunoreactivity beyond amyloid plaque cores. Double immunostaining using a tyramide signal amplification method, Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase (FT-GO), suggested that the differential immunohistochemical outcomes were only partially attributable to their sensitivity. Moreover, heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) did not affect the differential immunohistochemical outcomes. Our analysis indicates that outcomes of A{beta} immunohistochemistry highly depends on the antibody used in the study.

">An EEG Investigation of Neural Dynamics of Empathy Influenced by Congruent and Incongruent Pain Expressions in Autistic and Neurotypical Adults</a></h4>

              
                Autistic individuals often show difficulties in empathy, but the underlying neural mechanisms of empathy in naturalistic contexts of pain have been less examined. This study employed a kinetic pain empathy paradigm, manipulating the congruence between pain expressions, i.e., body gestures and facial expressions based on a predictive coding framework. We collected EEG data from 51 autistic and 58 neurotypical adults during a pain observation task. Results indicated that autistic and neurotypical adults share a similar neural architecture for empathy processing and conflict resolution, involving an early stage of sensory arousal (i.e., N2 and theta) and a later stage of cognitive reappraisal (i.e., P3). However, the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed nuanced but significant between-group differences in neural patterns. Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adults demonstrated atypical processes in both empathy and conflict resolution. Specifically, they exhibited heightened early emotional arousal but expended greater cognitive effort to evaluate others' pain. Autistic adults also showed increased alertness to unexpected sensory input and allocated more cognitive resources to resolve prediction errors from incongruent pairings. In contrast, neurotypical adults suppressed unnecessary cognitive efforts for meaningless errors. In summary, autistic adults may experience challenges in efficiently adjusting predictions to the external context, with their neural processing heavily depending on sensory input and less efficient in adapting cognitive resources to evaluate and respond to varied contextual demands.

">Developmental sleep reallocation enables metabolic adaptation in desert flies</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential for adaptation and survival across the lifespan, yet the ecological pressures shaping sleep ontogeny remain poorly understood. We investigated sleep across early developmental stages in Drosophila mojavensis, a stress-resilient desert-adapted species. While adult D.mojavensis exhibit prolonged and consolidated sleep, along with enhanced starvation tolerance and survival compared to Drosophila melanogaster, the developmental trajectory underlying these adaptation strategies for surviving in harsh environments is unknown. Moreover, during developmental (larval) periods, animals do not encounter the same environmental stressors experienced by adults (e.g., food scarcity, extreme temperatures). We find that in contrast to adults, D.mojavensis larvae exhibit reduced and fragmented sleep relative to D.melanogaster. D.mojavensis larval sleep is also deeper, reflecting a shift toward increased sleep efficiency rather than simple sleep loss. D.mojavensis larvae consume more food than D.melanogaster and survive longer under starvation, suggesting a strategic tradeoff by suppressing sleep to prioritize nutrient intake and energy storage early in life while resources are more abundant. Metabolic analyses reveal elevated triglyceride accumulation in D.mojavensis across their lifespan, indicating enhanced energy storage capacity. These findings provide an example of how, within a fixed genetic background, an animal can reallocate sleep in opposing manners to maximize survival and energetics depending upon ecological pressures unique to each phase of life.

">Spatial and semantic memory reorganize a hippocampal long-axis gradient</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports episodic memory by binding spatial and semantic information, yet how this information is simultaneously organized along its long axis remains debated. Gradient accounts propose a continuous shift in representational scale, from coarse coding in anterior to fine coding in posterior regions, whereas modular accounts posit discrete subregions specialized for distinct functions. Using high-resolution fMRI together with eye tracking as a readout of spatial and semantic memory during sequence learning, we directly tested these competing models. During predictable sequences, hippocampal activity continuously varied along the long axis. In contrast, modular organization emerged when sequences mismatched memory. Subregions in the anterior and posterior hippocampus were sensitive to semantic and spatial mismatches, respectively. Notably, the intermediate hippocampus was specifically sensitive to concurrent mismatches in both dimensions, but not to mismatches in either dimension alone. These content-sensitive subregions were embedded within distinct cortical networks that reorganized according to memory demands. Together, our findings show the hippocampus flexibly combines gradient and modular dynamics to simultaneously represent the spatial and semantic content that defines episodic memory.

">Using Information Geometry to Characterize Higher-Order Interactions in EEG</a></h4>

              
                In neuroscience, methods from information geometry (IG) have been successfully applied in the modelling of binary vectors from spike train data, using the orthogonal decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information to isolate different orders of interaction between neurons. While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.

">Knockdown of endothelial Serpine1 improves stroke recovery by attenuating peri-infarct blood flow and blood brain barrier disruption</a></h4>

              
                Focal stroke leads to complex changes in the cerebral microcirculation in surviving brain tissues that strongly influence recovery. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; encoded by Serpine1) is highly upregulated in endothelial cells after stroke. Since the primary function of PAI-1 is to inhibit fibrin clot breakdown, we hypothesized that blocking this pathway would be beneficial for recovery since it is expected to increase capillary blood flow after stroke. Using longitudinal in vivo imaging in mice subjected to ischemic stroke, we unexpectedly found that knockdown of Serpine1 in brain endothelial cells leads to a long-lasting reduction in peri-infarct capillary width, red blood cell velocity and flux. Conversely, stimulating this pathway in naive mice increased capillary width and blood flow. Lowered peri-infarct blood flow in Serpine1 knockdown mice attenuated deleterious blood brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Serpine1 knockdown improved the progressive recovery of sensory evoked cortical responses, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor function. These findings challenge the assumption that increased blood flow after stroke is better for recovery and reveal that carefully tuning flow, rather than maximizing it, may be optimal. Further our data highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting endothelial Serpine1/PAI-1 signalling in promoting stroke recovery.

">Representational Competition of Spatially and Temporally Overlapped Target and Distractor</a></h4>

              
                Representational competition occurs when a task-relevant target stimulus and a distractor overlap in space and time. Given limited neural resources, it is expected that stronger representations of the distractor will result in weaker representations of the target, leading to poorer behavioral performance. We tested this hypothesis by recording fMRI while participants (n = 27) viewed a compound stimulus consisting of randomly moving dots (the target) superimposed on IAPS affective pictures (the distractor). Each trial lasted ~12 seconds, during which the moving dots and the IAPS pictures were flickered at 4.29 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. The task was to detect and report brief episodes of coherent motion in the moving dots. Depending on the emotion category of the IAPS pictures, the trials were classified as pleasant, neutral and unpleasant. Focusing on three ROIs: middle temporal cortex (MT), ventral visual cortex (VVC), as well as the primary visual cortex (V1), we performed MVPA analysis to decode the distractor categories in each ROI, and correlated the decoding accuracy, taken to index the strength of distractor representation, with the accuracy in detecting the episodes of coherent motion. The following results were found: (1) the decoding accuracy was above chance level in all ROIs, and (2) in MT and VVC but not in V1, the higher the decoding accuracy, the worse the behavioral performance. These results suggested that distractor information was represented in V1 as well as in the two motion-processing areas, and in the motion-processing areas, stronger representations of the distractor led to poorer ability to process attended information, leading to worse behavioral performance. The hypothesis was thus supported and trade-offs in the fidelity of stimulus representations prompted by neural competition demonstrated.

">Gene therapy-mediated overexpression of wild-type MFN2 improves Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is the most common axonal CMT and is associated with an early onset and severe motor-dominant phenotype. CMT2A is mainly caused by dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, encoding Mitofusin-2, a GTPase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in MFN2 are known to affect mitochondrial dynamics. We previously demonstrated that the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln further disrupts contacts between the ER and the mitochondria, leading to progressive axonal degeneration. There is no effective therapeutic approach to slow or reverse the progression of CMT2A, and treatments currently under development primarily focus on restoring mitochondrial function. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that neuronal overexpression of wild-type MFN2 (MFN2WT) provides therapeutic benefit in transgenic CMT2A mice carrying the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln. Intrathecal delivery of an AAV9 vector expressing MFN2WT effectively targets motor and sensory neurons, restoring ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial morphology, thereby preserving both neuromuscular junction integrity and motor function. Strikingly, therapeutic efficacy is also achieved following vector injection after the onset of symptoms, rescuing the molecular hallmarks of CMT2A pathology and reversing locomotor. Notably, AAV administration was well tolerated, with no evidence neither of hepatotoxicity nor dorsal root ganglion inflammation. These results establish that boosting MFN2 levels using gene therapy is a promising therapeutic avenue for CMT2A

">Mismatch negativity develops in adolescence and independently of microglia</a></h4>

              
                Higher brain functions and cognition undergo a critical period of development during adolescence, when psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia typically onset. Understanding how developmental processes during adolescence interact with schizophrenia pathophysiology and risk remains a central goal in psychiatry. Here we show that a well-established biomarker of schizophrenia, mismatch negativity, matures during adolescence in mouse primary visual cortex, along with a strengthening of fronto-visual functional connectivity. Because microglia are implicated in schizophrenia risk and disease states, we further investigated what role microglia may play in the development of mismatch responses under physiological conditions. We found that microglial depletion with PLX5622 in adolescence arrests the development of resting oscillations in frontal areas, but does not affect the development of deviance detection, other signatures of visual context processing, or prefrontal-visual functional connectivity. Our findings suggest (a) a key component of mismatch negativity develops in adolescence, a period of vulnerability to schizophrenia, and (b) the development underlying this component does not require robust microglia activity, clarifying the developmental role of microglia in higher order visual processing.

">Microglial morphology reflects cognitive status in the aging rat brain</a></h4>

              
                Age-related cognitive decline affects millions of individuals worldwide, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this decline remain incompletely understood. Microglia undergo significant changes with aging, including alterations in morphology, that may reflect or contribute to cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between specific microglial morphologies and cognitive performance in relevant brain regions remains poorly understood. To address this, we evaluated the relationship between morphology-based microglial phenotypes and cognitive performance across domains affected by aging. Microglial morphology was analyzed in four cognitive brain regions of male and female 3-, 9-, and 15-month-old rats and features were subjected to hierarchical clustering on principal components to identify microglial subtypes. Rats underwent cognitive testing using a radial arm water maze and a T-maze set-shifting task to assess spatial working and reference memory, striatal-based learning, and cognitive flexibility. We observed age-related cognitive impairments alongside region-specific changes in microglial morphotype abundance. Importantly, the relative abundance of distinct microglial clusters correlated with cognitive performance in functionally relevant brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings highlight the utility of morphological profiling in capturing microglial heterogeneity and suggest that morphological changes may reflect or contribute to cognitive decline during aging.

">Biomimetic Cues Enable Predictive Mechanisms in Simulatedand Physical Robot-Human Object Handovers</a></h4>

              
                Object handovers - while representing one of the simplest forms of physical interaction between two agents - involve a complex interplay of predictive and reactive control mechanisms in both agents. As human-human pairs have unrivaled skills in physical collaboration tasks, we take the approach of understanding and applying biomimetic concepts to human-robot interaction. Here, we apply the concept of passer movement cues, that is, slower movement for heavy objects and faster movements for lighter objects, to robot-human handovers. We first show that when a simulated passing agent's movement is scaled with object mass, participants as receivers adapt their anticipatory grip forces according to mass in a virtual environment. We then apply the same concept to a physical robot-human handover and show that our approach generalizes to the real-world. The predictive scaling of grip forces is learned iteratively upon repeated presentations of trajectory-mass pairings, whether the masses are presented in a random or blocked order. Overall we demonstrate that the presentation of robotic kinematic cues can provide intuitive and naturalistic human predictive control in object handover. This extends the use of non-verbal cues in robot-human handover tasks and facilitates more legible and efficient physical robot-human interactions.

">Detection of probable neuronal gene expression changes in skin biopsies from patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Our inability to obtain nerve samples from the vast majority of neuropathic pain patients impedes our ability to understand the disease, creates challenges in understanding mechanisms in specific patient populations, and limits our ability to make treatment decisions based on quantifiable molecular data. Fields like oncology have overcome these problems to take advantage of the insight that sequencing offers for understanding mechanisms of disease and have leveraged these molecular insights to dramatically change the treatment landscape in the past decade. Here we tested the hypothesis that skin biopsies could be used to gain insight into neuronal transcriptomic changes in patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Our analysis reveals that hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found through bulk RNA sequencing in these skin biopsies are likely contributed by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal axons and/or terminals. Up-regulated genes were representative of broad class of nociceptors whereas down-regulated genes were associated with putative injured DRG neurons expressing the PDIA2 gene. DEGs that could be confidently associated with specific subsets of skin cells were mostly expressed by keratinocytes supporting a growing literature tying keratinocyte-neuron communication abnormalities to pain in PIPN. Our findings warrant further assessment of skin biopsies in additional neuropathic pain populations to gain insight into DRG neuron changes that have previously been thought to be inaccessible in routine clinical or scientific assessment in most patients.

">Chronic Dietary Exposure to Methylparaben and Ethyl paraben Induces Developmental, Biochemical, and Behavioural Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Parabens, particularly methylparaben (MP) and ethylparaben (EP), are extensively used preservatives in cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Although considered safe at low concentrations, recent evidence questions their biological inertness under chronic exposure. This study evaluated the developmental, biochemical, and behavioural effects of continuous dietary MP and EP exposure in Drosophila melanogaster, an established in vivo model for toxicological screening. Flies were chronically exposed to MP (0.5 to 2%) or EP (0.5 to 1.5%) throughout development and adulthood. Developmental timing, lifespan, oxidative-stress markers (MDA, FRAP, total protein), and locomotor performance (negative geotaxis in adults, crawling in larvae) were quantified. Paraben exposure significantly delayed development (a 15% increase in eclosion time), reduced median lifespan (up to a 50% decrease at 2% MP), and increased oxidative damage (MDA and FRAP) in a dose-dependent manner. Protein content declined more rapidly with age, suggesting oxidative degradation or proteolysis. Both adult climbing and larval crawling performances were impaired, indicating a link between biochemical stress and neuromuscular dysfunction. MP produced stronger oxidative and behavioural effects than EP. Feeding controls confirmed that observed deficits were not due to nutritional differences. Chronic MP and EP exposure induces systemic toxicity in D. melanogaster, integrating endocrine disruption and redox imbalance as plausible mechanisms of action. Given conserved stress and hormonal pathways, these findings reinforce the need to re-evaluate low dose paraben safety limits and highlight Drosophila as a rapid, ethically viable platform for screening environmental preservatives and safer substitutes.

">Uncertainty Shapes Neural Dynamics in Motor Cortex During Reaching</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary reaching movements are often made with incomplete information about the movement goal, which may require the brain to flexibly adjust motor plans and ongoing movements. To examine how uncertainty about a reach target influences neural preparation and execution, we recorded activity from dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices of a rhesus macaque trained to reach to one of two potential targets. In the task, a timing cue flashed three times in succession. Potential targets were displayed at the time of the first flash and the monkey needed to initiate the movement almost simultaneously with the third flash. Colorings of potential targets indicated the probability that the target would be at one location or the other, thereby inducing varying levels of uncertainty about the final target location. On half the trials, the final target was displayed so late that the monkey had to "guess" the target location, based on cues provided by the potential targets. While the monkey performed this task, we recorded 165 neurons from PMd and 37 from M1. Population neural trajectories in the preparatory subspace of PMd (but not M1) were progressively less expansive with higher levels of uncertainty. Despite differences in preparatory states associated with uncertainty, the movements produced were the same. The narrower separation between states suggested a neural-based explanation for more rapid movement re-preparation with higher uncertainty. Furthermore, we found a dimension in neural state-space representing the level of uncertainty during movement preparation and execution.

">Oxidation of ΔFOSB at Cys172 Controls Hippocampal Gene Targets and Learning</a></h4>

              
                Imbalance of reduction/oxidation (redox) in the brain is associated with numerous diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), substance abuse disorders, and stroke. Moreover, cognitive decline can be caused by neuronal dysfunction that precedes cell death, and this dysfunction is in part produced by altered gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which redox state controls gene expression in neurons are not well understood. DeltaFOSB is a neuronally enriched transcription factor critical for orchestrating gene expression underlying memory, mood, and motivated behaviors. It is dysregulated in many conditions including AD. We showed recently that deltaFOSB forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond between cysteine 172 (C172) of deltaFOSB and C279 of its preferred binding partner JUND. This bond works as a redox switch to control DNA-binding, based on studies of recombinant proteins in vitro. Here, we show that this redox control of deltaFOSB function in vitro is conserved in vivo. We show that deltaFOSB C172 forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond with JUND that regulates the stability of this AP1-transcription factor complex and its binding to DNA in cells. We also validate the formation of deltaFOSB-containing complexes held together via disulfide bonds in mouse brain in vivo. We show that exogenous oxidative stress reduces deltaFOSB binding to gene targets in mouse brain and that Fosb C172S knock-in mice, which lack a functional deltaFOSB redox switch, are insensitive to this oxidation-dependent reduction in target gene binding, demonstrating that deltaFOSB is regulated by a redox switch that modulates binding to target genes in the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that FosB C172S knock-in mice are less sensitive to cognitive dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. This evidence supports deltaFOSB as an important mediator of oxidative stress-driven changes in gene expression and cognition and implicates deltaFOSB as a possible therapeutic target for diseases associated with oxidative stress in the brain, including AD.

">Early reduction and impaired targeting of myelin-associated glycoprotein to myelin membranes in Huntington disease</a></h4>

              
                Background. Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary life-threatening disease marked by progressive neuronal loss and atrophy of grey matter structures, particularly the caudate putamen. Brain imaging studies have revealed that the degradation of the white matter occurs many years prior to symptomatic onset and neuronal loss, suggesting that the decay of brain white matter is an active contributor to the disease progression. However, the mechanisms by which the HD mutation triggers white matter loss is not well understood. Methods. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were conducted to assess white matter pathology and explore the relevant mechanisms in CAG140 knock-in mice, which express the HD protein in the same way as patients suffering from HD and thus biologically replicate HD in human. Results. Western blot analysis of proteins localized at different layers of the myelin coat revealed that the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is localized at the innermost layer of the myelin coat and essential for maintaining the periaxonal space and the integrity of the myelin sheath, manifested as an early and progressive decline in HD mouse caudate putamen. The loss of MAG was detected at myelinated axons and in fiber bundles in HD mouse brains at an age when the abundance of myelinated axons was normal. Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies found that MAG labeling was concentrated in the soma of a subset of oligodendrocytes, which expressed breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1, a marker for new oligodendrocytes. While their abundance was normal, new oligodendrocytes in HD mouse caudate appeared to be impeded in acquiring the expression of MAG and in targeting MAG away from perinuclear punctate structures to processes, signs of impaired maturation. Compared with those in wildtype mouse brains, oligodendrocytes in HD mouse brains had a reduced abundance of small vesicles whereas an increased abundance of large punctate structures in the perinuclear region, implying defective generation of small vesicles transporting MAG from large punctate structures in the soma to processes. The MAG-containing perinuclear punctate structures were negative for proteins specifying trans-Golgi networks, early endosomes, or exosomes but had a minor portion labeled with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, indicating that the structures where MAG accumulates in the soma are derived from the late endosomal lysosomal compartment. Conclusions. Our study suggests that the decay of the brain white matter in Huntington disease involves a deficit in trafficking of myelin-associated glycoprotein, preventing its proper delivery from the soma of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming processes.

">Persistence of vestibular function in the absence of glutamatergic transmission from hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Quantal synaptic transmission in vestibular end-organs is glutamatergic. Although genetic deletion of Slc17a8 (termed Vglut3) leads to deafness in mice, the dependence of vestibular function on VGLUT3-mediated quantal transmission is unknown. Here, we investigated the vestibular phenotype of Vglut3-/- mice at the cellular, systems, and behavioral levels. The type-II vestibular hair cells (VHCs) in Vglut3+/+ mice were strongly immunoreactive for VGLUT3, while type-I VHCs showed poor immunoreactivity. In Vglut3-/- mice quantal synaptic transmission in utricular calyces was reduced in rate and amplitude by > 95%. In vivo recordings of spontaneous activity in the vestibular nerve revealed similar action potential rates and regularity in Vglut3+/+ and Vglut3 /- mice, suggesting a divergent underlying mechanism compared to the silent Vglut3-/- auditory nerve. In behavioral studies, Vglut3-/- mice did not exhibit considerable sensorimotor or balance deficits. Collectively, these data support the view that non-quantal transmission is the predominant mode of neurotransmission between type I VHCs and vestibular calyceal afferent neurons. We propose that non-quantal transmission alone underlies the apparently normal vestibular nerve physiology and behavioral function in Vglut3-/- mice.

">Decoding with multivariate pattern analysis is superior for optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography compared to superconducting quantum interference device-based systems</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become an increasingly important method for decoding distributed brain activity from neural electrophysiological recordings by leveraging both temporal and spatial features. These multivariate approaches have proven important for both cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. MVPA might benefit from magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), as these sensors can be placed closer to the scalp, providing higher spatial resolution compared to conventional MEG systems that rely on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). As OPM-based MEG systems become available at more institutions, it is essential to experimentally compare their performance with traditional SQUID-based systems using MVPA. Methods: We adapted a visual object-word paradigm from a previous study, originally implemented on a TRIUX MEGIN SQUID system, to the FieldLine HEDscan OPM system. Participants were recruited and we recorded their ingoing brain activity while did the same task in both systems. Visual stimuli of different objects were presented alternately in two modalities: pictures and the corresponding written words. For each modality, MVPA was used to classify the objects from OPM and SQUID magnetometers data respectively. To further investigate the advantages of OPM, we evaluated the effect classification accuracy of two spatial factors by controlling the number of sensors included and the spatial frequency content of the sensor data. Results: We found higher time-resolved decoding accuracy for the OPM compared to the SQUID data. Moreover, OPMs show higher classification performance compared to SQUIDs when controlling for the same number of sensors; consistently, the OPM system required fewer sensors to reach the performance limit of the SQUID system. Our analysis considering the spatial frequency content of the signal revealed that decoding accuracy plateaued for the SQUID system at lower spatial frequencies while the performance of the OPM system continued to improve when higher-order spatial components were included. Conclusion: Our OPM-MEG system outperformed the SQUID-MEG system on MVPA on decoding of visual processing. This advantage of OPM is driven by its higher spatial resolution, resulting from the sensors being positioned closer to the head and thus able to capture higher spatial frequency components of the brain signal. OPM may facilitate cognitive neuroscience research as well as brain-computer interfaces by providing higher sensitivity when employing paradigms using multi-variate data analysis.

">Iron Deficiency Impairs Mitochondrial Energetics and Early Axonal Growth and Branching in Developing Hippocampal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Each stage of neuronal development (i.e., proliferation, differentiation, migration, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation) requires functional and highly coordinated metabolic activity to ultimately ensure proper sculpting of complex neural networks. Energy deficits underlie many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implicating mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target. Iron is necessary for neuronal energy output through its direct role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Iron deficiency (ID) reduces mitochondrial respiratory and energy capacity in developing hippocampal neurons, causing permanently simplified dendritic arbors and impaired learning and memory. However, the effect of ID on early axonogenesis has not been explored. We used an embryonic mixed-sex primary mouse hippocampal neuron culture model of developmental ID to evaluate mitochondrial respiration and dynamics and effects on axonal morphology. At 7 days in vitro (DIV), ID impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and stunted growth of both the primary axon and branches, without affecting branch number. Mitochondrial motility was not altered by ID, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production --- not trafficking --- underlie the axon morphological deficits. These findings provide the first link between iron-dependent neuronal energy production and early axon structural development and emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient iron during gestation to prevent the negative consequences of ID on brain health across the lifespan.

">Functional and Structural Plasticity in Cocaine-Seeking Ensembles of the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                Relapse vulnerability in substance use disorder (SUD) is primarily driven by cue-induced activation of neurons within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), among other contributing factors. Neuronal ensembles within the NAcore, defined here as selectively co-activated neurons during specific behavioral experiences, are essential during cocaine sensitization and recall. While transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) has been widely observed in general neuronal populations within the NAcore during reinstatement, its ensemble-specific dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used c-Fos-TRAP2-based tagging to identify cocaine-seeking ensembles in mice following cocaine intravenous self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Structural spine plasticity was assessed via confocal microscopy, and functional changes were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology across multiple reinstatement time points. Ensemble neurons exhibited enhanced dendritic spine head diameter (dh) and AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratios following cue exposure, consistent with t-SP. Notably, spine classification revealed a reduction in mature spines during reinstatement, suggesting morphological remodeling rather than new spine formation in both ensemble and non-ensemble cells. Non-ensemble neurons exhibited classical functional transient synaptic plasticity, characterized by increased A/N ratios but no significant changes in dh. To begin assessing if presynaptic vesicle release impacts t-SP, paired-pulse ratio analysis indicated no differences in population or time point. Importantly, ensemble neurons displayed elevated A/N ratio following cocaine exposure, suggesting prior silent synapse maturation. These findings demonstrate that t-SP is not uniformly distributed across NAcore neurons but differs significantly between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. By linking ensemble identity to both structural and functional plasticity, this study refines our understanding of cue-induced relapse mechanisms.

">Region-specific human brain organoids reveal synaptic and cell state drivers of glioblastoma invasion</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly heterogenous and malignant brain tumor, in part because it disrupts normal brain circuits to fuel its own growth and invasion. Thus, there is a need to identify the molecular features of invasive GBM cells and their regulators in the neural microenvironment. To address this in a fully human model, we engrafted patient-derived GBM cells (total n=15 independent samples) from three sources - fresh neurosurgical resections, cell lines, and whole GBM organoids - into human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids patterned to forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord identities. GBM cells from all sources infiltrated brain organoids within 2 days post-engraftment, reaching maximal invasion by day 14. Across organoids of distinct spatial and maturational milieu, GBM cells showed a consistent reduction in astrocyte-like states and an enrichment in neuron/glia progenitor-like (NPC-like) states. These NPC-like GBM cells expressed neuronal and synaptic machinery, and tumors enriched in this transcriptomic state prior to engraftment achieved greater organoid coverage, suggesting enhanced infiltration and synaptic integration of this GBM cell type. Although GBM cell states converged across organoid types after engraftment, infiltration was greater in the forebrain than spinal cord. This is likely reflective of synaptic input from deep-layer TBR1 excitatory neurons in the forebrain, as demonstrated by a combination of rabies-based monosynaptic tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. In contrast, inhibitory neurons were the predominant synaptic partners of GBM in the spinal cord. Together, this fully human model of the neural-GBM connectome reveals how neuron-like GBM states and regionally distinct synaptic inputs cooperatively shape tumor invasion.

">Electrical synapses mediate visual approach behavior</a></h4>

              
                Detecting salient visual objects and orienting toward them are commonplace tasks for animals, yet the underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. The fruit fly is an ideal model for a comprehensive analysis of feature detection mechanisms given its complete synaptic wiring diagrams, robust behavioral assays, and cell-type-specific gene expression datasets. We previously showed that columnar visual neurons T3 are required for saccadic orientation toward landscape features during flight. Here, we examine how signals downstream of T3 are processed in the central brain. We identify the LC17 type of visual projection neurons as key postsynaptic targets: they receive strong excitatory input from T3, project to premotor brain regions, and are thus positioned to support visual approach. Using in vivo optical physiology and virtual reality behavior, we demonstrate that LC17 neurons are indeed necessary for object tracking during flight. Furthermore, we find that electrical synapses in LC17 are also required for tracking behavior. Accordingly, we show that the innexin Shaking B (shakB) is highly expressed in LC17 dendrites, and genetic perturbations confirm an essential role for gap junctional coupling in this circuit. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying visual approach, and highlight the interplay between electrical and chemical neurotransmission for rapid object detection and action selection.

">Parallel circadian-like oscillations in LTP and excitation inhibition balance in mouse CA1 reverse direction after puberty</a></h4>

              
                Long-term potentiation (LTP), the best characterized form of Hebbian synaptic plasticity, is well known to be under strong circadian regulation. In mice and rats, both nocturnal species, most studies indicate that LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region is more robust when induced during the dark phase. Our examination of the underlying mechanisms at the CA3 to CA1 synapse provides evidence that the capacity to express LTP does not differ between the light and dark cycles of the 24hour day. Instead, the magnitude of theta-burst stimulation induced LTP (TBSLTP) correlates with daily fluctuations in the ratio of synaptic excitation to inhibition (E/I ratio): both the E/I ratio and TBSLTP are higher during the dark phase. Consistent with a causal relationship, blockade of inhibition abolishes the light dark difference in TBS LTP induction, likewise, pairing induced LTP, which is less constrained by inhibitory recruitment, does not differ between cycles. Supporting this model, using the APP/PS1 model of AD we observed that neither the E/I ratio nor TBSLTP change during the light cycle. Finally, we made the intriguing observation that these daily oscillations reverse direction after puberty in WT mice, shifting from being larger in the dark cycle of 2month old mice to being larger in the light cycle in 8month old mice. This developmental switch may reflect an age-dependent reorganization of circadian control over hippocampal plasticity.

">Ptf1a robustly drives the gliogenic switch in the rodent embryonic cortex in a dosage-dependent manner by activating pro-glial gene expression programs</a></h4>

              
                It is widely believed that the gliogenic switch during rodent embryonic development is governed by the orchestrated crosstalk between a cohort of genes and extracellular cues. Here we report that ectopic expression of the single bHLH factor, pancreas transcription factor 1 (PTF1A), is sufficient to drive radial glial progenitors (RGPs)-regardless of progenitor heterogeneity and developmental stage-to differentiate into glial cells. Ptf1a-expressing RGPs exhibit progenitor behaviors indicative of a neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate transition, resembling endogenous progenitors at the late stages of embryonic development, and preferentially produce OLIG2+ oligodendrocytes in vivo, some of which are positive for PDGFR or CC1. This robust gliogenic competency depends on the dosage of stable Ptf1a expression in RGPs. RNAseq reveals 'the glial transcriptome', including upregulated expression of several notch signaling components and the endothelin receptors in Ptf1a RGPs. We further identify Ednrb as one of the downstream targets of Ptf1a that directs RGPs toward gliogenesis via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, our study uncovers a novel and robust role for Ptf1a in glial fate specification, offering a potential strategy for generating human oligodendrocytes in vitro.

                Determining if repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins contribute to the CAG polyGln-encoding spinocerebellar ataxias (CAG-SCAs) is critical for understanding mechanisms and developing therapies for these diseases. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against polySer and polyLeu repeats and locus specific C-terminal regions show sense polySer (AGC frame) and antisense polyLeu (CUG frame) RAN proteins accumulate in affected grey and white-matter brain regions, throughout the cerebellum and pons, in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 autopsy brains. Cerebellar white matter regions with prominent polySer and polyLeu but minimal polyGln aggregates show demyelination, white matter loss, and activated microglia. In SCA3 mice, RAN proteins accumulate in an age-dependent manner. In neural cells, polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins are toxic and cause autophagic dysfunction. In cells, the FDA-approved drug metformin decreases RAN protein levels and reduces toxicity. Taken together, these data identify sense and antisense RAN proteins as a common molecular mechanism shared by the CAG-SCAs.

">Distinct cortical profiles underlie the common reportability of thought-free experiences</a></h4>

              
                Mind blanking (MB) is a mental state of seemingly no reportable thought content. The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a "rich" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a "simpler" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow wave activity, tying MB's topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MB's neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.

">Heterogeneity of ictal firing during generalized seizures in the awake cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortico-thalamo-cortical oscillations are central to both normal and pathological brain activities and emerge from complex cortical and thalamic interactions. However, the specific activity of identified cortical neurons during the paroxysmal oscillations associated with absence seizures (ASs) in awake animals remains underexplored. The dominant narrative suggests that seizures indiscriminately disrupt cortical activity through generalized hyperexcitability, but direct evidence supporting this view is lacking. Here, we recorded single units from pyramidal neurons and different interneuron subtypes in the neocortex of two validated rodent models of absence epilepsy under awake, behaving conditions. We find that neurons maintain their firing rank order across interictal and ictal states, regardless of whether their ictal firing rate increases, decreases, or remains stable compared to the interictal phase. Rather than a random cortical takeover, ictal activity represents a scalable modulation of pre-existing network states. These results challenge the generalized hyperexcitability model and highlight the structured, heterogeneous nature of cortical activity during ASs, with implications for mechanistic understanding and targeted therapies.

">Artificial microRNAs targeting Tau enable post-symptomatic functional recovery in aged tauopathy mice</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by the pathological accumulation of tau protein. While tau reduction has emerged as a promising disease-modifying strategy, most preclinical studies have focused on preventive approaches, and the therapeutic potential after clinical onset remains largely unexplored. This limitation is critical, as patients are typically diagnosed after symptoms emerge. Furthermore, global tau suppression may disrupt physiological tau functions and lead to adverse effects, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. RNA-based therapies, particularly microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing, offer high specificity, versatility, and sustained target knockdown. Here, we developed artificial microRNAs (Tau-miRNAs) designed for site-directed expression to selectively reduce tau levels in vulnerable brain regions, thereby minimizing off-target effects. We tested the efficacy of Tau-miRNAs in a tauopathy mouse model at advanced disease stages, delivering them into the prefrontal cortex after cognitive and electrophysiological deficits had developed. This post-symptomatic intervention led to long-term improvements in memory, restoration of neuronal firing properties, and reduced pathological tau at synapses. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of spatially targeted RNA-based tau-lowering strategies for late-stage intervention in tauopathies, addressing a critical unmet need in the treatment of these devastating disorders.
