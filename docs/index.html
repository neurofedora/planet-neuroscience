              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12593">Compensatory Mechanisms in Non-principal Multimedia Learning: The Interplay of Local and Global Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educational multimedia has become increasingly important in modern learning environments because of its cost-effectiveness and ability to overcome the temporal and spatial limitations of traditional methods. However, the complex cognitive processes involved in multimedia learning pose challenges in understanding its neural mechanisms. This study employs network neuroscience to investigate how multimedia design principles influence the underlying neural mechanisms by examining interactions among various brain regions. Two distinct multimedia programs were constructed using identical auditory content but differing visual designs: one adhered to five guidelines for optimizing multimedia instruction, referred to as principal multimedia, while the other intentionally violated these guidelines, referred to as non-principal multimedia. Cortical functional brain networks were then extracted from EEG data to evaluate local and global information processing across the two conditions. Network measurements revealed that principal networks exhibited more efficient local information processing, whereas non-principal networks demonstrated enhanced global information processing and hub formation. Network modularity analysis also indicated two distinct modular organizations, with modules in non-principal networks displaying higher integration and lower segregation than those in principal networks, aligning with initial findings. These observations suggest that the brain may employ compensatory mechanisms to enhance learning and manage cognitive load despite less effective instructional designs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12562">EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important locations or objects and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is a fundamental problem in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. In this study, we show that these irregular dynamics in natural videos can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to perform selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose an experimental paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. We then train a stimulus-informed decoder to extract EEG signal components that are correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and show that this decoder can be used on unseen data to detect which of both objects is attended. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap between the target and the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG also captures information about unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design in related fields.

                arXiv:2308.06578v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just like electrical engineers understand how microprocessors execute programs in terms of how transistor currents are affected by their inputs, neuroscientists want to understand behavior production in terms of how neuronal outputs are affected by their inputs and internal states. This dependency of neuronal outputs on inputs can be described by a state-dependent input-output (IO)-function. However, to reliably identify these IO-functions, we need to perturb each input and combinations of inputs while observing all the outputs. Here, we argue that such completeness is possible in C. elegans; a complete description that goes all the way from the activity of every neuron to predict behavior. The established and growing toolkit of optophysiology can non-invasively capture and control every neuron's activity and scale to countless experiments. The information from many such experiments can be pooled while capturing the inter-individual variability because neuronal identity and function are largely conserved across individuals. Just like electrical engineers use transistor IO-functions to simulate program execution, we argue that neuronal IO-functions could be used to simulate the impressive breadth of brain states and behaviors of C. elegans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19001">Cross-domain Fiber Cluster Shape Analysis for Language Performance Cognitive Score Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.19001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08647">A simple mathematical theory for Simple Volatile Memristors and their spiking circuits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.08647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of neuromorphic (brain-inspired) devices, memristors (memory-resistors) have emerged as effective components for emulating neuronal circuitry. Here we formally define a class of Simple Volatile Memristors (SVMs) based on a simple conductance equation of motion from which we build a simple mathematical theory on the dynamics of isolated SVMs and SVM-based spiking circuits. Notably, SVMs include various fluidic iontronic devices that have recently garnered significant interest due to their unique quality of operating within the same medium as the brain. Specifically we show that symmetric SVMs produce non self-crossing current-voltage hysteresis loops, while asymmetric SVMs produce self-crossing loops. Additionally, we derive a general expression for the enclosed area in a loop, providing a relation between the voltage frequency and the SVM memory timescale. These general results are shown to materialise in physical finite-element calculations of microfluidic memristors. An SVM-based circuit has been proposed that exhibits all-or-none and tonic neuronal spiking. We generalise and analyse this spiking circuit, characterising it as a two-dimensional dynamical system. Moreover, we demonstrate that stochastic effects can induce novel neuronal firing modes absent in the deterministic case. Through our analysis, the circuit dynamics are well understood, while retaining its explicit link with the physically plausible underlying system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12846">How the (Tensor-) Brain uses Embeddings and Embodiment to Encode Senses and Decode Symbols</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor brain has been introduced as a computational model for perception and memory. We provide an overview of the tensor brain model, including recent developments. The tensor brain has two major layers: the representation layer and the index layer. The representation layer is a model for the subsymbolic global workspace from consciousness research. The state of the representation layer is the cognitive brain state. The index layer contains symbols for concepts, time instances, and predicates. In a bottom-up operation, the cognitive brain state is encoded by the index layer as symbolic labels. In a top-down operation, symbols are decoded and written to the representation layer. This feeds to earlier processing layers as embodiment. The top-down operation became the basis for semantic memory. The embedding vector of a concept forms the connection weights between its index and the representation layer. The embedding is the signature or ``DNA'' of a concept, which is decoded by the brain when its index is activated. It integrates all that is known about a concept from different experiences, modalities, and symbolic decodings. Although being computational, it has been suggested that the tensor brain might be related to the actual operation of the brain. The sequential nature of symbol generation might have been a prerequisite to the generation of natural language. We describe an attention mechanism and discuss multitasking by multiplexing. We emphasize the inherent multimodality of the tensor brain. Finally, we discuss embedded and symbolic reasoning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12567">Model calibration using a parallel differential evolution algorithm in computational neuroscience: simulation of stretch induced nerve deficit</a></h4>

Abstract: Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled mechanical electrophysiological model with several free parameters that are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time. While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration in a bundle.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335">Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?"
  This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $L$-Lipschitz function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $Ld/(2n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected $L$-Lipschitz ReLU MLP of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Unlike previously known "large" classes of universal ReLU MLPs, the empirical Rademacher complexity of our class remains bounded even when its depth and width become arbitrarily large. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples.
  We achieve this by avoiding the standard approach to constructing optimal ReLU approximators, which sacrifices regularity by relying on small spikes. Instead, we introduce a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations and avoids these small spikes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12632">Counterfactual Explanations for Clustering Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms rely on complex optimisation processes that may be difficult to comprehend, especially for individuals who lack technical expertise. While many explainable artificial intelligence techniques exist for supervised machine learning, unsupervised learning -- and clustering in particular -- has been largely neglected. To complicate matters further, the notion of a ``true'' cluster is inherently challenging to define. These facets of unsupervised learning and its explainability make it difficult to foster trust in such methods and curtail their adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a new, model-agnostic technique for explaining clustering algorithms with counterfactual statements. Our approach relies on a novel soft-scoring method that captures the spatial information utilised by clustering models. It builds upon a state-of-the-art Bayesian counterfactual generator for supervised learning to deliver high-quality explanations. We evaluate its performance on five datasets and two clustering algorithms, and demonstrate that introducing soft scores to guide counterfactual search significantly improves the results.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12769">The Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks in Communication and its Application towards Network Efficiency in Federated Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained significant interest in on-chip learning in embedded devices and emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, to extend SNNs to a Federated Learning (FL) setting involving collaborative model training, the communication between the local devices and the remote server remains the bottleneck, which is often restricted and costly. In this paper, we first explore the inherent robustness of SNNs under noisy communication in FL. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel Federated Learning with Top-K Sparsification (FLTS) algorithm to reduce the bandwidth usage for FL training. We discover that the proposed scheme with SNNs allows more bandwidth savings compared to ANNs without impacting the model's accuracy. Additionally, the number of parameters to be communicated can be reduced to as low as 6 percent of the size of the original model. We further improve the communication efficiency by enabling dynamic parameter compression during model training. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the baselines in terms of communication cost and model accuracy and are promising for practical network-efficient FL with SNNs.

Abstract: We study feedforward neural networks with inputs from a topological vector space (TVS-FNNs). Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, TVS-FNNs can process a broader range of inputs, including sequences, matrices, functions and more. We prove a universal approximation theorem for TVS-FNNs, which demonstrates their capacity to approximate any continuous function defined on this expanded input space.

                arXiv:2304.12751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.

Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras.

Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and IBM quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.

                arXiv:2409.11430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.

                Background The use of chemical pesticides without proper health literacy (HL) and necessary pesticide protective behaviors (PPB) can result in adverse effects on human health. Methods This study aims to determine if there is a correlation between HL and PPB among farmers in the Nakhon Ratchasima province, using a random sample of 464 farmers. Structured interviews consisted of three parts: 1. General information, 2. Health literacy (including knowledge, understanding, and other sub-aspects), and 3. Protective behaviors against chemical exposure. Each part of the questionnaire had a reliability index of 0.60 or higher. The reliability of the 2nd and 3rd parts of the questionnaire were as follows: sub-sections of part 2 had a Kuder-Richardson (KR-20) coefficient of 0.79 and Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient of 0.85-0.86, while part 3 had an α of 0.88. Risk of chemical exposure was assessed using a Cholinesterase Reactive Paper test administered by a finger-prick blood test. Data was analyzed using the Spearman correlation and binary logistic regression. The study was reviewed by the Human Research Ethics Committee with the approval date: August 9, 2021, and expiry date: August 9, 2022. Results Most participants had moderate levels of overall HL (48.8%) and PPB (44.6%). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between HL and PPB (rs(478) = 0.70, p<.005). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HL had a statistically significant positive association with PPB (p<.001, OR = 6.57, 95% CI 3.95, 10.94) and was associated with blood cholinesterase levels. Conclusions These findings highlight the need for increased health literacy among farmers in Thailand to ensure correct protective behaviors against chemical exposure and reduce the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on human health.

In the absence of these, shade selection becomes challenging and must be done subjectively and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and sex. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades, investigating their correlation with age, sex, and skin shade in a diverse sample of 120 participants. Methods A total of 120 participants, evenly distributed among 60 males and 60 females, were surveyed. Participants were categorized into age groups (n=15) and asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-98/v5?src=rss">Metabolomic characterization of human glioblastomas and patient plasma: a pilot study [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Primary cam morphology, an acquired bony prominence at the head-neck junction of the femur, is highly prevalent in athlete populations, and causally associated with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and early hip osteoarthritis. Experts agreed on key elements for primary cam morphology and a prioritised research agenda for the field. This research agenda will require higher-quality research to achieve meaningful progress on the aetiology, prognosis and treatment of primary cam morphology in athletes. Aim To explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the research field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Methods Grounded in interpretive description, we used semi-structured interviews to explore stakeholders’ perspectives of high-quality research in the primary cam morphology research field. The framework for INcreasing QUality In patient-orientated academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE) informed the interview guide. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. We recruited a heterogenous and purposive maximum variation sample, drawing from a network of research contacts. Results Fifteen individuals, several with multiple perspectives on research quality in the field, participated. Exploring stakeholders’ perspectives on research quality through an established research quality framework (INQUIRE) illuminated areas for immediate action for research communities in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. We crafted five action inviting themes: research communities should: partner with athletes/patients; champion equity, diversity and inclusion; collaborate with one another; pursue open science; and nurture young scholars. Conclusion The findings of this study could inform concrete actions by research communities to pursue higher quality research—more research value and less waste—in the field of primary cam morphology and its natural history. Although the five action-inviting themes reflect contemporary trends in research, and could therefore be transferable to other areas of research, their practical application remains context- and field-specific.

                Background Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is commonly fatal, with an overall mortality rate of nearly 90%, and the risk of subsequent rupture remains high, especially in large aneurysm diameters or progressive disease. Unfavorable neck anatomy in EVAR is linked to early graft failure and long-term complications. Recently, a novel multiple stiff wire (MSW) technique has been developed to overcome the challenges of hostile neck anatomy without introducing additional devices and procedural complexity. It has also been feasible in a series of elective cases. In this case, we report the first-ever utilization of the MSW technique in an emergency case of an acute contained rAAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck who underwent Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR). Case presentation A 61-year-old man came with intermittent sharp stomach pain radiating to his back since three weeks ago. Physical examination showed elevated blood pressure and anemic conjunctiva. Laboratory examinations showed anemia, leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer level, high creatinine level, and low eGFR. CT-Scan Angiography (CTA) revealed severely hostile anatomy, a conical-shaped abdominal aorta aneurysm with a length of 13.2 cm and a maximum diameter of 9.3 cm with angulation of 90.1°. The patient was diagnosed with Ruptured AAA with a conical-shaped, severely angulated neck. Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) management with MSW technique was planned for him. After four days, The patient was discharged in a clinically stable condition with optimal medical treatment and education. Conclusion The endovascular approach could be performed in emergency settings and has been proven to reduce length of stay, mortality, and morbidity rates. In this case, the endovascular approach with the MSW technique showed promising results for the patient.

                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

                <p>by Chonprakun Thagun, Masaki Odahara, Yutaka Kodama, Keiji Numata</p>

Plastids are pivotal target organelles for comprehensively enhancing photosynthetic and metabolic traits in plants via plastid engineering. Plastidial proteins predominantly originate in the nucleus and must traverse membrane-bound multiprotein translocons to access these organelles. This import process is meticulously regulated by chloroplast-targeting peptides (cTPs). Whereas many cTPs have been employed to guide recombinantly expressed functional proteins to chloroplasts, there is a critical need for more efficient cTPs. Here, we performed a comprehensive exploration and comparative assessment of an advanced suite of cTPs exhibiting superior targeting capabilities. We employed a multifaceted approach encompassing computational prediction, in planta expression, fluorescence tracking, and in vitro chloroplast import studies to identify and analyze 88 cTPs associated with <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with phenotypes linked to chloroplast function. These polypeptides exhibited distinct abilities to transport green fluorescent protein (GFP) to various compartments within leaf cells, particularly chloroplasts. A highly efficient cTP derived from <i>Arabidopsis</i> plastid ribosomal protein L35 (At2g24090) displayed remarkable effectiveness in chloroplast localization. This cTP facilitated the activities of chloroplast-targeted RNA-processing proteins and metabolic enzymes within plastids. This cTP could serve as an ideal transit peptide for precisely targeting biomolecules to plastids, leading to advancements in plastid engineering.

<p>High nicotine dose induces anxiety-like behavior in mice in the Open Field Test, alongside oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) reduction in brain regions.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>High doses of nicotine administered to rodents serve as a model for studying anxiety and test compounds' potential anxiolytic effects. At these doses, anxiety in rodents is accompanied by disruption of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The endocannabinoids and nicotine modulate several central nervous system processes via their specific receptors, impacting locomotion, anxiety, memory, nociception, and reward. Cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient of <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L., is devoid of psychoactive actions and has gained attention for its anxiolytic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, among others. This work aims to examine the potential anxiety-reducing properties of CBD in a well-established experimental mouse model of anxiety-like behavior induced by high doses of nicotine on male C57BL/6 mice. In this context, the open-field behavioral test was specially conducted to assess CBD's effects on anxiety-like behavior and locomotion. Brain neuronal plasticity, modulated by BDNF, along with a diverse array of blood's metabolic markers, was examined as a means of evaluating systemic toxicity under various treatments. Finally, oxidative stress was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA), while pro-inflammatory cytokine assessments were conducted to evaluate redox status and immune system function. Our research suggests that CBD shows potential in reducing anxiety-like behaviors induced by high doses of nicotine, by mitigating changes in BDNF protein levels in cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. At the same time, CBD targets specific liver enzymes, maintains tissue's systemic toxicity (i.e., renal, kidney, and pancreatic), balances redox status (SOD, GSH, and MDA), and regulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6).</p>

                Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods This single-center study will recruit 30 participants total aged 50 years or older with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or 60 years or older with TRD; the difference in age limits is because individuals with schizophrenia are biologically about 10 years older than general population owing to metabolic burden. Each participant will receive two consecutive days of 100 mg oral dasatinib plus 1250 mg oral quercetin at baseline and weeks one through three, (i.e., two days on, five days off) along with lifestyle risk management education. Questionnaires and assessments will measure health and cognitive function as well as psychiatric function at baseline, week 10, and one year. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will measure structural and functional brain health at baseline and 10 weeks. Blood sampling for SASP testing will occur at seven time points: baseline, weeks one through four, week 10, and one year. Conclusion This pilot aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the senolytic regimen and D+Q’s potential to counteract accelerated aging in adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and TRD. Trial registration Dasatinib Plus Quercetin for Accelerated Aging in Mental Disorders is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05838560; posted May 1, 2023.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1071/v1?src=rss">Recent Advances in Biopesticide Research and Development: A Focus on Microbial: A Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps are highlighted.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23629?af=R">Don't ignore the middle: Distinct mnemonic functions of intermediate hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23623?af=R">Anatomical and electrophysiological analysis of the fasciola cinerea of the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is considered essential for several forms of declarative memory, including spatial and social memory. Despite the extensive research of the classic subfields of the hippocampus, the fasciola cinerea (FC)—a medially located structure within the hippocampal formation—has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we performed a morpho-functional characterization of principal neurons in the mouse FC. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording of single neurons, we found that FC neurons are distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Specifically, FC neurons displayed non-pyramidal morphology and granule cell-like apical dendrites. Compared to neighboring CA1 pyramidal neurons, FC neurons exhibited more regular in vivo firing patterns and a lower tendency to fire spikes at short interspike intervals. Furthermore, tracing experiments revealed that the FC receives inputs from the lateral but not the medial entorhinal cortex and CA3, and it provides a major intra-hippocampal projection to the septal CA2 and sparser inputs to the distal CA1. Overall, our results indicate that the FC is a morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subfield of the hippocampal formation; given the established role of CA2 in social memory and seizure initiation, the unique efferent intra-hippocampal connectivity of the FC points to possible roles in social cognition and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23624?af=R">Scene construction processes in the anterior hippocampus during temporal episodic memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23628?af=R">Postsynaptic GABAB‐receptor mediated currents in diverse dentate gyrus interneuron types</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The processing of rich synaptic information in the dentate gyrus (DG) relies on a diverse population of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons to regulate cellular and circuit activity, in a layer-specific manner. Metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub>-receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) provide powerful inhibition to the DG circuit, on timescales consistent with behavior and learning, but their role in controlling the activity of interneurons is poorly understood with respect to identified cell types. We hypothesize that GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs display cell type-specific heterogeneity in signaling strength, which will have direct ramifications for signal processing in DG networks. To test this, we perform <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from identified DG principal cells and interneurons, followed by GABA<sub>B</sub>R pharmacology, photolysis of caged GABA, and extracellular stimulation of endogenous GABA release to classify the cell type-specific inhibitory potential. Based on our previous classification of DG interneurons, we show that postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated currents are present on all interneuron types albeit at different amplitudes, dependent largely on soma location and synaptic targets. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs were coupled to inwardly-rectifying K+ channels that strongly reduced the excitability of those interneurons where large currents were observed. These data provide a systematic characterization of GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in the rat DG to provide greater insight into circuit dynamics.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reside in the brain and participate in the mechanism of neurogenesis that permits the brain to generate the building blocks for enhancement of cognitive abilities and acquisition of new skills. The existence of NPCs in brain has opened a novel dimension of research to explore their potential for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The present study provides novel insights into the intracellular mechanisms in neuronal cells proliferation, maturation and differentiation regulated by Quinic acid (QA). Furthermore, this study might help in discovery and development of lead molecule that can overcome the challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth supporting effect of QA was studied using MTT assay. For that purpose, hippocampal cell cultures of neonatal rats were treated with different concentrations of QA and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Gene and protein expressions of the selected molecular markers nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroligin (NLGN) and vimentin were analyzed. QA-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells was also accompanied by significantly increased expression of progenitor and immature neuronal marker, mature neuronal marker and differentiating factor, that is, nestin, Tuj-1, NeuN and NeuroD1, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin downregulation and constant GFAP expression were observed following QA treatment. Additionally, the effects of QA on the recovery of stressed cells was studied using in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). It was observed that hippocampal cells were able to recover from OGD following the treatment with QA. These findings suggest that QA treatment promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by proliferating and differentiating of NPCs and recovers neurons from stress caused by OGD. Thus, the neurogenic potential of QA can be explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling pain disorder that affects >1 billion people worldwide. One central hypothesis points to the cranial meninges as a key site underlying migraine headache genesis through complex interplay between meningeal sensory nerves, blood vessels, and adjacent immune cells. How these interactions might generate migraine headaches remains incompletely understood and a subject of much debate. In this review we discuss clinical and preclinical evidence supporting the concept that meningeal sterile inflammation, involving neurovascular and neuroimmune interactions, underlies migraine headache genesis. We examine downstream signaling pathways implicated in the development of migraine pain in response to exogenous events such as infusing migraine-triggering chemical substances. We further discuss cortex-to-meninges signaling pathways that could underlie migraine pain in response to endogenous events, such as cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), and explore future directions for the field.

                Antidepressant drugs promote neuronal plasticity, and activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its receptor neuronal receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (NTRK2 or TRKB) is among the critical steps in this process. These mechanisms are shared by typical slow-acting antidepressants, fast-acting ketamine, and psychedelic compounds, although the cellular targets of each drug differ. In this opinion, we propose that some of these antidepressants may directly bind to TRKB and allosterically potentiate BDNF signaling, among other possible effects. TRKB activation in parvalbumin-containing interneurons disinhibits cortical networks and reactivates a juvenile-like plasticity window. Subsequent rewiring of aberrant networks, coupled with environmental stimuli, may underlie its clinical antidepressant effects. The end-to-end hypothesis proposed may stimulate the search for new treatment strategies.

                The <i>Trp53</i> gene encodes several isoforms of elusive biological significance. Here, we show that mice lacking the <i>Trp53</i> alternatively spliced (AS) exon, thereby expressing the canonical p53 protein but not isoforms with the AS C-terminus, have unexpectedly lost a male-specific protection against Myc-induced B-cell lymphomas. Lymphomagenesis was delayed in <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> males compared to <i>Trp53<sup>ΔAS/ΔAS</sup> Eμ-Myc</i> males, but also compared to <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> and <i>Trp53<sup>ΔAS/ΔAS</sup> Eμ-Myc</i> females. Pre-tumoral splenic cells from <i>Trp53<sup>+/+</sup>Eμ-Myc</i> males exhibited a higher expression of <i>Ackr4,</i> encoding an atypical chemokine receptor with tumor suppressive effects. We identified <i>Ackr4</i> as a p53 target gene whose p53-mediated transactivation is inhibited by estrogens, and as a male-specific factor of good prognosis relevant for murine <i>Eμ-Myc</i>-induced and human Burkitt lymphomas. Furthermore, the knockout of <i>ACKR4</i> increased the chemokine-guided migration of Burkitt lymphoma cells. These data demonstrate the functional relevance of alternatively spliced p53 isoforms and reveal sex disparities in Myc-driven lymphomagenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92719">Exploring the role of macromolecular crowding and TNFR1 in cell volume control</a></h4>

              
                The excessive cosolute densities in the intracellular fluid create a physicochemical condition called macromolecular crowding (MMC). Intracellular MMC entropically maintains the biochemical thermodynamic equilibria by favouring associative reactions while hindering transport processes. Rapid cell volume shrinkage during extracellular hypertonicity elevates the MMC and disrupts the equilibria, potentially ushering cell death. Consequently, cells actively counter the hypertonic stress through regulatory volume increase (RVI) and restore the MMC homeostasis. Here, we establish fluorescence anisotropy of EGFP as a reliable tool for studying cellular MMC and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of MMC during cell volume instabilities under multiple conditions. Our studies reveal that the actin cytoskeleton enforces spatially varying MMC levels inside adhered cells. Within cell populations, MMC is uncorrelated with nuclear DNA content but anti-correlated with the cell spread area. Although different cell lines have statistically similar MMC distributions, their responses to extracellular hypertonicity vary. The intensity of the extracellular hypertonicity determines a cell's ability for RVI, which correlates with Nuclear Factor Kappa Beta (NFkB) activation. Pharmacological inhibition and knockdown experiments reveal that Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1) initiates the hypertonicity induced NFkB signalling and RVI. At severe hypertonicities, the elevated MMC amplifies cytoplasmic microviscosity and hinders Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (RIPK1) recruitment at the TNFR1 complex, incapacitating the TNFR1-NFkB signalling and consequently, RVI. Together, our studies unveil the involvement of TNFR1-NFkB signalling in modulating RVI and demonstrate the pivotal role of MMC in determining cellular osmoadaptability.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90692">Arpin deficiency increases actomyosin contractility and vascular permeability</a></h4>

              
                Arpin was discovered as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex localized at the lamellipodial tip of fibroblasts, where it regulated migration steering. Recently, we showed that arpin stabilizes the epithelial barrier in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. However, the expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells (EC) have not yet been described. Arpin mRNA and protein are expressed in EC and downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arpin depletion in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells causes the formation of actomyosin stress fibers leading to increased permeability in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Instead, inhibitors of ROCK1 and ZIPK, kinases involved in the generation of stress fibers, normalize the loss-of-arpin effects on actin filaments and permeability. Arpin-deficient mice are viable but show a characteristic vascular phenotype in the lung including edema, microhemorrhage, and vascular congestion, increased F-actin levels, and vascular permeability. Our data show that, apart from being an Arp2/3 inhibitor, arpin is also a regulator of actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86920">Two-way Dispatched function in Sonic hedgehog shedding and transfer to high-density lipoproteins</a></h4>

              
                The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway controls embryonic development and tissue homeostasis after birth. This requires regulated solubilization of dual-lipidated, firmly plasma membrane-associated Shh precursors from producing cells. Although it is firmly established that the resistance-nodulation-division transporter Dispatched (Disp) drives this process, it is less clear how lipidated Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane is achieved. We have previously shown that Disp promotes proteolytic solubilization of Shh from its lipidated terminal peptide anchors. This process, termed shedding, converts tightly membrane-associated hydrophobic Shh precursors into delipidated soluble proteins. We show here that Disp-mediated Shh shedding is modulated by a serum factor that we identify as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition to serving as a soluble sink for free membrane cholesterol, HDLs also accept the cholesterol-modified Shh peptide from Disp. The cholesteroylated Shh peptide is necessary and sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer because artificially cholesteroylated mCherry associates with HDL in a Disp-dependent manner, whereas an N-palmitoylated Shh variant lacking C-cholesterol does not. Disp-mediated Shh transfer to HDL is completed by proteolytic processing of the palmitoylated N-terminal membrane anchor. In contrast to dual-processed soluble Shh with moderate bioactivity, HDL-associated N-processed Shh is highly bioactive. We propose that the purpose of generating different soluble forms of Shh from the dual-lipidated precursor is to tune cellular responses in a tissue-type and time-specific manner.

                Hydrostatic pressure is a dominant environmental cue for vertically migrating marine organisms but the physiological mechanisms of responding to pressure changes remain unclear. Here, we uncovered the cellular and circuit bases of a barokinetic response in the planktonic larva of the marine annelid <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i>. Increased pressure induced a rapid, graded, and adapting upward swimming response due to the faster beating of cilia in the head multiciliary band. By calcium imaging, we found that brain ciliary photoreceptors showed a graded response to pressure changes. The photoreceptors in animals mutant for <i>ciliary opsin-1</i> had a smaller sensory compartment and mutant larvae showed diminished pressure responses. The ciliary photoreceptors synaptically connect to the head multiciliary band via serotonergic motoneurons. Genetic inhibition of the serotonergic cells blocked pressure-dependent increases in ciliary beating. We conclude that ciliary photoreceptors function as pressure sensors and activate ciliary beating through serotonergic signalling during barokinesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97673">Laminar specificity and coverage of viral-mediated gene expression restricted to GABAergic interneurons and their parvalbumin subclass in marmoset primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian neocortex, inhibition is important for dynamically balancing excitation and shaping the response properties of cells and circuits. The various computational functions of inhibition are thought to be mediated by different inhibitory neuron types, of which a large diversity exists in several species. Current understanding of the function and connectivity of distinct inhibitory neuron types has mainly derived from studies in transgenic mice. However, it is unknown whether knowledge gained from mouse studies applies to the non-human primate, the model system closest to humans. The lack of viral tools to selectively access inhibitory neuron types has been a major impediment to studying their function in the primate. Here, we have thoroughly validated and characterized several recently developed viral vectors designed to restrict transgene expression to GABAergic cells or their parvalbumin (PV) subtype, and identified two types that show high specificity and efficiency in marmoset V1. We show that in marmoset V1, AAV-h56D induces transgene expression in GABAergic cells with up to 91–94% specificity and 79% efficiency, but this depends on viral serotype and cortical layer. AAV-PHP.eB-S5E2 induces transgene expression in PV cells across all cortical layers with up to 98% specificity and 86–90% efficiency, depending on layer. Thus, these viral vectors are promising tools for studying GABA and PV cell function and connectivity in the primate cortex.

                -Synuclein (Syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) which are pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies. In the PD brain, with disease progression, LB/LN formation is propagated from the lower brainstem to the cerebral cortex. Prion-like cell-to-cell seed-transmission has been implicated as an underlying mechanism for Lewy-pathology propagation. However, the biochemical properties and production mechanism of those pathogenic seeds are unelucidated. In this study, we ascertained that the seeds released from pathological neurons that harbour LB/LN-like aggregates have the N-terminally truncated form of Syn. This N-terminal truncation is directly catalysed by SENP2, which is a well-known deSUMOylation enzyme. After SENP2 processing of recombinant Syn, the SDS-resistant high-molecular oligomer formation was promoted in vitro. Inhibition of SENP2 activity suppressed aggregate formation and propagation in cultured neurons and mouse brains. Thus, SENP2 might be a novel therapeutic target in LB diseases.

">Neural Encoding of Direction and Distance across Reference Frames in Visually Guided Reaching</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed actions require transforming sensory information into motor plans defined across multiple parameters and reference frames. Substantial evidence supports the encoding of target direction in gaze- and body-centered coordinates within parietal and premotor regions. However, how the brain encodes the equally critical parameter of target distance remains less understood. Here, using Bayesian pattern component modeling of fMRI data during a delayed reach-to-target task, we dissociated the neural encoding of both target direction and the relative distances between target, gaze, and hand at early and late stages of motor planning. This approach revealed independent representations of direction and distance along the human dorsomedial reach pathway. During early planning, most premotor and superior parietal areas encoded target distance in single or multiple reference frames and encoded direction. In contrast, distance encoding was magnified in gaze- and body-centric reference frames during late planning. These results emphasize a flexible and efficient human central nervous system that achieves goals by remapping sensory information related to multiple parameters, such as distance and direction, in the same brain areas.

">Sequestration of oxidative is necessary but not sufficient enough to conclude dopaminergic neuroprotective efficacy of curcumin: Insights from ALSS Drosophila Parkinson disease model</a></h4>

              
                Turmeric is a centuries-old ethnomedicine in Asia. Previously our laboratory demonstrated in the adult life stage-specific (ALSS) Drosophila model of Parkinson disease (PD) that Curcumin (K)-mediated dopaminergic (DAergic) neuroprotection is absent in the transition stage of adult life during which late-onset neurodegenerative disorders like PD sets-in, suggesting its limitation as a therapeutic agent. The present study demonstrates that K can sequester the enhanced levels of brain oxidative stress (OS) during both adult life phases i.e. health and transition stages but confers neuroprotection only during the health phase. However, literature reviews illustrate that efficacy of supposed therapeutic agents was asserted by their ability to sequester OS in only young PD animal models. In this context, it is important to point out that despite encouraging results in animal models, therapeutic efforts to target the general state of OS failed to retard PD progression. To understand this paradigm, we further investigated ALSS regulation of molecular players in the brain of the ALSS fly PD model and discovered that K-mediated differential modulation of adaptive stress response through dFOXO contributes to health phase-specific neuroprotection. These observations suggest that apart from the study of OS markers; it is essential to understand the ALSS regulation of molecular players. The synergistic influence of OS and the ALSS dysfunctional molecular networks could be responsible for the DAergic neurodegeneration in PD. The insights suggest that sequestration of OS by a therapeutic agent is necessary, but inadequate to conclude its neuroprotective efficacy and push it to the next phase of preclinical/clinical evaluation.

                The function of microglia during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be investigated using mouse models that enable genetic manipulation of microglial subpopulations in a temporal manner. We developed a mouse strain that expresses destabilized-domain Cre recombinase (DD-Cre) from the Cst7 locus (Cst7DD-Cre) and tested this in 5xFAD amyloidogenic, Ai14 tdTomato cre-reporter line mice. Dietary administration of trimethoprim to induce DD-Cre activity produces long-term labeling in disease associated microglia (DAM) without evidence of leakiness, with tdTomato-expression restricted to cells surrounding plaques. Using this model, we found that DAMs are a subset of plaque-associated microglia (PAMs) and their transition to DAM increases with age and disease stage. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed that tdTomato+ cells show higher expression of disease and inflammatory genes compared to other microglial populations, including non-labeled PAMs. This model should allow inducible cre-loxP targeting of DAMs, without leakiness.

                Daily rhythms in mosquito attraction to humans are thought to drive biting patterns and contribute to disease transmission dynamics. Behavioral rhythms in many insects are controlled by specialized clock cells in the brain that are coordinated by the neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF). We show that female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with genetically disrupted PDF display altered daily behavioral timing with reduced locomotor activity and biting in the morning. Using an automated behavioral tracking system, we also report that mosquitoes exhibit daily modulation of response persistence to the host cue carbon dioxide and loss of PDF alters this pattern. These findings indicate that PDF regulates temporal features of host-seeking behavior that promote biting success at specific times of day and may underlie blood feeding patterns observed in the field.

">Neuronal synchronization in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Rhythms are intrinsic to biological processes across temporal and spatial scales. In the brain, the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons creates collective rhythms that are essential for complex functions. While this is a recognized phenomenon in the mammalian brain, information about insect neuronal synchrony and its underlying mechanisms is scarce. In the fly brain, neuronal oscillations were reported in individual lateral ventral neurons (LNvs), which play a key role in circadian and sleep behaviors. However, it is still unclear whether and how these participate in a collective rhythm. In this work, we perform thorough whole-cell patch clamp recordings of LNvs, and demonstrate consistent membrane potential oscillations. We show that oscillations degrade over time, and disappear upon exposure to an acetylcholine receptor blocker. Together with a flat phase response curve, these results suggest that oscillations are exogenously produced. Prompted by these results, we propose a generic forced oscillator theory that can account for the experimental phase response. The theory further predicts that neurons with similar properties should oscillate in synchrony with zero lags, while neurons with different properties may show coherent oscillations with non-zero lags. We confirm this prediction through simultaneous patch clamp recordings of neuronal pairs, revealing that large LNvs are consistently advanced relative to small LNvs. Additionally, we find that other neurons in the accessory medulla also exhibit coherent membrane potential oscillations, with diverse lags. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that brain waves may arise from collective neuronal activity within this region of the fly brain.

                Functional MRI (fMRI) is an important tool for investigating functional networks. However, the widely used fMRI with T2*-weighted imaging in rodents has the problem of signal lack in the lateral ventral area of forebrain including the amygdala, which is essential for not only emotion but also noxious pain. Here, we scouted the zero-echo time (ZTE) sequence, which is robust to magnetic susceptibility and motion-derived artifacts, to image activation in the whole brain including the amygdala following the noxious stimulation to the hind paw. ZTE exhibited higher spatial and temporal signal-to-noise ratios than conventional fMRI sequences. Electrical sensory stimulation of the hind paw evoked ZTE signal increase in the primary somatosensory cortex. Formalin injection into the hind paw evoked early and latent change of ZTE signals throughout the whole brain including the subregions of amygdala. Furthermore, resting-state fMRI using ZTE demonstrated the functional connectivity, including that of the amygdala. These results indicate the feasibility of ZTE for whole brain fMRI, including the amygdala and we first show acute and latent activity in different subnuclei of the amygdala complex after nociceptive stimulation.

">Comparative study of pre- and post-mortem perfusion of fixative for the quality of neuronal tissue preparation</a></h4>

              
                Transcardiac perfusion of fixative agent is generally recommended for quality preparations for cerebral histology, ensuring rapid and deep penetration in the tissue to preserve the most fragile brain structures. Despite being performed under anesthesia and with proper analgesia, this procedure is cumbersome for the experimenter and raises ethical questions. Recently, alternative protocols have been proposed, based on prior sacrifice of the animal followed by an injection of a fixative agent into the circulation. These so-called post-mortem perfusion protocols should in theory ensure an equivalent quality of tissue fixation, without exposing live animals to a procedure. Before adopting this new method, it is necessary to validate that sample quality is equivalent, ensuring the validity of scientific results. We performed a parallel comparison of several protocols of tissue fixation, by transcardiac or post-mortem perfusion, and measured the impact on the maintenance of axonal structures, dendritic spines, and mitochondrial morphology. Our results showed that histological parameters show variable sensitivity to perfusion condition and fixative used. For instance, axon fragmentation and altered mitochondrial morphology were observed in post-mortem perfusion groups. We furthermore determined that fixation condition had a variable effect on immunostaining, impacting detected expression level or pattern. Our results serve as a guide to orient the experimenter in selecting the best condition for optimal tissue fixation, which minimizes animal suffering while guaranteeing the integrity of the biological results obtained.

">Is there a ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif of local field potential power across primate neocortex?</a></h4>

              
                Mendoza-Halliday, Major et al. 2024 ("The Paper") advocates a local field potential (LFP)-based approach to functional identification of cortical layers during "laminar" (simultaneous recordings from all cortical layers) multielectrode recordings in nonhuman primates (NHPs). The Paper describes a "ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif" in the primate neocortex: 1) 75-150 Hz power peaks in the supragranular layers, 2) 10-19 Hz power peaks in the infragranular layers and 3) the crossing point of their laminar power gradients identifies layer 4 (L4). Identification of L4 is critical in general, but especially for The Paper as the "motif" discovery is couched within a framework whose central hypothesis is that gamma activity originates in the supragranular layers and reflects feedforward activity, while alpha-beta activity originates in the infragranular layers and reflects feedback activity. In an impressive scientific effort, The Paper analyzed laminar data from 14 cortical areas in 2 prior macaque studies and compared them to marmoset, mouse and human data to further bolster the canonical nature of the motif. Identification of such canonical principles of brain operation is clearly a topic of broad scientific interest. Similarly, a reliable online method for L4 identification would be of broad scientific value for the rapidly increasing use of laminar recordings using numerous evolving technologies. Despite The Paper's strengths, and its potential for scientific impact, a series of concerns that are fundamental to the analysis and interpretation of laminar activity profile data in general, and local field potential (LFP) signals in particular, led us to question its conclusions. We thus evaluated the generality of The Paper's methods and findings using new sets of data comprised of stimulus-evoked laminar response profiles from primary and higher-order auditory cortices (A1 and belt cortex), and primary visual cortex (V1). The rationale for using these areas as a test bed for new methods is that their laminar anatomy and physiology have already been extensively characterized by prior studies, and there is general agreement across laboratories on key matters like L4 identification. Our analyses indicate that The Paper's findings do to generalize well to any of these cortical areas. In particular, we find The Paper's methods for L4 identification to be unreliable. Moreover, both methodological and statistical concerns, outlined below and in the supplement, question the stated prevalence of the motif in The Paper's published dataset. After summarizing our findings and related broader concerns, we briefly critique the evidence from biophysical modeling studies cited to support The Paper's conclusions. While our findings are at odds with the proposition of a ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif in the primate neocortex, The Paper already has, and will continue to spark debate and further experimentation. Hopefully this countervailing presentation will lead to robust collegial efforts to define optimal strategies for applying laminar recording methods in future studies.

">Brain plasticity for visual words: Elementary school teachers can drive changes in weeks that rival those formed over years</a></h4>

              
                This study aims to investigate the impact of vocabulary acquisition through short-term classroom learning and its relation to broader forms of vocabulary learning through long-term exposure in daily life. Through a two week of "learning sprint" in collaboration with a local elementary school and EEG-Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (EEG SSVEP) paradigm, we assessed new vocabulary learning in first and second graders within their pedagogical environment. We then compared the results with the word frequency effect, a well-established phenonmenon that reflects long-term vocabulary learning. After two weeks of classroom instruction, newly acquired words elicited neural responses similar to those of high-frequency words, with the effect significantly correlated with children's phonological decoding skills. Additionally, we successfully replicated the word frequency effect using the SSVEP paradigm for the first time. These findings highlight the potential of the "learning sprint" model for conducting neuroscience research in authentic educational settings, thereby fostering a stronger connection between education and neuroscience.

">Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Motor rehabilitation is a therapeutic process to facilitate functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its efficacy is limited to areas with remaining sensorimotor function. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) creates a temporary prosthetic effect that may allow further rehabilitation-induced recovery in individuals without remaining sensorimotor function, thereby extending the therapeutic reach of motor rehabilitation to individuals with more severe injuries. In this work, we report our first steps in developing a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS). The objective of this study was to identify EEG-based neural correlates of lower limb movement in the sensorimotor cortex of unimpaired individuals and to quantify the performance of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder in detecting movement onset from these neural correlates. Our results show that initiation of knee extension was associated with event-related desynchronization in the central-medial cortical regions at frequency bands between 4-44 Hz. Our neural decoder using  (8-12 Hz), low {beta} (16-20 Hz), and high {beta} (24-28 Hz) frequency bands achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 {+/-} 0.06 s.d. (n = 7) during a cued movement task offline. Generalization to imagery and uncued movement tasks served as positive controls to verify robustness against movement artifacts and cue-related confounds, respectively. With the addition of real-time decoder-modulated tSCS, the neural decoder performed with an average AUC of 0.81 {+/-} 0.05 s.d. (n = 9) on cued movement and 0.68 {+/-} 0.12 s.d. (n = 9) on uncued movement. Our results suggest that the decrease in decoder performance in uncued movement may be due to differences in underlying cortical strategies between conditions. Furthermore, we explore alternative applications of the BSI system by testing neural decoders trained on uncued movement and imagery tasks. By developing a non-invasive BSI, tSCS can be timed to be delivered only during voluntary effort, which may have implications for improving rehabilitation.

">Dopamine release in striatal striosome compartments in response to rewards and aversive outcomes during classical conditioning in mice</a></h4>

              
                The striatum consists of two anatomically and neurochemically distinct compartments, striosomes and the matrix, which receive dopaminergic inputs from the midbrain and exhibit distinct dopamine release dynamics in acute brain slices. Striosomes comprise approximately 15% of the striatum by volume and are distributed mosaically. Therefore, it is difficult to selectively record dopamine dynamics in striosomes using traditional neurochemical measurements in behaving animals, and it is unclear whether distinct dynamics play a role in associative learning. In this study, we used transgenic mice selectively expressing Cre in striosomal neurons, combined with a fiber photometry technique, to selectively record dopamine release in striosomes during classical conditioning. Water-restricted mice could distinguish the conditioned stimulus (CS) associated with saccharin water from the air-puff-associated CS. The air-puff-associated CS evoked phasic dopamine release only in striosomes. Furthermore, air puff presentation induced dopamine release to striosomal neurons but suppressed release to putative matrix neurons. These findings suggest that dopamine is released in a differential manner in striosomes and the matrix in behaving animals and that dopamine release in striosomes is preferentially induced by the air-puff-associated CS and air puff presentation. These findings support the hypothesis that striosomal neurons play a dominant role in aversive stimuli prediction.

">Microglia replacement by ER-Hoxb8 conditionally immortalized macrophages provides insight into Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome neuropathology</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the brains resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed "microglia replacement." To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this systems power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.

">Unsupervised alignment reveals structural commonalities and differences in neural representations of natural scenes across individuals and brain areas</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience research has extensively explored the commonality of neural representations of sensory stimuli across individuals to uncover universal neural mechanisms in the encoding of sensory information. To compare neural representations across different brains, Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) has been used, which focuses on the similarity structures of neural representations for different stimuli. Despite the broad applicability and utility of RSA, one limitation is that its conventional framework assumes that neural representations of particular stimuli correspond directly to those of the same stimuli in different brains. This assumption excludes the possibility that neural representations correspond differently and limits the exploration of finer structural similarities. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use an unsupervised alignment framework based on Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT) to compare similarity structures without presupposing stimulus correspondences. This method allows for the identification of optimal correspondence between neural representations of stimuli based solely on internal neural representation relationships, and thereby provides a more detailed comparison of neural similarity structures across individuals. We applied this unsupervised alignment to investigate the commonality of representational similarity structures of natural scenes, using large datasets of Neuropixels recordings in mice and fMRI recordings in humans. We found that the similarity structure of neural representations in the same visual cortical areas can be well aligned across individuals in an unsupervised manner in both mice and humans. In contrast, we found that the degree of alignment across different brain areas cannot be fully explained by proximity in the visual processing hierarchy alone, but also found some reasonable alignment results, such that the similarity structures of higher-order visual areas can be well aligned with each other but not with lower-order visual areas. We expect that our unsupervised approach will be useful for revealing more detailed structural commonalities or differences that may not be captured by the conventional supervised approach.

">Ocular hypertension impairs axonal transport in the optic nerve head leading to neurodegeneration in a novel Cre-inducible mouse model of myocilin glaucoma.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Degeneration of optic nerve (ON) axons and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the pathological hallmarks of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG). Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) due to dysfunction of trabecular meshwork (TM) is known to induce neurodegeneration. However, the early pathological events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration are poorly understood due to lack of robust and faithful mouse model that replicates all features of human POAG. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a novel Cre-inducible transgenic mouse model of myocilin (MYOC), the leading known genetic cause of POAG. Using this model, we further explore early pathological events of glaucomatous neurodegeneration due to chronic IOP elevation. Methods: We generated a Cre-inducible transgenic mouse model expressing DsRed-tagged Y437H mutant of human myocilin (Tg.CreMYOCY437H). A single intravitreal injection of helper adenovirus (HAd) 5 expressing empty cassette or Cre was performed in adult Tg.CreMYOCY437H mice, and glaucoma phenotypes including IOP, outflow facility, structural and functional loss of RGCs, ON degeneration, gliosis, and axonal transport deficits were examined at various stages of IOP elevation. Results: An intravitreal injection of HAd5-Cre led to selective MYOC expression in the TM at the level similar to endogenous Myoc. Expression of mutant MYOC induced biochemical and ultrastructural changes in TM leading to reduced outflow facility and significant IOP elevation. Notably, sustained IOP elevation led to significant functional and structural loss of RGCs and progressive ON degeneration. Glaucomatous neurodegeneration was associated with activation of astrocytes and neurodegenerative changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) region. Remarkably, chronic IOP elevation blocked anterograde axonal transport at the ONH prior to axonal degeneration and RGC loss. Interestingly, impaired axonal transport was associated with loss of cytoskeleton proteins including microtubules and neurofilaments resulting into accumulation of mitochondria in the ONH and neuronal dysfunction. Conclusions: Our studies indicate that Cre-inducible Tg.CreMYOCY437H mice recapitulates all glaucoma phenotypes observed in POAG patients. Importantly, sustained IOP elevation impairs axonal transport at ONH leading to glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

">Postnatal Development Of Dendritic Morphology And Action Potential Shape In Rat Substantia Nigra Dopaminergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons are characterized by specific morphological and electrophysiological properties. First, in ~90% of the cases, their axon arises from an axon-bearing dendrite (ABD) at highly variable distances from the soma. Second, they display a highly regular pattern of spontaneous activity (aka pacemaking) and a broad action potential (AP) that faithfully back-propagate through the entire dendritic arbor. In previous studies (Moubarak et al., 2019; Moubarak et al., 2022), we demonstrated that the presence of a high density of sodium current in the ABD and the complexity of this dendrite played a critical role in the robustness of pacemaking and setting the half-width of the AP. In the current study, we investigated the postnatal development of both morphology and AP shape in SNc DA neurons in order to determine when and how the mature electrophysiological phenotype of these neurons was achieved. To do so, we performed electrophysiological recordings of SNc DA neurons at 4 postnatal ages (P3, P7, P14, P21) and fully reconstructed their dendritic and proximal axon morphology. Our results show that several morphological parameters, including the length of the ABD, display abrupt changes between P7 and P14, such that a mature morphology is reached by P14. We then showed that AP shape followed a similar timecourse. Using realistic multicompartment Hodgkin-Huxley modeling, we then demonstrated that the rapid morpho-electrical maturation of SNc DA neurons likely arises from synergistic increases in dendritic length and in somatodendritic sodium channel density.

">Role of copper during microglial inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Copper plays crucial roles in various physiological functions of the nervous and immune systems. Dysregulation of copper homeostasis is linked to several diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Since dysfunctional microglial immunity can contribute to such diseases, we investigated the role of copper in microglial immunity. We found that both increased and decreased copper levels induced by chemical treatments suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation in microglial cells, as determined by RT-qPCR analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis confirmed that increased copper level reduces the inflammatory response to LPS; however, it also showed that decreased copper level affects genes involved in cell proliferation, transcription, and autophagosome regulation. These findings suggest that copper is vital for maintaining normal immune function in microglia, and both copper excess and deficiency can disrupt microglial immunity.

">Intra-hypothalamic circuit orchestrates β-endorphin release following coital ejaculation in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Survey-based evidence suggests that men experience a distinct post-ejaculation affective state1,2, marked by intense pleasure sometimes compared to the euphoric rush from intravenous injection of opioid drugs such as heroin3. However, the intrinsic neural circuit mechanisms underlying the ejaculation-triggered affective state remain unclear. Here, we discovered that Calbindin1-expressing (Calb1+) neurons in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus, an evolutionarily conserved regulatory region for male mating behavior4, are specifically activated during ejaculation in male mice. Inhibiting POA Calb1+ neurons prolongs mating and delays ejaculation. Importantly, POA Calb1+ neurons transmit the ejaculation signal and activate proopiomelanocortin-expressing (Pomc+) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which show robust and sustained activity lasting for tens of seconds, specifically upon ejaculation. This activity is accompanied by elevated levels of {beta}-endorphins5, opioid peptides secreted by Pomc+ neurons, post-ejaculation in male mice. Optogenetic activation of Pomc+ neurons increases {beta}-endorphins levels and conditioned placed preference, similar to ejaculation. Conversely, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of drugs blocking Pomc neuropeptides signaling eliminates ejaculation-conditioned place preference. Collectively, these results elucidate an intra-hypothalamic circuit from POA Calb1+ neurons to arcuate Pomc+ neurons that coordinate {beta}-endorphin release with ejaculation, shedding light on the neurobiological basis of the post-ejaculation affective state.

">Deleting PTEN, but not SOCS3 or myelin inhibitors, robustly boosts BRAF-elicited intraspinal regeneration of peripheral sensory axons</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory axons fail to regenerate into the spinal cord following dorsal root injury leading to permanent sensory deficits. Re-entry is prevented at the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), the CNS-PNS interface. Current approaches for promoting DR regeneration across the DREZ have had some success, but sustained, long-distance regeneration, particularly of large-diameter myelinated axons, still remains a formidable challenge. We have previously shown that induced expression of constitutively active B-RAF (kaBRAF) enhanced the regenerative competence of injured DRG neurons in adult mice. In this study, we investigated whether robust intraspinal regeneration can be achieved after a cervical DR injury by selective expression of kaBRAF alone or in combination with deletion of the myelin-associated inhibitors or neuron-intrinsic growth suppressors (PTEN or SOCS3). We found that kaBRAF promoted some axon regeneration across the DREZ but did not produce significant functional recovery by two months. Supplementary deletion of Nogo, MAG, and OMgp only modestly improved kaBRAF-induced regeneration. Deletion of PTEN or SOCS3 individually or in combination failed to promote any growth across the DREZ. In marked contrast, simultaneous deletion of PTEN, but not SOCS3, dramatically enhanced kaBRAF-mediated regeneration enabling many more axons to penetrate the DREZ and grow deep into the spinal cord. This study shows that dual activation of BRAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is an effective strategy to stimulate robust intraspinal DR regeneration.

">Speed modulations in grid cell information geometry</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells, known for their hexagonal spatial firing patterns, are widely regarded as essential to the brain's internal representation of the external space. Maintaining an accurate internal spatial representation is challenging when an animal is running at high speeds, as its self-location constantly changes. Previous studies of speed modulation of grid cells focused on individual or pairs of grid cells, yet neurons represent information via collective population activity. Population noise covariance can have significant impact on information coding that is impossible to infer from individual neuron analysis. To address this issue, we developed a novel Gaussian Process with Kernel Regression (GKR) method that allows study the simultaneously recorded neural population representation from an information geometry framework. We applied GKR to grid cell population activity, and found that running speed increases both grid cell activity toroidal-like manifold size and noise strength. Importantly, the effect of manifold dilation outpaces the effect of noise increasement, as indicated by the overall higher Fisher information at increasing speeds. This result is further supported by improved spatial information decoding accuracy at high speeds. Finally, we showed that the existence of noise covariance is information detrimental because it causes more noise projected onto the manifold surface. In total, our results indicate that grid cell spatial coding improves with increasing running speed. GKR provides a useful tool to understand neural population coding from an intuitive information geometric perspective.

">Flexible Adjustment of Oxytocin Neuron Activity in Mother Mice Revealed by Microendoscopy</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (OT) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH) play an important role in a range of physiological and behavioral processes, including the initiation of milk ejection and the regulation of parental behaviors in mothers. However, their activity patterns at the single-cell level remain poorly understood. Using microendoscopic Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mother mice, we demonstrate highly correlated pulsatile activity among individual OT neurons during lactation. The number of OT neurons engaged in the pulsatile activity, along with the characteristics of individual waveforms, was dynamically modulated by lactation and weaning experiences. Notably, only approximately 10% of the imaged OT neurons exhibited a significantly elevated response during pup retrieval, a hallmark of maternal behaviors, with a magnitude 18 times smaller than that observed during lactation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of microendoscopic imaging for PVH OT neurons and highlight the flexible adjustments of their individual activity patterns in freely behaving mother mice.

">Optical Neuroimage Studio (OptiNiSt): intuitive, scalable, extendable framework for optical neuroimage data analysis</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in calcium indicators and optical techniques have made optical neural recording a common tool in neuroscience. As the volume of optical neural recording data grows, streamlining the data analysis pipelines for image preprocessing, signal extraction, and subsequent neural activity analyses becomes essential. There are a number of challenges in optical neural data analysis. 1) The quality of original and processed data needs to be carefully examined at each step. 2) As there are numerous image preprocessing, cell extraction, and activity analysis algorithms, each with pros and cons, experimenters need to implement or install them to compare and select optimal methods and parameters for each step of processing. 3) To ensure the reproducibility of the research, each analysis step needs to be recorded in a systematic way. 4) For data sharing and meta-analyses, adoption of standard data formats and processing protocols is required. To address these challenges, we developed Optical Neuroimage Studio (OptiNiSt) (https://github.com/oist/optinist), a framework for intuitively creating calcium data analysis pipelines that are scalable, extendable, and reproducible. OptiNiSt includes the following features. 1) Researchers can easily create analysis pipelines by selecting multiple processing modules, tuning their parameters, and visualizing the results at each step through a graphic user interface in a web browser. 2) In addition to common analytical tools that are pre-installed, new analysis algorithms in Python can be easily added. 3) Once a processing pipeline is designed, the entire workflow with its modules and parameters are stored in a YAML file, which makes the pipeline reproducible and deployable on high-performance computing clusters. 4) OptiNiSt can read image data in a variety of file formats and store the analysis results in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders), a standard data format for data sharing. We expect that this framework will be helpful in standardizing optical neural data analysis protocols.

">Alpha-synuclein preformed fibril-induced aggregation and dopaminergic cell death in cathepsin D overexpression and ZKSCAN3 knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                alpha-synuclein accumulation is recognized as a prominent feature in the majority of Parkinson disease cases and also occurs in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease. It has been shown that alpha-synuclein can spread from a donor cell to neighboring cells and thus propagate cellular damage, antagonizing the effectiveness of therapies such as transplantation of fetal or iPSC derived dopaminergic cells. As we and others previously have shown, insufficient lysosomal function due to genetic mutations or targeted disruption of cathepsin D can cause alpha-synuclein accumulation. We here investigated whether overexpression of cathepsin D or knockout (KO) of the transcriptional suppressor of lysosomal biogenesis ZKSCAN3 can attenuate propagation of alpha-synuclein aggregation and cell death. We examined dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra using stereology of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells 4 months and 6 months after intrastriatal injection of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils or monomeric alpha-synuclein control in control, central nervous system (CNS)-cathepsin D overexpressing and CNS-specific ZKSCAN3 KO mice. We also examined pS129-alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra, cortex, amygdala and striatum. The extent of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and pS129-alpha-synuclein aggregation in the brains of CNS-specific ZKSCAN3 knockout mice and CNS-cathepsin D overexpressing mice was similar to that observed in wild-type mice. Our results indicate that neither enhancing cathepsin D expression nor disrupting ZKSCAN3 in the CNS is sufficient to attenuate pS129-alpha-synuclein aggregate accumulation or dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

                Brain Microphysiological Systems including neural organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells offer a unique lens to study the intricate workings of the human brain. This paper investigates the foundational elements of learning and memory in neural organoids, also known as Organoid Intelligence by quantifying immediate early gene expression, synaptic plasticity, neuronal network dynamics, and criticality to demonstrate the utility of these organoids in basic science research. Neural organoids showed synapse formation, glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor expression, immediate early gene expression basally and evoked, functional connectivity, criticality, and synaptic plasticity in response to theta-burst stimulation. In addition, pharmacological interventions on GABAergic and glutamatergic receptors, and input specific theta-burst stimulation further shed light on the capacity of neural organoids to mirror synaptic modulation and short-term potentiation, demonstrating their potential as tools for studying neurophysiological and neurological processes and informing therapeutic strategies for diseases.

                Background Virtual reality (VR) and immersive technologies offer benefits in anxiety reduction and mood enhancement. This study examines the effectiveness of rain stimuli and guided breathwork delivered through MindGym, a novel reflective chamber, and a traditional VR headset. Methods Physiological measures, cognitive, and trait and state assessments were collected for 126 participants, randomly assigned to VR (Breathwork), VR (Rain), MindGym (Breathwork), or MindGym (Rain) conditions. Results Significant improvements in cognitive performance, anxiety, and mood were observed across all groups, with an 11.67% reduction in anxiety (STAI). Breathwork conditions showed a greater decrease in breath rate compared to Rain. MODTAS, DPES, and Immersion positively moderated experiences of Awe and Ego Dissolution. Openness interacted with stimuli type, with higher openness associated with greater anxiety reduction in Breathwork conditions. No significant differences were found between MindGym and VR in effectiveness or immersion. Conclusions MindGym and VR demonstrated promise as acute anxiolytics, with MindGym-generated content maintaining effectiveness when translated to VR. This highlights MindGym's potential as a versatile content creation platform for immersive, anxiety-reducing experiences. Individual differences moderated treatment responses, suggesting opportunities for personalized interventions. Future research should explore complex MindGym experiences and adaptation to various delivery systems for accessible, effective anxiety management tools.

">Neural basis of collective social behavior during environmental challenge</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals have a remarkable capacity to collectively coordinate their behavior to respond to environmental challenges. However, the underlying neurobiology remains poorly understood. Here, we found that groups of mice self-organize into huddles at cold ambient temperature during the thermal challenge assay. We found that mice make active (self-initiated) and passive (partner-initiated) decisions to enter or exit a huddle. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging, we found that active and passive decisions are encoded distinctly within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Silencing dmPFC activity in some mice reduced their active decision-making, but also induced a compensatory increase in active decisions by non-manipulated partners, conserving the group's overall huddle time. These findings reveal how collective behavior is implemented in neurobiological mechanisms to meet homeostatic needs during environmental challenges.

">FUS controls muscle differentiation and structure through LLPS mediated recruitment of MEF2 and ETV5</a></h4>

              
                FUS is an RNA binding protein mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. We show that ALS-associated FUS mutations lead to ultrastructural defects in muscle of FUS-ALS patients, with disruption of sarcomeres and mitochondria. Studies in mouse and Drosophila models demonstrate an evolutionary-conserved cell autonomous function of FUS in muscle development. Mechanistically, FUS is required for transcription of MEF2 dependent genes, binds to the promoter of genes bound by ETS transcription factors in particular ETV5 and co-activates transcription of MEF2 dependent genes with ETV5. FUS phase separates with ETV5 and MEF2A, and MEF2A binding to FUS is potentiated by ETV5. Last, Etv5 haploinsufficiency exacerbates muscle weakness in a mouse model of FUS-ALS. These findings establish FUS as an essential protein for skeletal muscle structure through its phase separation-dependent recruitment of ETV5 and MEF2, defining a novel pathway compromised in FUS-ALS.

">The transcriptomic landscape of spinal V1 interneurons reveals a role for En1 in specific elements of motor output</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits in the spinal cord are composed of diverse sets of interneurons that play crucial roles in shaping motor output. Despite progress in revealing the cellular architecture of the spinal cord, the extent of cell type heterogeneity within interneuron populations remains unclear. Here, we present a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of spinal V1 interneurons across postnatal development. We find that the core molecular taxonomy distinguishing neonatal V1 interneurons perdures into adulthood, suggesting conservation of function across development. Moreover, we identify a key role for En1, a transcription factor that marks the V1 population, in specifying one unique subset of V1-Pou6f2 interneurons. Loss of En1 selectively disrupts the frequency of rhythmic locomotor output but does not disrupt flexion/extension limb movement. Beyond serving as a molecular resource for this neuronal population, our study highlights how deep neuronal profiling provides an entry point for functional studies of specialized cell types in motor output.

">Lateralized cerebellar connectivity differentiates auditory pathways in echolocating and non-echolocating whales</a></h4>

              
                We report the first application of diffusion tractography to a mysticete, which was analyzed alongside three odontocete brains, allowing the first direct comparison of strength and laterality of auditory pathways in echolocating and non-echolocating whales. Brains were imaged post-mortem at high resolution with a specialized steady state free precession diffusion sequence optimized for dead tissue. We conducted probabilistic tractography to compare the qualitative features, tract strength, and lateralization of potential ascending and descending auditory paths in the mysticete versus odontocetes. Tracts were seeded in the inferior colliculi (IC), a nexus for ascending auditory information, and the cerebellum, a center for sensorimotor integration. Direct IC to temporal lobe pathways were found in all animals, replicating previous cetacean tractography and suggesting conservation of the primary auditory projection path in the cetacean clade. Additionally, odontocete IC-cerebellum pathways exhibited higher overall tract strength than in the mysticete, suggesting a role as descending acousticomotor tracts supporting the rapid sensorimotor integration demands of echolocation. Further, in the mysticete, contralateral right IC to left cerebellum pathways were 17x stronger than those between left IC and right cerebellum, while in odontocetes, the laterality was reversed, and left IC to right cerebellum pathways were 2-4x stronger than those between right IC and left cerebellum. The stronger left IC-right cerebellum connectivity observed in odontocetes corroborates the theory that odontocetes preferentially echolocate with their right phonic lips, as the right phonic lips are likely innervated by left-cortical motor efferents that integrate with left-cortical auditory afferents in right cerebellum. This interpretation is further supported by the reversed lateralization of IC-cerebellar tracts observed in the non-echolocating mysticete. We also found differences in the specific subregions of cerebellum targeted by the IC, both between the mysticete and odontocetes, and between left and right sides. This study establishes foundational knowledge on mysticete auditory connectivity and extends knowledge on the neural basis of echolocation in odontocetes.

">The mechanism and consequences of amyloid-β modulating thiamine pyrophosphokinase-1 expression in microglia</a></h4>

              
                Ample studies attribute cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease to amyloid-{beta} deposition 1-6. However, brain amyloid-{beta} accumulation that saturates years before the manifestation of clinical symptoms is dissociated with cognitive decline of the disease 7. It is unknown how these two processes are mechanistically linked. In this and our accompanied study, we report that thiamine pyrophosphokinase-1 (TPK) deficiency plays essential roles in both processes via distinct mechanisms. Here we describe that diminished microglia Tpk controls the propagation of amyloid-{beta} plaques. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, microglia showed elevated Tpk expression at 2-month-old, but reduction in a plaque-centric manner at 8-month-old. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide, but not amyloid-{beta}, induceed Tpk reduction in cultured microglia. Tpk reduction led to microglia dysfunction, showing volatile motility but reduced phagocytosis and weak response to focal tissue injury, with accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets and abnormal mitochrondria. In Alzheimer's disease mice, microglia-specific knockout of Tpk caused diminished plaque coverage, exacerbated plaque burden and synaptic loss. However, increased plaques were not accompanied by the development of neurofibrillary tangles or brain atrophy, in contrast to the phenotype described in our accompanied paper with neuronal Tpk deletion. In conclusion, plaque-induced inflammation reduces Tpk in microglia, selectively exacerbating the spread of amyloid pathology.

	<p>Background: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a prevalent and potentially preventable secondary headache disorder linked to the excessive use of medications intended for primary headache management, particularly migraine. Aim: The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of MOH among undergraduate students and explore their awareness. Methodology: This observational cross-sectional study included 401 active undergraduate students from the University of Belgrade. Data were collected through an anonymous online questionnaire which was distributed among student groups and via social media. The questionnaire specially designed for this study was developed in accordance with established guidelines for headache epidemiological research. Results: Among the surveyed students, 10 of them (2.5%) met the criteria for the diagnosis of MOH. Awareness of MOH was noted in 149 (37.2%) students, with higher awareness among medical students and those aged 22&amp;amp;ndash;25 years. Despite this awareness, there was no significant difference in MOH occurrence between those aware and unaware of the condition (aware 2.7% vs. unaware 2.4%, p = 1.000). Additionally, significant gaps in education and communication about MOH were evident. Limitations: Participants were recruited through convenience sampling from a single university at one time point. The questionnaire was not specifically validated in the student population, and the data relied on self-reporting. Conclusions: Our study highlighted a notable prevalence of MOH among undergraduate students, with a substantial portion exhibiting awareness of its risks. Despite this awareness, our findings suggest ongoing gaps in education and communication regarding MOH, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Background: This scoping review had as a primary goal a review of the literature and the an analysis of the possible effectiveness of the LSVT LOUD approach in children with voice and speech deficits. Methods: A search was conducted in the Scopus and PubMed databases in May of 2024. Eleven articles were obtained from the search. The standards of PRISMA recommendations were used for scoping reviews and the PCC framework was used for the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the study used the instructions in the Cochrane Handbook for a quality assessment. The Mendeley Reference Manager software collected the studies and removed duplicates. Results: The reviewed studies employed formal and informal measures to assess voice and speech abilities in the children. Regarding the sample&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics, the studies mostly included children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and also those with Down Syndrome (DS). All the studies reported that children with CP and DS undertook a total dose of the LSVT LOUD treatment. Significant post-treatment findings indicated increased speech function and sound pressure level, regarding the auditory&amp;amp;ndash;perceptual ratings of voice and speech improvement. In many studies, parents&amp;amp;rsquo; and expert listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; ratings of voice, perception of vocal loudness, speech, and communication indicated improvement. Conclusions: The majority of the included studies provide positive evidence for the LSVT as an approach. However, the small sample size that featured in the studies, as well as their limitations, made these conclusions uncertain. Moreover, the study&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings provided recommendations that speech language therapists and other clinicians need to follow when setting a treatment plan with children with CP and DS.</p>

	<p>Exposure to physical and psychological stress modulates pain transmission in a dual manner. Stress-induced analgesia (SIA) refers to the reduction in pain sensitivity that can occur in response to acute stress. On the contrary, chronic stress exposure may lead to a phenomenon named stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH). SIH is a clinically relevant phenomenon since it has been well documented that physical and psychological stress exacerbates pain in patients with several chronic pain syndromes, including migraine. The availability of animal models of SIA and SIH is of high importance for understanding the biological mechanisms leading to these phenomena and for the identification of pharmacological targets useful to alleviate the burden of stress-exacerbated chronic pain. Among these targets, the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ)&amp;amp;ndash;N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor system has been identified as a key modulator of both pain transmission and stress susceptibility. This review describes first the experimental approaches to induce SIA and SIH in rodents. The second part of the manuscript summarizes the scientific evidence that suggests the N/OFQ&amp;amp;ndash;NOP receptor system as a player in the stress&amp;amp;ndash;pain interaction and candidates NOP antagonists as useful drugs to mitigate the detrimental effects of stress exposure on pain perception.</p>

	<p>Background: Multilayer networks have been used to identify abnormal dynamic reconfiguration in bipolar disorder (BD). However, these studies ignore the differences in information interactions between adjacent layers when constructing multilayer networks, and the analysis of dynamic reconfiguration is not comprehensive enough; Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 46 BD patients and 54 normal controls. A multilayer temporal network was constructed for each subject, and inter-layer coupling of different nodes was considered using network similarity. The promiscuity, recruitment, and integration coefficients were calculated to quantify the different dynamic reconfigurations between the two groups; Results: The global inter-layer coupling, recruitment, and integration coefficients were significantly lower in BD patients. These results were further observed in the attention network and the limbic/paralimbic and subcortical network, reflecting reduced temporal stability, intra- and inter-subnetwork communication abilities in BD patients. The whole-brain promiscuity was increased in BD patients. The same results were observed in the somatosensory/motor and auditory network, reflecting more functional interactions; Conclusions: This study discovered abnormal dynamic interactions of BD from the perspective of dynamic reconfiguration, which can help to understand the pathological mechanisms of BD.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysms represent up to 1% of all cerebral aneurysms. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are thought to be even less prevalent and often require complex treatment strategies due to their anatomical and morphological characteristics, with risk of a perforator infarct. We studied the treatment of P1-P2 perforator aneurysms in a single-center cohort from a high-volume tertiary center, reporting clinical and anatomical characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult patients with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm who presented at our institution between January 2000 and January 2023 was performed. The patients were analyzed for demographics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment techniques, outcomes, and complications. Subgroup analyses between ruptured versus non-ruptured cases were included. Results: Out of 2733 patients with a cerebral aneurysm, 14 patients (0.5%) presented with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm. All six patients with a ruptured aneurysm were treated by endovascular coiling, of whom one patient (16.7%) required surgical clipping of a recurrence. One out of eight (12.5%) patients with unruptured aneurysms was treated by surgical clipping. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms predominantly affected middle-aged individuals (median 59.5 years), with 10/14 (71.4%) being female. Endovascular coiling was the primary treatment modality overall, yielding favorable technical outcomes, however, it was complicated by a perforator infarct in two patients (33.3%) without new permanent morbidity or mortality secondary to treatment. Conclusions: P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are a rare subtype of intracranial aneurysm. Endovascular coiling could present an effective treatment modality; however, care should be taken for ischemic complications in the dependent perforator territory. Larger studies are required to provide more insights.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e0036242024?rss=1">Disentangling Temporal and Rate Codes in the Primate Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millisecond-scale temporal spiking patterns encode sensory information in the periphery, but their role in the neocortex remains controversial. The sense of touch provides a window into temporal coding because tactile neurons often exhibit precise, repeatable, and informative temporal spiking patterns. In the somatosensory cortex (S1), responses to skin vibrations exhibit phase locking that faithfully carries information about vibratory frequency. However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency shapes both the timing and rates of responses. To disentangle the contributions of these two neural features, we measured S1 responses as rhesus macaques performed frequency discrimination tasks in which differences in frequency were accompanied by orthogonal variations in amplitude. We assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of responses could account for animal performance. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by amplitude variations. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavioral biases, calling into question a rate-based neural code for frequency. In contrast, timing-based representations are highly informative about frequency but impervious to changes in amplitude, which is also inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavior. We account for the animals&rsquo; behavior with a model wherein frequency coding relies on a temporal code, but frequency judgments are biased by perceived magnitude. We conclude that information about vibratory frequency is not encoded in S1 firing rates but primarily in temporal patterning on millisecond timescales.</p>

                <p>Navigation requires integrating sensory information with a stable schema to create a dynamic map of an animal&rsquo;s position using egocentric and allocentric coordinate systems. In the hippocampus, place cells encode allocentric space, but their firing rates may also exhibit directional tuning within egocentric or allocentric reference frames. We compared experimental and simulated data to assess the prevalence of tuning to egocentric bearing (EB) among hippocampal cells in rats foraging in an open field. Using established procedures, we confirmed egocentric modulation of place cell activity in recorded data; however, simulated data revealed a high false-positive rate (FPR). When we accounted for false positives by comparing with shuffled data that retain correlations between the animal&rsquo;s direction and position, only a very low number of hippocampal neurons appeared modulated by EB. Our study highlights biases affecting FPRs and provides insights into the challenges of identifying egocentric modulation in hippocampal neurons.</p>

                <p>Attention and decision-making processes are fundamental to cognition. However, they are usually experimentally confounded, making it difficult to link neural observations to specific processes. Here we separated the effects of selective attention from the effects of decision-making on brain activity obtained from human participants (both sexes), using a two-stage task where the attended stimulus and decision were orthogonal and separated in time. Multivariate pattern analyses of multimodal neuroimaging data revealed the dynamics of perceptual and decision-related information coding through time with magnetoencephalography (MEG), through space with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and their combination (MEG-fMRI fusion). Our MEG results showed an effect of attention before decision-making could begin, and fMRI results showed an attention effect in early visual and frontoparietal regions. Model-based MEG-fMRI fusion suggested that attention boosted stimulus information in the frontoparietal and early visual regions before decision-making was possible. Together, our results suggest that attention affects neural stimulus representations in the frontoparietal regions independent of decision-making.</p>

                <p>Making choices about whether and when to engage cognitive effort are a common feature of everyday experience, with important consequences for academic, career, and health outcomes. Yet, despite their hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost&ndash;benefit decision-making. To investigate these mechanisms, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when this was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two decision-making task domains and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role of the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost&ndash;benefit decision-making.</p>

                <p>Neuroscience research has evolved to generate increasingly large and complex experimental data sets, and advanced data science tools are taking on central roles in neuroscience research. Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), a standard language for neurophysiology data, has recently emerged as a powerful solution for data management, analysis, and sharing. We here discuss our labs&rsquo; efforts to implement NWB data science pipelines. We describe general principles and specific use cases that illustrate successes, challenges, and non-trivial decisions in software engineering. We hope that our experience can provide guidance for the neuroscience community and help bridge the gap between experimental neuroscience and data science. Key takeaways from this article are that (1) standardization with NWB requires non-trivial design choices; (2) the general practice of standardization in the lab promotes data awareness and literacy, and improves transparency, rigor, and reproducibility in our science; (3) we offer several feature suggestions to ease the extensibility, publishing/sharing, and usability for NWB standard and users of NWB data.</p>

                <p>The frontal eye field (FEF) plays a well-established role in the control of visual attention. The strength of an FEF neuron's response to a visual stimulus presented in its receptive field is enhanced if the stimulus captures spatial attention by virtue of its salience. A stimulus can be rendered salient by cognitive factors as well as by physical attributes. These include surprise. The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether surprise-induced salience would result in enhanced visual-response strength in the FEF. Toward this end, we monitored neuronal activity in two male monkeys while presenting first a visual cue predicting with high probability that the reward delivered at the end of the trial would be good or bad (large or small) and then a visual cue announcing the size of the impending reward with certainty. The second cue usually confirmed but occasionally violated the expectation set up by the first cue. Neurons responded more strongly to the second cue when it violated than when it confirmed expectation. The increase in the firing rate was accompanied by a decrease in spike-count correlation as expected from capture of attention. Although both good surprise and bad surprise induced enhanced firing, the effects appeared to arise from distinct mechanisms as indicated by the fact that the bad-surprise signal appeared at a longer latency than the good-surprise signal and by the fact that the strength of the two signals varied independently across neurons.</p>

                <p>Circadian, infradian, and seasonal changes in steroid hormone secretion have been tied to changes in brain volume in several mammalian species. However, the relationship between circadian changes in steroid hormone production and rhythmic changes in brain morphology in humans is largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones and multiscale brain morphology in a precision imaging study of a male who completed 40 MRI and serological assessments at 7&nbsp;A.M. and 8&nbsp;P.M. over the course of a month, targeting hormone concentrations at their peak and nadir. Diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones were tied to pronounced changes in global and regional brain morphology. From morning to evening, total brain volume, gray matter volume, and cortical thickness decreased, coincident with decreases in steroid hormone concentrations (testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol). In parallel, cerebrospinal fluid and ventricle size increased from A.M. to P.M. Global changes were driven by decreases within the occipital and parietal cortices. These findings highlight natural rhythms in brain morphology that keep time with the diurnal ebb and flow of steroid hormones.</p>

                <p>The presence of valence coding neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that form distinct projections to other brain regions implies functional opposition between aversion and reward during learning. However, evidence for opponent interactions in fear learning is sparse and may only be apparent under certain conditions. Here we test this possibility by studying the roles of the BLA-&gt;central amygdala (CeA) and BLA-&gt;nucleus accumbens (Acb) pathways in fear learning in male rats. First, we assessed the organization of these pathways in the rat brain. BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways were largely segregated in the BLA but shared overlapping molecular profiles. Then we assessed activity of the BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways during two different forms of fear learning&mdash;fear learning in a neutral context and fear learning in a reward context. BLA-&gt;CeA neurons were robustly recruited by footshock regardless of where fear learning occurred, whereas recruitment of BLA-&gt;Acb neurons was state-dependent because footshock only recruited this pathway in a reward context. Finally, we assessed the causal roles of activity in these pathways in fear learning. Photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;CeA pathway during the footshock US impaired fear learning, regardless of where fear learning occurred. In contrast, photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway augmented fear learning, but only in the reward context. Taken together, our findings show circuit- and state-dependent opponent processing of fear. Footshock activity in the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway limits how much fear is learned.</p>

                <p>Ribbon synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) are uniquely designed for ultrafast and indefatigable neurotransmission of the sound. The molecular machinery ensuring the efficient, compensatory recycling of the synaptic vesicles (SVs), however, remains elusive. This study showed that hair cell knock-out of murine <I>Dmxl2</I>, whose human homolog is responsible for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss DFNA71, resulted in auditory synaptopathy by impairing synaptic endocytosis and recycling. The mutant mice in the C57BL/6J background of either sex had mild hearing loss with severely diminished wave I amplitude of the auditory brainstem response. Membrane capacitance measurements of the IHCs revealed deficiency in sustained synaptic exocytosis and endocytic membrane retrieval. Consistent with the electrophysiological findings, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction showed reduced reserve pool of SVs and endocytic compartments, while the membrane-proximal and ribbon-associated vesicles remain intact. Our results propose an important role of DMXL2 in hair cell endocytosis and recycling of the SVs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e2011222024?rss=1">Experience Dependence of Alpha Rhythms and Neural Dynamics in the Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of experience in the development and maintenance of emergent network properties such as cortical oscillations and states is poorly understood. To define how early-life experience affects cortical dynamics in the visual cortex of adult, head-fixed mice, we examined the effects of two forms of blindness initiated before eye opening and continuing through recording: (1) bilateral loss of retinal input (enucleation) and (2) degradation of visual input (eyelid suture). Neither form of deprivation fundamentally altered the state-dependent regulation of firing rates or local field potentials. However, each deprivation caused unique changes in network behavior. Laminar analysis revealed two different generative mechanisms for low-frequency synchronization: one prevalent during movement and the other during quiet wakefulness. The former was absent in enucleated mice, suggesting a mouse homolog of human alpha oscillations. In addition, neurons in enucleated animals were less correlated and fired more regularly, but no change in mean firing rate. Eyelid suture decreased firing rates during quiet wakefulness, but not during movement, with no effect on neural correlations or regularity. Sutured animals showed a broadband increase in depth EEG power and an increased occurrence, but reduced central frequency, of narrowband gamma oscillations. The complementary&mdash;rather than additive&mdash;effects of lid suture and enucleation suggest that the development of emergent network properties does not require vision but is plastic to modified input. Our results suggest a complex interaction of internal set points and experience determines mature cortical activity, with low-frequency synchronization being particularly susceptible to early deprivation.</p>

                <p>People parse continuous experiences at natural breakpoints called event boundaries, which is important for understanding an environment's causal structure and for responding to uncertainty within it. However, it remains unclear how different forms of uncertainty affect the parsing of continuous experiences and how such uncertainty influences the brain's processing of ongoing events. We exposed human participants of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 34) to a continuous sequence of semantically meaningless images. We generated sequences from random walks through a graph that grouped images into temporal communities. After learning, we asked participants to segment another sequence at natural breakpoints (event boundaries). Participants segmented the sequence at learned transitions between communities, as well as at novel transitions, suggesting that people can segment temporally extended experiences into events based on learned structure as well as prediction error. Greater segmentation at novel boundaries was associated with enhanced parietal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) activity between 250 and 450&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. Multivariate classification of EEG activity showed that novel and learned boundaries evoked distinct patterns of neural activity, particularly theta band power in posterior electrodes. Learning also led to distinct neural representations for stimuli within the temporal communities, while neural activity at learned boundary nodes showed predictive evidence for the adjacent community. The data show that people segment experiences at both learned and novel boundaries and suggest that learned event boundaries trigger retrieval of information about the upcoming community that could underlie anticipation of the next event in a sequence.</p>

                <p>Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) and sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) hallmarks of absence seizures and nonrapid eye movement sleep, respectively. They are commonly generated by the cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical network including the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). It has been reported that SWD development is accompanied by a decrease in sleep spindle density in absence seizure patients and animal models. However, whether the decrease in sleep spindle density precedes, coincides with, or follows, the SWD development remains unknown. To clarify this, we exploited <I>Pvalb</I>-tetracycline transactivator (tTA)::tetO-ArchT (PV-ArchT) double-transgenic mouse, which can induce an absence seizure phenotype in a time-controllable manner by expressing ArchT in PV neurons of the TRN. In these mice, EEG recordings demonstrated that a decrease in sleep spindle density occurred 1&nbsp;week before the onset of typical SWDs, with the expression of ArchT. To confirm such temporal relationship observed in these genetic model mice, we used a gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) pharmacological model of SWDs. Prior to GBL administration, we administered caffeine to wild-type mice for 3 consecutive days to induce a decrease in sleep spindle density. We then administered low-dose GBL, which cannot induce SWDs in normally conditioned mice but led to the occurrence of SWDs in caffeine-conditioned mice. These findings indicate a temporal relationship in which the decrease in sleep spindle density consistently precedes SWD development. Furthermore, the decrease in sleep spindle activity may have a role in facilitating the development of SWDs. Our findings suggest that sleep spindle reductions could serve as early indicators of seizure susceptibility.</p>

                <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a family of genetically heterogeneous diseases still without a cure. Despite the causative genetic mutation typically not expressed in cone photoreceptors, these cells inevitably degenerate following the primary death of rods, causing blindness. The reasons for the "bystander" degeneration of cones are presently unknown but decrement of survival factors, oxidative stress, and inflammation all play a role. Targeting these generalized biological processes represents a strategy to develop mutation-agnostic therapies for saving vision in large populations of RP individuals. A classical method to support neuronal survival is by employing neurotrophic factors, such as NGF. This study uses painless human NGF (hNGFp), a TrkA receptor-biased variant of the native molecule with lower affinity for nociceptors and limited activity as a pain inducer; the molecule has identical neurotrophic power of the native form but a reduced affinity for the p75NTR receptors, known to trigger apoptosis. hNGFp has a recognized activity on brain microglial cells, which are induced to a phenotype switch from a highly activated to a more homeostatic configuration. hNGFp was administered to RP-like mice in vivo with the aim of decreasing retinal inflammation and also providing retinal neuroprotection. However, the ability of this treatment to counteract the bystander degeneration of cones remained limited.</p>

Viruses of microbes are ubiquitous biological entities that reprogram their hosts’ metabolisms during infection in order to produce viral progeny, impacting the ecology and evolution of microbiomes with broad implications for human and environmental health. Advances in genome sequencing have led to the discovery of millions of novel viruses and an appreciation for the great diversity of viruses on Earth. Yet, with knowledge of only <i>“who is there</i>?<i>”</i> we fall short in our ability to infer the impacts of viruses on microbes at population, community, and ecosystem-scales. To do this, we need a more explicit understanding <i>“who do they infect</i>?<i>”</i> Here, we developed a novel machine learning model (ML), Virus-Host Interaction Predictor (VHIP), to predict virus-host interactions (infection/non-infection) from input virus and host genomes. This ML model was trained and tested on a high-value manually curated set of 8849 virus-host pairs and their corresponding sequence data. The resulting dataset, ‘Virus Host Range network’ (VHRnet), is core to VHIP functionality. Each data point that underlies the VHIP training and testing represents a lab-tested virus-host pair in VHRnet, from which meaningful signals of viral adaptation to host were computed from genomic sequences. VHIP departs from existing virus-host prediction models in its ability to predict multiple interactions rather than predicting a single most likely host or host clade. As a result, VHIP is able to infer the complexity of virus-host networks in natural systems. VHIP has an 87.8% accuracy rate at predicting interactions between virus-host pairs at the species level and can be applied to novel viral and host population genomes reconstructed from metagenomic datasets.

Malaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus <i>Plasmodium</i>. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBCs) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs begins with the invasion of RBCs by <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i>, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from 2 specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains 7 transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only 1 rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11-deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11-deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11-deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.

The modular structure of functional connectomes in the human brain undergoes substantial reorganization during development. However, previous studies have implicitly assumed that each region participates in one single module, ignoring the potential spatial overlap between modules. How the overlapping functional modules develop and whether this development is related to gray and white matter features remain unknown. Using longitudinal multimodal structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data from 305 children (aged 6 to 14 years), we investigated the maturation of overlapping modules of functional networks and further revealed their structural associations. An edge-centric network model was used to identify the overlapping modules, and the nodal overlap in module affiliations was quantified using the entropy measure. We showed a regionally heterogeneous spatial topography of the overlapping extent of brain nodes in module affiliations in children, with higher entropy (i.e., more module involvement) in the ventral attention, somatomotor, and subcortical regions and lower entropy (i.e., less module involvement) in the visual and default-mode regions. The overlapping modules developed in a linear, spatially dissociable manner, with decreased entropy (i.e., decreased module involvement) in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, and putamen and increased entropy (i.e., increased module involvement) in the parietal lobules and lateral prefrontal cortex. The overlapping modular patterns captured individual brain maturity as characterized by chronological age and were predicted by integrating gray matter morphology and white matter microstructural properties. Our findings highlight the maturation of overlapping functional modules and their structural substrates, thereby advancing our understanding of the principles of connectome development.

                Background: Physical therapy (PT) services can be essential for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Maintaining an efficient healthcare service is achieved by ensuring the safety of a well-informed healthcare practitioner. This study aimed to assess the sources of knowledge, attitude, experience, and accessibility to the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the physical therapists working in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to survey on-duty PT practitioners using a web-based questionnaire. Licensed PT practitioners were invited to participate, and a sample of 424 therapists responded. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions covering the demographic data and the following domains: sources of knowledge regarding the pandemic, experience, and attitude of the therapists during the pandemic, and accessibility to the PPE. Results: Around 83% of the participants (352) completed all the survey questions. Governmental websites were the most used source of knowledge (39%). Hand sanitization was implemented by the majority of participants (81%). Participants, mainly males and experienced therapist, were willing to treat COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 complications of prolonged ventilation and immobilization were successfully treated by 91.2% of participants who treated positive cases. About a third of the participants were part of COVID-19 management planning teams or received training to deal with the pandemic. Most of the necessary PPE was adequately accessible during the pandemic. Conclusions: Therapists implemented the recommended hygienic practices and had no problems accessing the necessary PPE. More efforts should target therapists’ education about the social media misleading information and involving the therapists in the pandemic management planning teams.

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple works had been done to study nonsynonymous mutations, which change protein sequences. However, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations, which may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Methods A total of 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database were aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified. Multiple RNA secondary structures prediction tools, namely RNAfold, IPknot++ and MXfold2 were applied to predict the effect of the mutations on RNA secondary structure and their base pair probabilities was estimated using MutaRNA. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a. Of these top 10 highest frequency synonymous mutations, C913U, C3037U, U16176C and C18877U mutants show pronounced changes between wild type and mutant in all 3 RNA secondary structure prediction tools, suggesting these mutations may have some biological impact on viral fitness. These four mutations show changes in base pair probabilities. All mutations except U16176C change the codon to a more preferred codon, which may result in higher translation efficiency. Conclusion Synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome may affect RNA secondary structure, changing base pair probabilities and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The cerebral cortex accounts for substantial energy expenditure, primarily driven by the metabolic demands of synaptic signaling. Mitochondria, the organelles responsible for generating cellular energy, play a crucial role in this process. We investigated ultrastructural characteristics of the primary visual cortex in 18 phylogenetically diverse mammals, spanning a broad range of brain sizes from mouse to elephant. Our findings reveal remarkable uniformity in synapse density, postsynaptic density (PSD) length, and mitochondria density, indicating functional and metabolic constraints that maintain these fundamental features. Notably, we observed an average of 1.9 mitochondria per synapse across mammalian species. When considered together with the trend of decreasing neuron density with larger brain size, we find that brain enlargement in mammals is characterized by increasing proportions of synapses and mitochondria per cortical neuron. These results shed light on the adaptive mechanisms and metabolic dynamics that govern cortical ultrastructure across mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1069/v1?src=rss">Simplification of clean development mechanism to measure CO2 emission reductions from shifting private transportation to mass rapid transit: a case study of MRT Jakarta Phase 1 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Indonesian government built the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Jakarta to reduce traffic congestion and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The objective of this study is to estimate the CO2 emissions reductions from switching from private transport to MRT by using a methodology proposed by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for developing countries, namely the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology, which generates Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). This methodology is more comprehensive than other available methodologies. However, this method has not been widely used to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in mass transit projects because it is complex enough to require a lot of data based on primary surveys. Therefore, this research simplifies the CDM formula to make it easier and applicable in Indonesia. Methods The primary data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to 480 MRT Jakarta Phase 1 user respondents in September 2019 (baseline); the secondary data were obtained from The MRT Jakarta. The data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. The simplified Clean Development Mechanism Approved Consolidated Methodology 0016 (CDM ACM 0016) was the analysis method used. Result The results of this study indicate that 53.75% of MRT Jakarta Phase 1 users are shifting from private transportation, which has reduced CO2 emissions by 2,732.7 tons in 2019 and 6,043.9 tons in 2023. Increasing the number of MRT passengers who switch from private transportation will further reduce CO2 emissions. Conclusion and implications The simplified CDM ACM 0016 formula may be suitable for use in Indonesia. This would enable the measurement of CO2 emission reductions through mitigation actions through MRT development to be certified by the UNFCCC. Applying this method in calculating CO2 emission reductions, implementing strategies to increase MRT passengers, and using renewable energy electricity sources would increase CO2 emission reductions.

                Introduction The emotional impact of patient loss in oncology and palliative care profoundly affects healthcare professionals. This study explores clinicians’ experiences, emotional reactions, and coping mechanisms in these fields, focusing on their professional and personal growth. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how healthcare professionals from different regions and with varying years of experience deal with patient loss, emphasizing cultural, social, and institutional influences on their coping strategies. Methods A mixed-methods approach combined qualitative and quantitative elements. Data were collected using a Microsoft® Forms© survey targeting oncology and palliative care healthcare professionals. The survey included questions on experiences with patient loss, coping strategies, personal and professional growth, and beliefs. Statistical methods and thematic analysis were used to analyse quantitative and qualitative data. Ethical approval was obtained, and the survey ensured participant anonymity and confidentiality. Results The survey received 125 responses from nineteen countries. Emotional reactions to patient loss were significant, with various coping strategies reported, including spiritual practices, self-care, and professional support groups. Personal and professional growth were key outcomes of dealing with patient loss. Themes like Emotional Impact, Coping Mechanisms, and Reflections on Death and Dying were prevalent. Analysis revealed no significant correlation between the time taken by the participants to complete the survey and years of healthcare experience. Conclusion Healthcare professionals in oncology and palliative care face significant emotional challenges due to patient loss. The study emphasizes the importance of diverse and effective coping mechanisms, the supportive role of personal beliefs and workplace environments, and the journey of personal and professional growth amidst these challenges. It highlights the resilience of healthcare workers and underscores the need for supportive systems in managing the emotional aspects of patient care.

                Sato et al. show that obesity-related phenotypes in sPLA2-X-deficient C57BL/6 mice result from gut microbiota alteration. Colonic sPLA2-X releases ω3 PUFAs, ameliorates colonic inflammation, increases specific Clostridium species that produce SCFAs, and protects against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Supplementation with ω3 PUFAs or SCFAs rescues the phenotypes caused by sPLA2-X deficiency.

                Casco et al. develop a dual-fluorescent lytic reporter Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for isolating lymphoblastoid cell lines during early or late lytic replication. Their RNA-sequencing analysis shows extensive transcriptome remodeling during EBV reactivation from latency. Knockout of the host shutoff factor, BGLF5, subtly affects global gene downregulation, suggesting that other mechanisms significantly contribute to host shutoff.

                Severin et al. describe time-of-day changes in membrane capacitance in excitatory neurons from the visual cortex and hippocampus. Membrane capacitance is usually stable. These daily variations could profoundly impact neuronal physiology because of capacitance’s influence on the membrane time constant. Consistent with this, the authors show strong changes in synaptic integration.

                Forero et al. highlight heterogeneity in the protein content of EVs secreted by neural cells and cerebral organoids. Their findings show that neural cells present different EV uptake mechanisms and that EV treatment exerts transcriptional changes and an increase in proliferation in NPCs.

                Pumilio RNA-binding proteins are developmentally downregulated in the brain. Randolph et al. report that the simultaneous downregulation of Pumilio 1 and 2 promotes synapse maturation and increases the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, the regulation of Pumilio protein levels represents a cell-intrinsic mechanism for the modulation of synapse maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94631">OVO positively regulates essential maternal pathways by binding near the transcriptional start sites in the Drosophila female germline</a></h4>

              
                Differentiation of female germline stem cells into a mature oocyte includes the expression of RNAs and proteins that drive early embryonic development in <i>Drosophila</i>. We have little insight into what activates the expression of these maternal factors. One candidate is the zinc-finger protein OVO. OVO is required for female germline viability and has been shown to positively regulate its own expression, as well as a downstream target, <i>ovarian tumor</i>, by binding to the transcriptional start site (TSS). To find additional OVO targets in the female germline and further elucidate OVO’s role in oocyte development, we performed ChIP-seq to determine genome-wide OVO occupancy, as well as RNA-seq comparing hypomorphic and wild type rescue <i>ovo</i> alleles. OVO preferentially binds in close proximity to target TSSs genome-wide, is associated with open chromatin, transcriptionally active histone marks, and OVO-dependent expression. Motif enrichment analysis on OVO ChIP peaks identified a 5’-TAACNGT-3’ OVO DNA binding motif spatially enriched near TSSs. However, the OVO DNA binding motif does not exhibit precise motif spacing relative to the TSS characteristic of RNA polymerase II complex binding core promoter elements. Integrated genomics analysis showed that 525 genes that are bound and increase in expression downstream of OVO are known to be essential maternally expressed genes. These include genes involved in anterior/posterior/germ plasm specification (<i>bcd, exu, swa, osk, nos, aub, pgc, gcl</i>), egg activation (<i>png, plu, gnu, wisp, C(3)g, mtrm</i>), translational regulation (<i>cup</i>, <i>orb</i>, <i>bru1, me31B</i>), and vitelline membrane formation (<i>fs(1)N</i>, <i>fs(1)M3</i>, <i>clos</i>). This suggests that OVO is a master transcriptional regulator of oocyte development and is responsible for the expression of structural components of the egg as well as maternally provided RNAs that are required for early embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88412">Ca2+ channel and active zone protein abundance intersects with input-specific synapse organization to shape functional synaptic diversity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic heterogeneity is a hallmark of nervous systems that enables complex and adaptable communication in neural circuits. To understand circuit function, it is thus critical to determine the factors that contribute to the functional diversity of synapses. We investigated the contributions of voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) abundance, spatial organization, and subunit composition to synapse diversity among and between synapses formed by two closely related <i>Drosophila</i> glutamatergic motor neurons with distinct neurotransmitter release probabilities (P<sub>r</sub>). Surprisingly, VGCC levels are highly predictive of heterogeneous P<sub>r</sub> among individual synapses of either low- or high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, but not between inputs. We find that the same number of VGCCs are more densely organized at high-P<sub>r</sub> synapses, consistent with tighter VGCC-synaptic vesicle coupling. We generated endogenously tagged lines to investigate VGCC subunits in vivo and found that the α2δ–3 subunit Straightjacket along with the CAST/ELKS active zone (AZ) protein Bruchpilot, both key regulators of VGCCs, are less abundant at high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, yet positively correlate with P<sub>r</sub> among synapses formed by either input. Consistently, both Straightjacket and Bruchpilot levels are dynamically increased across AZs of both inputs when neurotransmitter release is potentiated to maintain stable communication following glutamate receptor inhibition. Together, these findings suggest a model in which VGCC and AZ protein abundance intersects with input-specific spatial and molecular organization to shape the functional diversity of synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96790">The common Sting1 HAQ, AQ alleles rescue CD4 T cellpenia, restore T-regs, and prevent SAVI (N153S) inflammatory disease in mice</a></h4>

              
                The significance of <i>STING1</i> gene in tissue inflammation and cancer immunotherapy has been increasingly recognized. Intriguingly, common human <i>STING1</i> alleles R71H-G230A-R293Q (<i>HAQ</i>) and G230A-R293Q (<i>AQ</i>) are carried by ~60% of East Asians and ~40% of Africans, respectively. Here, we examine the modulatory effects of <i>HAQ, AQ</i> alleles on STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), an autosomal dominant, fatal inflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function human <i>STING1</i> mutations. CD4 T cellpenia is evident in SAVI patients and mouse models. Using <i>Sting1</i> knock-in mice expressing common human <i>STING1</i> alleles <i>HAQ</i>, <i>AQ</i>, and <i>Q293</i>, we found that <i>HAQ, AQ</i>, and <i>Q293</i> splenocytes resist STING1-mediated cell death ex vivo, establishing a critical role of STING1 residue 293 in cell death. The <i>HAQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) and <i>AQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice did not have CD4 T cellpenia. The <i>HAQ/SAVI(N153S), AQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice have more (~10-fold, ~20-fold, respectively) T-regs than <i>WT/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice. Remarkably, while they have comparable TBK1, IRF3, and NFκB activation as the <i>WT/SAVI</i>, the <i>AQ/SAVI</i> mice have no tissue inflammation, regular body weight, and normal lifespan. We propose that STING1 activation promotes tissue inflammation by depleting T-regs cells in vivo. Billions of modern humans have the dominant <i>HAQ, AQ</i> alleles. STING1 research and STING1-targeting immunotherapy should consider <i>STING1</i> heterogeneity in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97018">Does bumblebee preference of continuous over interrupted strings in string-pulling tasks indicate means-end comprehension?</a></h4>

              
                Bumblebees (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>) have been shown to engage in string-pulling behavior to access rewards. The objective of this study was to elucidate whether bumblebees display means-end comprehension in a string-pulling task. We presented bumblebees with two options: one where a string was connected to an artificial flower containing a reward and the other presenting an interrupted string. Bumblebees displayed a consistent preference for pulling connected strings over interrupted ones after training with a stepwise pulling technique. When exposed to novel string colors, bees continued to exhibit a bias towards pulling the connected string. This suggests that bumblebees engage in featural generalization of the visual display of the string connected to the flower in this task. If the view of the string connected to the flower was restricted during the training phase, the proportion of bumblebees choosing the connected strings significantly decreased. Similarly, when the bumblebees were confronted with coiled connected strings during the testing phase, they failed to identify and reject the interrupted strings. This finding underscores the significance of visual consistency in enabling the bumblebees to perform the task successfully. Our results suggest that bumblebees’ ability to distinguish between continuous strings and interrupted strings relies on a combination of image matching and associative learning, rather than means-end understanding. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes employed by bumblebees when tackling complex spatial tasks.
