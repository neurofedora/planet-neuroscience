              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identifying Inputs to Visual Projection Neurons in Drosophila Lobula by Analyzing Connectomic Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomes provide important insights into how visual circuitry of fruit fly <I>Drosophila</I> computes various visual features, guiding and complementing behavioral and physiological studies. However, connectomic analyses of the lobula, a neuropil putatively dedicated to detecting object-like features, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the <I>Drosophila</I> lobula neuropil by performing connectivity-based and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Subcortical Processing of Amplitude-Modulated Tones in Mice Deficient for Cacna2d3, a Risk Gene for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal processing of complex sounds is a fundamental and complex task in hearing and a prerequisite for processing and understanding vocalization, speech, and prosody. Here, we studied response properties of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in mice lacking <I>Cacna2d3</I>, a risk gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3 auxiliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit encoded by <I>Cacna2d3</I> is essential for proper function of glutamatergic synapses in the auditory brainstem. Recent evidence has shown that much of auditory feature extraction is performed in the auditory brainstem and IC, including processing of amplitude modulation (AM). We determined both spectral and temporal properties of single- and multi-unit responses in the IC of anesthetized mice. IC units of &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal tuning properties yet increased spontaneous rates compared with &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>+/+</sup>. When stimulated with AM tones, &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> units exhibited less precise temporal coding and reduced evoked rates to higher modulation frequencies (f<SUB>m</SUB>). Whereas first spike latencies (FSLs) were increased for only few modulation frequencies, population peak latencies were increased for f<SUB>m</SUB> ranging from 20 to 100 Hz in &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> IC units. The loss of precision of temporal coding with increasing f<SUB>m</SUB> from 70 to 160 Hz was characterized using a normalized offset-corrected (Pearson-like) correlation coefficient, which appeared more appropriate than the metrics of vector strength. The processing deficits of AM sounds analyzed at the level of the IC indicate that &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit a subcortical auditory processing disorder (APD). Similar deficits may be present in other mouse models for ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic {theta} Frequency Coordination within and between the Prefrontal Cortex-Hippocampus Circuit during Learning of a Spatial Avoidance Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>-Scale coordination of prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) local field potentials (LFPs) and its influence via direct or indirect projections to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHC) during spatial learning remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that  frequency coordination dynamics within and between the mPFC, dHC, and vHC would be predetermined by the level of connectivity rather than reflecting differing circuit throughput relationships depending on cognitive demands. Moreover, we hypothesized that coherence levels would not change during learning of a complex spatial avoidance task. Adult male rats were bilaterally implanted with EEG electrodes and LFPs recorded in each structure. Contrary to predictions,  coherence averaged across "Early" or "Late" training sessions in the mPFC-HC, mPFC-mPFC, and HC-HC increased as a function of task learning. Coherence levels were also highest between the indirectly connected mPFC-dHC circuit, particularly during early training. Although mPFC postacquisition coherence remained higher with dHC than vHC, dynamic mPFC coherence patterns with both hippocampal poles across avoidance epochs were similar. In the 3 s before avoidance, a regional temporal sequence of transitory coherence peaks emerged between the mPFC-mPFC, the mPFC-HC, and then dHC-dHC. During this sequence, coherence within  bandwidth fluctuated between epochs at distinct subfrequencies, suggesting frequency-specific roles for the propagation of task-relevant processing. On a second timescale, coherence frequency within and between the mPFC and hippocampal septotemporal axis change as a function of avoidance learning and cognitive demand. The results support a role for  coherence subbandwidths, and specifically an 8- to 9-Hz mPFC  signal, for generating and processing qualitatively different types of information in the organization of spatial avoidance behavior in the mPFC-HC circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Listening Zone of Human Electrocorticographic Field Potential Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings provide invaluable insights into neural dynamics in humans because of their unmatched spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed correlations between signals as a function of distance (full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8752 recording sites in 71 patients (33 female) implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDEs), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDEs and sEEGs, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high  (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 &plusmn; 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm) was not significantly different; however, FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEGs showed much lower power for frequencies 17&ndash;200 Hz (q &lt; 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 &plusmn; 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEGs, relative to a white matter reference or a common average reference (CAR). These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans. The metrics we derive have immediate relevance to the analysis and interpretation of both cognitive and epileptic data.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Host phenotype classification from human microbiome data is mainly driven by the presence of microbial taxa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renato Giliberti, Sara Cavaliere, Italia Elisa Mauriello, Danilo Ercolini, Edoardo Pasolli</p>

Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Oxidative stress induces inflammation which in turn exacerbates oxidative stress (OS) and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a six-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Circadian clock, diurnal glucose metabolic rhythm, and dawn phenomenon</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock provides cue-independent anticipatory signals for diurnal rhythms of baseline glucose levels and glucose tolerance. The central circadian clock is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which comprises primarily GABAergic neurons. The SCN clock regulates physiological diurnal rhythms of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and hepatic insulin sensitivity through neurohumoral mechanisms. Disruption of the molecular circadian clock is associated with the extended dawn phenomenon (DP) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), referring to hyperglycemia in the early morning without nocturnal hypoglycemia.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">General anesthesia globally synchronizes activity selectively in layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Bharioke, Munz et al. discovered that different general anesthetics consistently synchronize spontaneous activity of mouse layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but of no other cortical cell type, in vivo. Strikingly, changes in synchrony across layer 5 pyramidal neurons, during transitions to and from anesthesia, coincide with loss and recovery of consciousness.

                Somatostatin is a peptide hormone that regulates endocrine systems by binding to G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors. Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a human somatostatin receptor and is highly implicated in hormone disorders, cancers and neurological diseases. Here, we report the high resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human SSTR2 bound to the agonist somatostatin (SST-14) in complex with inhibitory G (G<sub>i</sub>) proteins. Our structural and mutagenesis analyses show that seven transmembrane helices form a deep pocket for ligand binding and that SSTR2 recognizes the highly conserved Trp-Lys motif of SST-14 at the bottom of the pocket. Furthermore, our sequence analysis combined with AlphaFold modeled structures of other SSTR isoforms provide a structural basis for the mechanism by which SSTR family proteins specifically interact with their cognate ligands. This work provides the first glimpse into the molecular recognition mechanism of somatostatin receptors and a crucial resource to develop therapeutics targeting somatostatin receptors.

                Most research on glutamate spillover focuses on the deleterious consequences of postsynaptic glutamate receptor overactivation. However, two decades ago, it was noted that the glial coverage of hippocampal synapses is asymmetric: astrocytic coverage of postsynaptic sites exceeds coverage of presynaptic sites by a factor of four. The fundamental relevance of this glial asymmetry remains poorly understood. Here, we used the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR, and restricted its expression to either CA3 or CA1 neurons to visualize glutamate dynamics at pre- and postsynaptic microenvironments, respectively. We demonstrate that inhibition of the primarily astrocytic glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) slows glutamate clearance to a greater extent at presynaptic compared to postsynaptic membranes. GLT-1 expression was reduced early in a mouse model of AD, resulting in slower glutamate clearance rates at presynaptic but not postsynaptic membranes that opposed presynaptic short-term plasticity. Overall, our data demonstrate that the presynapse is particularly vulnerable to GLT-1 dysfunction and may have implications for presynaptic impairments in a variety of brain diseases.

                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons and skeletal muscle atrophy which is caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Several cellular defects contribute to sensory-motor circuit pathology in SMA mice, but the underlying mechanisms have often been studied in one mouse model without validation in other available models. Here, we used Smn2B/- mice to investigate specific behavioral, morphological, and functional aspects of SMA pathology that we previously characterized in the SMND7 model. Smn2B/- SMA mice on a pure FVB/N background display deficits in body weight gain and muscle strength with onset in the second postnatal week and median survival of 19 days. Morphological analysis revealed severe loss of proprioceptive synapses on the soma of motor neurons and prominent denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in axial but not distal muscles. In contrast, no evidence of cell death emerged from analysis of several distinct pools of lumbar motor neurons known to be lost in the disease. Moreover, SMA motor neurons from Smn2B/- mice showed robust nuclear accumulation of p53 but lack of phosphorylation of serine 18 at its amino-terminal, which selectively marks degenerating motor neurons in the SMND7 mouse model. These results indicate that NMJ denervation and deafferentation, but not motor neuron death, are conserved features of SMA pathology in Smn2B/- mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptotagmin 7 docks synaptic vesicles for Doc2α-triggered asynchronous neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis of asynchronous neurotransmitter release remains enigmatic despite decades of intense study. Synaptotagmin (syt) 7 and Doc2 have both been proposed as Ca2+ sensors that trigger this mode of exocytosis, but conflicting findings have led to controversy. Here, we demonstrate that at excitatory mouse hippocampal synapses, Doc2 is the major Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release, while syt7 supports this process through activity-dependent docking of synaptic vesicles. In synapses lacking Doc2, asynchronous release after single action potentials is strongly reduced, while deleting syt7 has no effect. However, in the absence of syt7, docked vesicles cannot recover on millisecond timescales. Consequently, both synchronous and asynchronous release depress from the second pulse on during repetitive activity. By contrast, synapses lacking Doc2 have normal activity-dependent docking, but continue to exhibit decreased asynchronous release after multiple stimuli. Moreover, disruption of both Ca2+ sensors is non-additive. These findings result in a new model whereby syt7 drives activity-dependent docking, thus 'feeding' synaptic vesicles to Doc2 for asynchronous release during on-going transmission.

                The molecular pathways that contribute to the onset of symptoms in tauopathy models, including Alzheimers Disease (AD), are difficult to distinguish because multiple changes can happen simultaneously at different stages of disease progression. Understanding early synaptic alterations and their supporting molecular pathways is essential in order to develop better pharmacological targets to treat AD. Here we focus on an early onset rTg(TauP301L)4510 tauopathy mouse model that exhibits hyperexcitability in hippocampal neurons of adult mice that is correlated with presynaptic changes and increased extracellular glutamate levels. However, it is not clear if increased extracellular glutamate is caused by presynaptic changes alone, or if presynaptic changes are a contributing factor among other factors. To determine whether pathogenic tau alters presynaptic function and glutamate release, we studied cultured hippocampal neurons at 14-18 DIV from animals of both sexes to measure presynaptic changes in tauP301L positive mice. We observed that presynaptic vesicles exhibit increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) using immunohistochemistry of fixed cells and an established pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein approach. We show that tauP301L positive neurons exhibit a 40% increase in VGLUT1 per vesicle compared to tauP301L negative littermates. Further, we use the extracellular glutamate reporter iGluSnFR to show that increased VGLUT1 per vesicle directly translates into a 40% increase in extracellular glutamate. Together, these results show that increased extracellular glutamate levels observed in tauP301L mice are not caused by increased vesicle exocytosis probability but rather are directly related to increased VGLUT1 transporters per synaptic vesicle.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid learning of predictive maps with STDP and theta phase precession</a></h4>

              
                The predictive map hypothesis is a promising candidate principle for hippocampal function. A favoured formalisation of this hypothesis, called the successor representation, proposes that each place cell encodes the expected state occupancy of its target location in the near future. This predictive framework is supported by behavioural as well as electrophysiological evidence and has desirable consequences for both the generalisability and efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, it is unclear how the successor representation might be learnt in the brain. Error-driven temporal difference learning, commonly used to learn successor representations in artificial agents, is not known to be implemented in hippocampal networks. Instead, we demonstrate that spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a form of Hebbian learning, acting on temporally compressed trajectories known as "theta sweeps", is sufficient to rapidly learn a close approximation to the successor representation. The model is biologically plausible - it uses spiking neurons modulated by theta-band oscillations, diffuse and overlapping place cell-like state representations, and experimentally matched parameters. We show how this model maps onto known aspects of hippocampal circuitry and explains substantial variance in the true successor matrix, consequently giving rise to place cells that demonstrate experimentally observed successor representation-related phenomena including backwards expansion on a 1D track and elongation near walls in 2D. Finally, our model provides insight into the observed topographical ordering of place field sizes along the dorsal-ventral axis by showing this is necessary to prevent the detrimental mixing of larger place fields, which encode longer timescale successor representations, with more fine-grained predictions of spatial location.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain network integration, flexibility and quasicyclicity during task and rest.</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that a re-organization of the brains functional connectome expressed in terms of integration and segregation may play a pivotal role. However, it has been proven difficult to capture both processes within a single network-based framework. In this study we apply a hierarchical, spatiotemporally flexible network perspective onto fMRI data to track changes in integration and segregation in time. Our results show that network integration and segregation occur simultaneously in the brain. During task performance, global changes in synchronization between networks arise which are tied to the underlying temporal design of the experiment. We show that a hallmark property of the dynamics of the brains functional connectome is a presence of quasiperiodic patterns of network activation and deactivation, which during task performance becomes intertwined with the underlying temporal structure of the experimental paradigm. The proposed approach to study spatiotemporal changes in network reconfiguration during rest as well as task performance could be useful to identify aberrant network motifs in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slowing of Frontocentral Beta Oscillations in Atypical Parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Diagnosis of atypical parkinsonian syndromes mostly relies on clinical presentation as well as structural and molecular brain imaging. It has not been investigated whether cortical oscillatory activity exhibits features distinguishing these syndromes. Therefore, we measured resting-state magnetoencephalography in 13 patients with corticobasal syndrome, 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, 23 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 23 healthy controls. We compared spectral power as well as amplitude and frequency of power peaks between the groups. Atypical Parkinsonism was associated with spectral slowing, distinguishing both corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy from age-matched healthy controls and Parkinson's disease. Patients with atypical Parkinsonism showed a shift of beta peaks (13-30 Hz) towards lower frequencies in frontal and central areas bilaterally. A concomitant increase in theta/alpha power relative to controls was observed in both atypical parkinsonian syndromes and in Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrate that slowing of frontocentral beta oscillations is characteristic of atypical Parkinsonism. Spectral slowing with a different topography has previously been observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that spectral slowing might be an electrophysiological marker of cortical neurodegeneration. As such, it might support differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical learning of distractor co-occurrences facilitates visual search</a></h4>

              
                Visual search depends on the relationship between the target and the distractors, including how the target differs from the distractors and where the target is likely to be amongst the distractors. Whether the statistical structure amongst distractors themselves facilitates search is less well understood. Here, we assessed the benefit of distractor structure using novel shapes whose relationship to each other was learned implicitly during visual search. Participants searched for target items in arrays of shapes that comprised either four pairs of co-occurring distractor shapes (structured scenes) or eight distractor shapes randomly partitioned into four pairs on each trial (unstructured scenes). Across five online experiments (N=1140), we found that after a period of search training, participants were more efficient when searching for targets in structured than unstructured scenes. This structure-benefit emerged independently of whether the position of the shapes within each pair was fixed or varied, and despite participants having no explicit knowledge of the structured pairs they had seen. These results show that learned co-occurrence statistics between distractor shapes increases search efficiency. An increased efficiency of the rejection of regular distractors may contribute to the efficiency of visual search in natural scenes, where such regularities are abundant.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive plasticity in the healthy reading network investigated through combined neurostimulation and neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                The reading network in the human brain comprises several regions, including the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) and dorsal temporo-parietal cortex (TPC). The left TPC is crucial for phonological decoding, i.e., for learning and retaining sound-letter mappings. Here, we tested the causal contribution of this area for reading with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and explored the response of the reading network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 28 healthy adult readers overtly read simple and complex words and pseudowords during fMRI after effective or sham TMS over the left TPC. Behaviorally, effective stimulation slowed pseudoword reading. A multivariate pattern analysis showed a shift in activity patterns in the left IFC for pseudoword reading after effective relative to sham TMS. Furthermore, active TMS led to increased effective connectivity from the left vOTC to the left TPC, specifically for pseudoword processing. The observed changes in task-related activity and connectivity suggest compensatory reorganization in the reading network following TMS-induced disruption of the left TPC. Our findings provide first evidence for a causal role of the left TPC for overt pseudoword reading and emphasize the relevance of functional interactions in the healthy reading network for successful pseudoword processing.

	<p>Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder affecting one billion people worldwide, mainly females. It is characterized by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain, with associated symptoms. Receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1) is part of the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) receptor, a pharmacological target for migraine. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, play a role in clinical presentation of various diseases. DNA methylation occurs mostly in the gene promoter and can control gene expression. We investigated the methylation state of the RAMP1 promoter in 104 female blood DNA samples: 54 migraineurs and 50 controls. We treated DNA with sodium bisulfite and performed PCR, Sanger Sequencing, and Epigenetic Sequencing Methylation (ESME) software analysis. We identified 51 CpG dinucleotides, and 5 showed methylation variability. Migraineurs had a higher number of individuals with all five CpG methylated when compared to controls (26% vs. 16%), although non-significant (p = 0.216). We also found that CpG &amp;amp;minus;284 bp, related to the transcription start site (TSS), showed higher methylation levels in cases (p = 0.011). This CpG may potentially play a role in migraine, affecting RAMP1 transcription or receptor malfunctioning and/or altered CGRP binding. We hope to confirm this finding in a larger cohort and establish an epigenetic biomarker to predict female migraine risk.</p>

	<p>An important problem in many fields dealing with noisy time series, such as psychophysiological single trial data during learning or monitoring treatment effects over time, is detecting a change in the model underlying a time series. Here, we present a new method for detecting a single changepoint in a linear time series regression model, termed residuals permutation-based method (RESPERM). The optimal changepoint in RESPERM maximizes Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size with the parameters estimated by the permutation of residuals in a linear model. RESPERM was compared with the SEGMENTED method, a well-established and recommended method for detecting changepoints, using extensive simulated data sets, varying the amount and distribution characteristics of noise and the location of the change point. In time series with medium to large amounts of noise, the variance of the detected changepoint was consistently smaller for RESPERM than SEGMENTED. Finally, both methods were applied to a sample dataset of single trial amplitudes of the N250 ERP component during face learning. In conclusion, RESPERM appears to be well suited for changepoint detection especially in noisy data, making it the method of choice in neuroscience, medicine and many other fields.</p>

	<p>Previous studies on the neural cognitive mechanisms of aspectual processing in second language (L2) learners have focused on Indo-European languages with rich inflectional morphology. These languages have aspects which are equipped with inflected verb forms combined with auxiliary or modal verbs. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to Mandarin Chinese, which has limited morphological inflection, and its aspect is equipped with aspectual particles (e.g., le, zhe, guo). The present study explores the neurocognitive mechanism of Mandarin Chinese aspect processing among two groups of late Mandarin Chinese proficient learners with Thai (with Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) and Indonesian (lack of Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) as their first language (L1). We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) time locked to the aspect marker le in two different conditions (the aspect violation sentences and the correct sentences). A triphasic ELAN-LAN-P600 effect was produced by the Mandarin Chinese native speakers. However, there was no ELAN and LAN in Indonesian native speakers and Thai native speakers, except a 300&amp;amp;ndash;500 ms negativity widely distributed in the right hemisphere and P600-like effect. This suggests that both groups of Mandarin Chinese learners cannot reach the same level as Mandarin Chinese native speakers to process Mandarin Chinese aspect information, probably due to the complex feature of Mandarin Chinese aspect maker, the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; L2 proficiency and age of L2 acquisition.</p>

	<p>Many studies of bilingual arithmetic report better performance when verifying arithmetic facts in the language of learning (LA+) over the other language (LA&amp;amp;minus;). This could be due to language-specific memory representations, processes established during learning, or to language and task factors not related to math. The current study builds on a small number of event-related potential (ERP) studies to test this question while controlling language proficiency and eliminating potential task confounds. Adults proficient in two languages verified single-digit multiplications presented as spoken number words in LA+ and LA&amp;amp;minus;, separately. ERPs and correctness judgments were measured from solution onset. Equivalent P300 effects, with larger positive amplitude for correct than incorrect solutions, were observed in both languages (Experiment 1A), even when stimuli presentation rate was shortened to increase difficulty (Experiment 1B). This effect paralleled the arithmetic correctness effect for trials presented as all digits (e.g., 2 4 8 versus 2 4 10), reflecting efficient categorization of the solutions, and was distinct from an N400 generated in a word&amp;amp;ndash;picture matching task, reflecting meaning processing (Experiment 2). The findings reveal that the language effects on arithmetic are likely driven by language and task factors rather than differences in memory representation in each language.</p>

	<p>Previous research has shown that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between different brain regions (seeds) is related to motor learning and motor memory consolidation. Using high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG), we addressed this question from a brain network perspective. Specifically, we examined frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks from twenty-nine young healthy participants before and after they were trained on a motor sequence learning task. Consolidation was assessed with an overnight retest on the motor task. Our results showed training-related decreases in gamma-band connectivity within the motor network, and between the motor and functionally distinct resting-state networks including the attentional network. Brain-behavior correlation analyses revealed that baseline beta, delta, and theta rsFC were related to subsequent motor learning and memory consolidation such that lower connectivity within the motor network and between the motor and several distinct resting-state networks was correlated with better learning and overnight consolidation. Lastly, training-related increases in beta-band connectivity between the motor and the visual networks were related to greater consolidation. Altogether, our results indicate that connectivity in large-scale resting-state brain networks is related to&amp;amp;mdash;and modulated by&amp;amp;mdash;motor learning and memory consolidation processes. These finding corroborate previous seed-based connectivity research and provide evidence that frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks is critically linked to motor learning and memory consolidation.</p>

	<p>Prospective memory (PM) is essential in the everyday activities of children because it involves remembering intentions for the future, such as doing their homework or bringing written parental permissions to school. Developmental studies have shown increases in PM performance throughout childhood, but the specific processes underlying this development are still under debate. In the present study, event-related potentials were used to examine whether the focality of the PM task is related to the PM increments by testing two groups of children (first and last cycle of primary school) and assessing differences in N300 (cue detection), frontal positivity (switching), parietal positivity (retrieval of the intention) and frontal slow waves (monitoring of the retrieved intention). The results showed significant differences in focality in the group of older children but no differences in any of the components for their younger counterparts. In addition, the differences between prospective and ongoing trials were smaller for younger than older children. These findings suggest that the ability to adjust attentional strategies, monitor, switch and retrieve the intention develops across childhood and affects PM performance in attentionally demanding conditions.</p>

	<p>A concomitant presentation of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is quite rare. However, a review of the literature showed an increased co-occurrence of both diseases, including in genetically determined cases. We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of RRMS who developed a progressive subacute loss of strength in her left arm. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s father died from ALS, and her paternal uncle had Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Brain and cervical MRIs were performed, and new demyelinating lesions were excluded. Electromyography (EMG) of the upper limbs showed fibrillations and fasciculations in distal muscles of both arms. In the following months, the patient presented a progressive loss of strength in the proximal and distal muscles of the right arm and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. EMG and central motor conduction were consistent with ALS. A genetic test was carried out, revealing a mutation in the FUS gene (exon 15; c. 1562 G&amp;amp;gt;A). To our knowledge, the co-occurrence of MS and ALS in patients with FUS mutation is extremely rare. We hypothesize a common pathway for both diseases based on the possibility of a shared oligodendroglial dysfunction due to FUS mutation.</p>

	<p>Financial abilities (FA) are a multi-dimensional domain comprising a wide range of conceptual, pragmatical, and judgmental skills ranging from basic abilities, such as bill payment, to high level abilities, such as financial decision-making (FDM). Preserved FDM abilities include the capacity to recognize fraud attempts, and they are fundamental for a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s independence. Previous studies have reported decreased FDM in older adults and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who consequently become more susceptible to fraud attempts. However, FDM has scarcely been investigated in other neurological populations, and it is unclear whether FDM may be predicted by more basic FA. The aim of the present study was to investigate FDM across patients with MCI, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), or stroke, as well as healthy controls (HC), and to explore to what extent FDM could be inferred by other FA. We collected FDM and FA performances using the NADL-F short battery. Performances in the NADL-F short subtests were compared among groups. Additionally, the relationship between the scores at the FDM subtest and the performance obtained in other financial subtests of the NADL-F short were investigated for each group of participants. MCI patients performed worse than HC in FDM and in several FA domains. Conversely, FDM was relatively preserved in our sample of PD and stroke patients. In HC, FDM was associated with numeracy and financial knowledge applied to everyday situations, whereas this was true with some basic FA in both MCI and PD patients. No significant association was observed in stroke patients. Our results suggest that FDM is a complex ability, only partially inferable from other FA.</p>

	<p>Intracranial vessel wall lesions are involved in a variety of neurological diseases. The advanced technique 7T MRI provides greater efficacy in the diagnosis of the pathology changes in the vessel wall and helps to identify potential subtle lesions. The purpose of this literature review was to systematically describe and evaluate the existing literature focusing on the use of 7T MRI in the detection and characterization of intracranial vessel wall lesions and their associated neurological disorders, to highlight the current knowledge gaps, and to formulate a framework to guide future applications and investigations. We systematically reviewed the existing articles up to July 2021, seeking the studies that assessed intracranial vessel wall lesions and their associated neurological disorders using 7T MRI. The literature search provided 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The most common intracranial vessel wall lesions were changes related to intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 8) and aneurysms (n = 4), such as intracranial atherosclerosis burden and aneurysm wall enhancement. The associated neurological disorders included aneurysms, ischemic stroke or TIA, small vessel disease, cognitive decline, and extracranial atherosclerosis. No paper studied the use of 7T MRI for investigating vessel wall conditions such as moyamoya disease, small vessel disease, or neurological disorders related to central nervous vasculitis. In conclusion, the novel 7T MRI enables the identification of a wider spectrum of subtle changes and associations. Future research on cerebral vascular diseases other than intracranial atherosclerosis and aneurysms may also benefit from 7T MRI.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality across all age groups globally. Currently, only palliative treatments exist, but these are suboptimal and do little to combat the progressive damage to the brain that occurs after a TBI. However, multiple experimental treatments are currently available that target the primary and secondary biochemical and cellular changes that occur after a TBI. Some of these drugs have progressed to clinical trials and are currently being evaluated for their therapeutic benefits in TBI patients. The aim of this study was to identify which drugs are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for TBI. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov was performed on 3 December 2021 and all clinical trials that mentioned &amp;amp;ldquo;TBI&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;traumatic brain injury&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;drug&amp;amp;rdquo; were searched, revealing 362 registered trials. Of the trials, 46 were excluded due to the drug not being mentioned, leaving 138 that were completed and 116 that were withdrawn. Although the studies included 267,298 TBI patients, the average number of patients per study was 865 with a range of 5&amp;amp;ndash;200,000. Of the completed studies, 125 different drugs were tested in TBI patients but only 7 drugs were used in more than three studies, including amantadine, botulinum toxin A and tranexamic acid (TXA). However, previous clinical studies using these seven drugs showed variable results. The current study concludes that clinical trials in TBI have to be carefully conducted so as to reduce variability across studies, since the severity of TBI and timing of therapeutic interventions were key aspects of trial success.</p>

     alt="BET protein inhibition in macrophages enhances dorsal root ganglion neurite outgrowth in female mice"/>
<p>Treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 does not enhance sensory and motor regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in female mice (Top). Direct neuronal BET inhibition reduces neurite outgrowth in DRG explants (Middle). However, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors, probably anti-inflammatory cytokines that enhance STAT 6 phosphorylation and neuritogenesis ex vivo (Bottom).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve regeneration is limited after injury, especially in humans, due to the large distance the axons have to grow in the limbs. This process is highly dependent on the expression of neuroinflammatory factors produced by macrophages and glial cells. Given the importance of the epigenetic BET proteins on inflammation, we aimed to ascertain if BET inhibition may have an effect on axonal outgrowth. For this purpose, we treated female mice with JQ1 or vehicle after sciatic nerve crush injury and analyzed target reinnervation. We also used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture explants to analyze the effects of direct BET inhibition or treatment with conditioned medium from BET-inhibited macrophages. We observed that although JQ1 produced an enhancement of IL-4, IL-13, and GAP43 expression, it did not have an effect on sensory or motor reinnervation after crush injury in vivo. In contrast, JQ1 reduced neurite growth when interacting directly with DRG neurons ex vivo, whereas conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages promoted neurite outgrowth. Therefore, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors that induce neurite outgrowth, and that may counteract the direct inhibition of BET proteins in neurons in vivo. Finally, we observed an activation of the STAT6 pathway in DRG explants treated with conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BET protein inhibition in macrophages provides a mechanism to enhance axonal outgrowth. However, specific targeting of BET proteins to macrophages will be needed to efficiently enhance functional recovery after nerve injury.</p>

     alt="Gray matter volume reduction in the emotional brain networks in adults with anosmia"/>
<p>In our study, we examined the network-level changes of the gray matter volumes in anosmia. Patients with anosmia had the lower gray matter volumes in the emotional brain networks relative to healthy controls. Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

     alt="The role of sex in the association between cannabis use and working memory-related brain activity"/>
<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load.

<p>Astrocyte calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes increases with Aß pathology and age. Increased calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes does not affect astrocyte network activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients <i>ex vivo</i> in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to Aβ plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity <i>ex vivo</i>. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and Aβ pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Concomitant exploration of structural, functional, and neurochemical brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline is crucial in promoting healthy aging. Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain’s structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20–80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (<i>n</i> = 20, &gt;65 years) was additionally scanned with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Interleukin-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) through the activation of microglia. It is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is thought to be associated with inflammation in many neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke and poststroke depression, but the role of IL-18 in inflammatory injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this study, we established the ICH model in male mice and found that IL-18 expression including protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in brain tissues after ICH. Meanwhile, exogenous IL-18 exacerbated cerebral hematoma and neurological deficits following ICH. In the IL-18 knockout group, the size of hematoma and neurological functions after ICH was decreased compared with the wild-type group, suggesting the critical role of IL-18 on the modulation of brain injury after ICH. Importantly, exogenous IL-18 increased microglial activation in brain tissues after ICH. Furthermore, IL-18 knockout resulted in the reduction of activated microglia after ICH. These results indicated that IL-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after ICH through the activation of microglia. Thus, IL-18 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>

<p>Activating subpopulations of <i>parafascicular</i> (Pf) neurons selected on the basis of their projections to different basal ganglia components shows that the activity of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr) can be shaped by convergent information processed through direct thalamonigral (1), trans-subthalamic (2), and trans-striatal direct (3) and indirect (4) subcircuits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence implicates the <i>parafascicular nucleus</i> of the thalamus (Pf) in basal ganglia (BG)-related functions and pathologies. Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whether mathematics is a gendered domain or not is a long-lasting issue bringing along major social and educational implications. The females' underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has been considered one of the key signs of the math gender gap, although the current view largely attributes the origin of this phenomenon to sociocultural factors. Indeed, recent approaches to math gender differences reached the universal conclusion that nature and nurture exert reciprocal effects on each other, establishing the need for approaching the study of the math gender issue only once its intrinsic complexity has been accepted. Building upon a flourishing literature, this review provides an updated synthesis of the evidence for math gender equality at the start, and for math gender inequality on the go, challenging the role of biological factors. In particular, by combining recent findings from different research areas, the paper discusses the persistence of the “math male myth” and the associated “female are not good at math myth,” drawing attention to the complex interplay of social and cultural forces that support such stereotypes. The suggestion is made that longevity of these myths results from the additive effects of two independent cognitive biases associated with gender stereotypes and with math stereotypes, respectively. Scholars' responsibility in amplifying these myths by pursuing some catching lines of research is also discussed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including diffuse axonal injury, are influenced by the direction, magnitude, and duration of head acceleration during the injury exposure. Ovine models have been used to study injury mechanics and pathological outcomes of TBI. To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit–mass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8 ± 3.1 mm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7 ± 1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4 ± 3.2 mm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both “normal” C57Bl/6J and “depressive” ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in “depressive” ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of the lateral septum in neuropsychiatric disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is a structure in the midline of the brain that is interconnected with areas associated with stress and feeding. This review highlights the role of the LS in anxiety, depression, and eating disorders and their comorbidity. There is a prevailing view that the LS is anxiolytic. This review finds that the LS is both anxiolytic and anxiogenic. Furthermore, the LS can promote and inhibit feeding. Given these shared roles, the LS represents a common site for the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric disorders, and therefore a potential pharmacological target. This is crucial since currently available treatments are not always effective. Corticotrophin-releasing factor 2 antagonists are potential drugs for the treatment of anxiety and anorexia and require further research. Furthermore, other drugs currently in trials for binge eating, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, may in fact promote food intake. It is hoped that the advancements in chemo- and optogenetic techniques will allow future studies to profile the specific neural connections of the LS and their function. This information could facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and therefore pharmacological targets, of these psychiatric conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prenatal Opioid Exposure Impairs Endocannabinoid and Glutamate Transmission in the Dorsal Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The opioid crisis has contributed to a growing population of children exposed to opioids during fetal development; however, many of the long-term effects of opioid exposure on development are unknown. We previously demonstrated that opioids have deleterious effects on endocannabinoid plasticity at glutamate synapses in the dorsal striatum of adolescent rodents, but it is unclear whether prenatal opioid exposure produces similar neuroadaptations. Using a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), we performed proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to examine synaptic functioning in adolescent PME offspring. PME impacted the proteome and phosphoproteome in a region- and sex-dependent manner. Many proteins and phosphorylated proteins associated with glutamate transmission were differentially abundant in PME offspring, which was associated with reduced glutamate release in the DLS and altered the rise time of excitatory events in the DMS. Similarly, the intrinsic excitability properties of DMS neurons were significantly affected by PME. Last, pathway analyses revealed an enrichment in retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the DLS, but not in the DMS, of males. Electrophysiology studies confirmed that endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression was impaired in the DLS, but not DMS, of PME-males. These results indicate that PME induces persistent neuroadaptations in the dorsal striatum and could contribute to the aberrant behavioral development described in offspring with prenatal opioid exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Oral and Injected Tamoxifen Alter Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Female and Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inducible Cre recombinase facilitates temporal control of genetic recombination in numerous transgenic model systems, a feature which has made it a popular tool for adult neurogenesis studies. One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreER<sup>T2</sup>, requires activation by the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here, we compare a standard, 5 d TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup>;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that two weeks of TAM chow and 5 d of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation three weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period. These findings provide guidance for selection of TAM administration route and appropriate controls in adult neurogenesis studies using TAM-inducible Cre mice. They also highlight the need for better understanding of off-target effects of TAM in other neurologic processes and organ systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prolonged Feedback Duration Does Not Affect Implicit Recalibration in a Visuomotor Rotation Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visuomotor rotations are frequently used to study cognitive processes underlying motor adaptation. Explicit aiming strategies and implicit recalibration are two of these processes. A large body of literature indicates that both processes are in fact dissociable and mainly independent components that can be measured using different manipulations in visuomotor rotation tasks. Visual feedback is a crucial element in these tasks, and it therefore plays an important role when assessing explicit re-aiming and implicit recalibration. For instance, researchers have found timing of visual feedback to affect the contribution of implicit recalibration to learning: if feedback is shown only at the end of the movement (instead of continuously), implicit recalibration decreases. Similarly, participants show lower levels of implicit recalibration if visual feedback is presented with a delay (instead of immediately). We thus hypothesized that the duration of feedback availability might also play a role. The goal of this study was thus to investigate the effect of longer versus shorter feedback durations on implicit recalibration in human participants. To this end, we compared three feedback durations in a between-subject design: 200, 600, and 1200 ms. Using a large sample size, we found differences between groups to be quite small, to the point where most differences indicated statistical equivalence between group means. We therefore hypothesize that feedback duration, when only endpoint feedback is presented, has a negligible effect on implicit recalibration. We propose that future research investigate the effect of feedback duration on other parameters of adaptation, so as proprioceptive recalibration and explicit re-aiming.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Semi-Automated Workflow for Brain Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Cell Quantification (SHARCQ)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tools for refined cell-specific targeting have significantly contributed to understanding the characteristics and dynamics of distinct cellular populations by brain region. While advanced cell-labeling methods have accelerated the field of neuroscience, specifically in brain mapping, there remains a need to quantify and analyze the data. Here, by modifying a toolkit that localizes electrodes to brain regions (SHARP-Track; Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Probe-Track analysis), we introduce a post-imaging analysis tool to map histological images to established mouse brain atlases called SHARCQ (Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Cell Quantification). The program requires MATLAB, histological images, and either a manual or automatic cell count of the unprocessed images. SHARCQ simplifies the post-imaging analysis pipeline with a step-by-step GUI. We demonstrate that SHARCQ can be applied for a variety of mouse brain images, regardless of histology technique. In addition, SHARCQ rectifies discrepancies in mouse brain region borders between atlases by allowing the user to select between the Allen Brain Atlas or the digitized and modified Franklin&ndash;Paxinos Atlas for quantifying cell counts by region. SHARCQ produces quantitative and qualitative data, including counts of brain-wide region populations and a 3D model of registered cells within the atlas space. In summary, SHARCQ was designed as a neuroscience post-imaging analysis tool for cell-to-brain registration and quantification with a simple, accessible interface. All code is open-source and available for download (<A HREF="https://github.com/wildrootlab/SHARCQ">https://github.com/wildrootlab/SHARCQ</A>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Proposed Role for Interactions between Argonautes, miRISC, and RNA Binding Proteins in the Regulation of Local Translation in Neurons and Glia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first evidence of local translation in the CNS appeared nearly 40 years ago, when electron microscopic studies showed polyribosomes localized to the base of dendritic spines. Since then, local translation has been established as an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression in polarized or functionally compartmentalized cells. While much attention has been placed on characterizing the local transcriptome and regulatory "grammar" directing mRNA localization in neurons and glia, less is understood about how these cells subsequently de-repress mRNA translation in their peripheral processes to produce a rapid translational response to stimuli. MicroRNA-mediated translation regulation offers a possible solution to this question. Not only do miRNAs provide the specificity needed for targeted gene regulation, but association and dynamic interactions between Argonaute (AGO) with sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins may provide a molecular switch to allow for de-repression of target mRNAs. Here, we review the expression and activity of different AGO proteins in miRNA-induced silencing complexes in neurons and glia and discuss known pathways of miRNA-mediated regulation, including activity-dependent pre-miRNA maturation in dendrites. We further detail work on AGO and RNA-binding protein interactions that allow for the reversal of miRNA-mediated translational silencing, and we propose a model for how intercellular communication may play a role in the regulation of local translation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KCNQ Channels Enable Reliable Presynaptic Spiking and Synaptic Transmission at High Frequency</a></h4>

              
                <p>The presynaptic action potential (AP) is required to drive calcium influx into nerve terminals, resulting in neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, the AP waveform is crucial in determining the timing and strength of synaptic transmission. The calyx of Held nerve terminals of rats of either sex showed minimum changes in AP waveform during high-frequency AP firing. We found that the stability of the calyceal AP waveform requires KCNQ (K<SUB>V</SUB>7) K<sup>+</sup> channel activation during high-frequency spiking activity. High-frequency presynaptic spikes gradually led to accumulation of KCNQ channels in open states which kept interspike membrane potential sufficiently negative to maintain Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability. Blocking KCNQ channels during stimulus trains led to inactivation of presynaptic Na<sup>+</sup>, and to a lesser extent K<SUB>V</SUB>1 channels, thereby reducing the AP amplitude and broadening AP duration. Moreover, blocking KCNQ channels disrupted the stable calcium influx and glutamate release required for reliable synaptic transmission at high frequency. Thus, while KCNQ channels are generally thought to prevent hyperactivity of neurons, we find that in axon terminals these channels function to facilitate reliable high-frequency synaptic signaling needed for sensory information processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The presynaptic spike results in calcium influx required for neurotransmitter release. For this reason, the spike waveform is crucial in determining the timing and strength of synaptic transmission. Auditory information is encoded by spikes phase locked to sound frequency at high rates. The calyx of Held nerve terminals in the auditory brainstem show minimum changes in spike waveform during high-frequency spike firing. We found that activation of KCNQ K<sup>+</sup> channel builds up during high-frequency firing and its activation helps to maintain a stable spike waveform and reliable synaptic transmission. While KCNQ channels are generally thought to prevent hyperexcitability of neurons, we find that in axon terminals these channels function to facilitate high-frequency synaptic signaling during auditory information processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Opioid-Induced Pronociceptive Signaling in the Gastrointestinal Tract Is Mediated by Delta-Opioid Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioid tolerance (OT) leads to dose escalation and serious side effects, including opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We sought to better understand the mechanisms underlying this event in the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic <I>in vivo</I> administration of morphine by intraperitoneal injection in male C57BL/6 mice evoked tolerance and evidence of OIH in an assay of colonic afferent nerve mechanosensitivity; this was inhibited by the -opioid receptor (DOPr) antagonist naltrindole when intraperitoneally injected in previous morphine administration. Patch-clamp studies of DRG neurons following overnight incubation with high concentrations of morphine, the &micro;-opioid receptors (MOPr) agonist [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, N-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>, Gly<sup>5</sup>-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) or the DOPr agonist [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, D-Leu<sup>5</sup>]-Enkephalin evoked hyperexcitability. The pronociceptive actions of these opioids were blocked by the DOPr antagonist SDM25N but not the MOPr antagonist D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH<SUB>2</SUB>. The hyperexcitability induced by DAMGO was reversed after a 1 h washout, but reapplication of low concentrations of DAMGO or [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, D-Leu<sup>5</sup>]-Enkephalin restored the hyperexcitability, an effect mediated by protein kinase C. DOPr-dependent DRG neuron hyperexcitability was blocked by the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop 2, and the weakly internalizing DOPr agonist ARM390 did not cause hyperexcitability. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in HEK cells showed no evidence of switching of G-protein signaling from G<SUB>i</SUB> to a G<SUB>s</SUB> pathway in response to either high concentrations or overnight incubation of opioids. Thus, chronic high-dose opioid exposure leads to opioid tolerance and features of OIH in the colon. This action is mediated by DOPr signaling and is dependent on receptor endocytosis and downstream protein kinase C signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids are effective in the treatment of abdominal pain, but escalating doses can lead to opioid tolerance and potentially opioid-induced hyperalgesia. We found that -opioid receptor (DOPr) plays a central role in the development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in colonic afferent nociceptors following prolonged exposure to high concentrations of MOPr or DOPr agonists. Furthermore, the role of DOPr was dependent on OPr internalization and activation of a protein kinase C signaling pathway. Thus, targeting DOPr or key components of the downstream signaling pathway could mitigate adverse side effects by opioids.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Non-Nuclear NF-{kappa}B Modulates Alcohol Sensitivity But Not Immunity</a></h4>

              
                <p>NF-B proteins are well known as transcription factors important in immune system activation. In this highly conserved role, they contribute to changes in behavior in response to infection and in response to a variety of other insults and experiences. In some mammalian neurons, NF-Bs can be found at the synapse and translocate to the nucleus to alter gene expression when activated by synaptic activity. Here, we demonstrate that, in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, NF-B action is important both inside and outside the nucleus and that the <I>Dif</I> gene has segregated nuclear and non-nuclear NF-B action into different protein isoforms. The DifA isoform is a canonical nuclear-acting NF-B protein that enters the nucleus and is important for combating infection. The DifB variant, but not the DifA variant, is found in the central nervous system (mushroom bodies and antennal lobes). DifB does not enter the nucleus and co-localizes with a synaptic protein. In males and females, a DifB mutant alters alcohol behavioral sensitivity without an obvious effect on combating infection, whereas a DifA mutant does not affect alcohol sensitivity but compromises the immune response. These data are evidence that the non-nuclear DifB variant contributes to alcohol behavioral sensitivity by a nongenomic mechanism that diverges from the NF-B transcriptional effects used in the peripheral immune system. Enrichment of DifB in brain regions rich in synapses and biochemical enrichment of DifB in the synaptoneurosome fraction indicates that the protein may act locally at the synapse.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NF-Bs are transcription factors used by innate immune signaling pathways to protect against infection. Alcohol abuse also activates these pathways, which contributes to the addictive process and the health consequences associated with alcohol abuse. In the mammalian nervous system, NF-Bs localize to synapses, but it is axiomatic that they effect change by acting in the nucleus. However, for the Drosophila <I>Dif</I> gene, immune and neural function segregate into different protein isoforms. Whereas the nuclear isoform (DifA) activates immune genes in response to infection, the CNS isoform acts nongenomically to modulate alcohol sensitivity. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assays localize DifB to synapse-rich regions. Direct synaptic action would provide a novel and rapid way for NF-B signaling to modulate behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Formation of the Mouse Internal Capsule and Cerebral Peduncle: A Pioneering Role for Striatonigral Axons as Revealed in Isl1 Conditional Mutants</a></h4>

              
                <p>The projection neurons of the striatum, the principal nucleus of the basal ganglia, belong to one of the following two major pathways: the striatopallidal (indirect) pathway or the striatonigral (direct) pathway. Striatonigral axons project long distances and encounter ascending tracts (thalamocortical) while coursing alongside descending tracts (corticofugal) as they extend through the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle. These observations suggest that striatal circuitry may help to guide their trajectories. To investigate the developmental contributions of striatonigral axons to internal capsule formation, we have made use of <I>Sox8-EGFP</I> (striatal direct pathway) and <I>Fezf2-TdTomato</I> (corticofugal pathway) BAC transgenic reporter mice in combination with immunohistochemical markers to trace these axonal pathways throughout development. We show that striatonigral axons pioneer the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle and are temporally and spatially well positioned to provide guidance for corticofugal and thalamocortical axons. Using <I>Isl1</I> conditional knock-out (cKO) mice, which exhibit disrupted striatonigral axon outgrowth, we observe both corticofugal and thalamocortical axon defects with either ventral forebrain- or telencephalon-specific <I>Isl1</I> inactivation, despite Isl1 not being expressed in either cortical or thalamic projection neurons. Striatonigral axon defects can thus disrupt internal capsule formation. Our genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in <I>Isl1</I> cKOs reveals changes in gene expression relevant to cell adhesion, growth cone dynamics, and extracellular matrix composition, suggesting potential mechanisms by which the striatonigral pathway exerts this guidance role. Together, our data support a novel pioneering role for the striatal direct pathway in the correct assembly of the ascending and descending axon tracts within the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei with established roles in the coordination of voluntary motor programs, aspects of cognition, and the selection of appropriate social behaviors. Hence, disruptions in basal ganglia connectivity have been implicated in the motor, cognitive, and social dysfunction characterizing common neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder, and tic disorder. Here, we identified a novel role for the striatonigral (direct) pathway in pioneering the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle, and in guiding axons extending to and from the cortex. Our findings suggest that the abnormal development of basal ganglia circuits can drive secondary internal capsule defects and thereby may contribute to the pathology of these disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Model of Direction Selectivity in Macaque V1 Cortex Based on Dynamic Differences between On and Off Pathways</a></h4>

              
                <p>This paper is about neural mechanisms of direction selectivity (DS) in macaque primary visual cortex, V1. We present data (on male macaque) showing strong DS in a majority of simple cells in V1 layer 4C&alpha;, the cortical layer that receives direct afferent input from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Magnocellular LGN cells are not direction-selective. To understand the mechanisms of DS, we built a large-scale, recurrent model of spiking neurons called DSV1. Like its predecessors, DSV1 reproduces many visual response properties of V1 cells including orientation selectivity. Two important new features of DSV1 are (1) DS is initiated by small, consistent dynamic differences in the visual responses of OFF and ON Magnocellular LGN cells, and (2) DS in the responses of most model simple cells is increased over those of their feedforward inputs; this increase is achieved through dynamic interaction of feedforward and intracortical synaptic currents without the use of intracortical direction-specific connections. The DSV1 model emulates experimental data in the following ways: (1) most 4C&alpha; Simple cells were highly direction-selective but 4C&alpha; Complex cells were not; (2) the preferred directions of the model's direction-selective Simple cells were invariant with spatial and temporal frequency (TF); (3) the distribution of the preferred/opposite ratio across the model's population of cells was very close to that found in experiments. The strong quantitative agreement between DS in data and in model simulations suggests that the neural mechanisms of DS in DSV1 may be similar to those in the real visual cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motion perception is a vital part of our visual experience of the world. In monkeys, whose vision resembles that of humans, the neural computation of the direction of a moving target starts in the primary visual cortex, V1, in layer 4C&alpha; that receives input from the eye through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). How direction selectivity (DS) is generated in layer 4C&alpha; is an outstanding unsolved problem in theoretical neuroscience. In this paper, we offer a solution based on plausible biological mechanisms. We present a new large-scale circuit model in which DS originates from slightly different LGN ON/OFF response time-courses and is enhanced in cortex without the need for direction-specific intracortical connections. The model's DS is in quantitative agreement with experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Descending Axonal Projections from the Inferior Colliculus Target Nearly All Excitatory and Inhibitory Cell Types of the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) integrates auditory nerve input with nonauditory sensory signals and is proposed to function in sound source localization and suppression of self-generated sounds. The DCN also integrates activity from descending auditory pathways, including a particularly large feedback projection from the inferior colliculus (IC), the main ascending target of the DCN. Understanding how these descending feedback signals are integrated into the DCN circuit and what role they play in hearing requires knowing the targeted DCN cell types and their postsynaptic responses. In order to explore these questions, neurons in the DCN that received descending synaptic input from the IC were labeled with a trans-synaptic viral approach in male and female mice, which allowed them to be targeted for whole-cell recording in acute brain slices. We tested their synaptic responses to optogenetic activation of the descending IC projection. Every cell type in the granule cell domain received monosynaptic, glutamatergic input from the IC, indicating that this region, considered an integrator of nonauditory sensory inputs, processes auditory input as well and may have complex and underappreciated roles in hearing. Additionally, we found that DCN cell types outside the granule cell regions also receive descending IC signals, including the principal projection neurons, as well as the neurons that inhibit them, leading to a circuit that may sharpen tuning through feedback excitation and lateral inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory processing starts in the cochlea and ascends through the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the inferior colliculus (IC) and beyond. Here, we investigated the feedback projection from IC to DCN, whose synaptic targets and roles in auditory processing are unclear. We found that all cell types in the granule cell regions, which process multisensory feedback, also process this descending auditory feedback. Surprisingly, all except one cell type in the entire DCN receive IC input. The IC-DCN projection may therefore modulate the multisensory pathway as well as sharpen tuning and gate auditory signals that are sent to downstream areas. This excitatory feedback loop from DCN to IC and back to DCN could underlie hyperexcitability in DCN, widely considered an etiology of tinnitus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Domain-Specific Sampling of Long-Range Axons Shapes Feedforward and Feedback Connectivity of L5 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feedforward and feedback pathways interact in specific dendritic domains to enable cognitive functions such as predictive processing and learning. Based on axonal projections, hierarchically lower areas are thought to form synapses primarily on dendrites in middle cortical layers, whereas higher-order areas are thought to target dendrites in layer 1 and in deep layers. However, the extent to which functional synapses form in regions of axodendritic overlap has not been extensively studied. Here, we use viral tracing in the secondary visual cortex of male mice to map brain-wide inputs to thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive map of input locations through subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping. We show that input pathways target distinct dendritic domains with far greater specificity than appears from their axonal branching, often deviating substantially from the canonical patterns. Common assumptions regarding the dendrite-level interaction of feedforward and feedback inputs may thus need revisiting.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perception and learning depend on the ability of the brain to shape neuronal representations across all processing stages. Long-range connections across different hierarchical levels enable diverse sources of contextual information, such as predictions or motivational state, to modify feedforward signals. Assumptions regarding the organization of this hierarchical connectivity have not been extensively verified. Here, we assess the synaptic connectivity of brain-wide projections onto pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of mice. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping, we show that functional synapses do not follow the consistent connectivity rule predicted by their axonal branching patterns. These findings highlight the diversity of computational strategies operating throughout cortical networks and may aid in building better artificial networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatic Depolarization Enhances Hippocampal CA1 Dendritic Spike Propagation and Distal Input-Driven Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic inputs that target distal regions of neuronal dendrites can often generate local dendritic spikes that can amplify synaptic depolarization, induce synaptic plasticity, and enhance neuronal output. However, distal dendritic spikes are subject to significant attenuation by dendritic cable properties, and often produce only a weak subthreshold depolarization of the soma. Nonetheless, such spikes have been implicated in memory storage, sensory perception and place field formation. How can such a weak somatic response produce such powerful behavioral effects? Here, we use dual dendritic and somatic recordings in acute hippocampal slices of male mice to reveal that dendritic spike propagation, but not spike initiation, is strongly enhanced when the somatic resting potential is depolarized, likely as a result of increased inactivation of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Somatic depolarization also facilitates the induction of a form of dendritic spike driven heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances memory specificity. Thus, the effect of somatic membrane depolarization to enhance dendritic spike propagation and long-term synaptic plasticity is likely to play an important role in hippocampal-dependent spatial representations as well as learning and memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons receive synaptic input along their dendrites but produce action potential (AP) output at their soma. Signals arriving at the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) have little impact on the soma unless they combine to initiate a dendritic spike, which needs to propagate to the soma to trigger an AP. This study shows that small subthreshold depolarization of the soma powerfully enhances the propagation of dendritic spikes, through inactivation of dendritic A-type potassium channels. Enhanced dendritic spike propagation also markedly facilitates the induction of a form of plasticity driven by the distal synaptic inputs. Thus, small changes in somatic membrane potential, similar to those observed <I>in vivo</I>, act as a powerful gate of neuronal information transfer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupted Choline Clearance and Sustained Acetylcholine Release In Vivo by a Common Choline Transporter Coding Variant Associated with Poor Attentional Control in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Transport of choline via the neuronal high-affinity choline transporter (CHT; <I>SLC5A7</I>) is essential for cholinergic terminals to synthesize and release acetylcholine (ACh). In humans, we previously demonstrated an association between a common CHT coding substitution (rs1013940; Ile89Val) and reduced attentional control as well as attenuated frontal cortex activation. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate mice expressing the I89V substitution and assessed, <I>in vivo</I>, CHT-mediated choline transport, and ACh release. Relative to wild-type (WT) mice, CHT-mediated clearance of choline in male and female mice expressing one or two Val89 alleles was reduced by over 80% in cortex and over 50% in striatum. Choline clearance in CHT Val89 mice was further reduced by neuronal inactivation. Deficits in ACh release, 5 and 10 min after repeated depolarization at a low, behaviorally relevant frequency, support an attenuated reloading capacity of cholinergic neurons in mutant mice. The density of CHTs in total synaptosomal lysates and neuronal plasma-membrane-enriched fractions was not impacted by the Val89 variant, indicating a selective impact on CHT function. When challenged with a visual disruptor to reveal attentional control mechanisms, Val89 mice failed to adopt a more conservative response bias. Structural modeling revealed that Val89 may attenuate choline transport by altering conformational changes of CHT that support normal transport rates. Our findings support the view that diminished sustained cholinergic signaling capacity underlies perturbed attentional performance in individuals expressing CHT Val89. The CHT Val89 mouse serves as a valuable model to study heritable risk for cognitive disorders arising from cholinergic dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine (ACh) signaling depends on the functional capacity of the neuronal choline transporter (CHT). Previous research demonstrated that humans expressing the common CHT coding variant Val89 exhibit attentional vulnerabilities and attenuated fronto-cortical activation during attention. Here, we find that mice engineered to express the Val89 variant exhibit reduced CHT-mediated choline clearance and a diminished capacity to sustain ACh release. Additionally, Val89 mice lack cognitive flexibility in response to an attentional challenge. These findings provide a mechanistic and cognitive framework for interpreting the attentional phenotype associated with the human Val89 variant and establish a model that permits a more invasive interrogation of CNS effects as well as the development of therapeutic strategies for those, including Val89 carriers, with presynaptic cholinergic perturbations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altruism under Stress: Cortisol Negatively Predicts Charitable Giving and Neural Value Representations Depending on Mentalizing Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altruism, defined as costly other-regarding behavior, varies considerably across people and contexts. One prominent context in which people frequently must decide on how to socially act is under stress. How does stress affect altruistic decision-making and through which neurocognitive mechanisms? To address these questions, we assessed neural activity associated with charitable giving under stress. Human participants (males and females) completed a charitable donation task before and after they underwent either a psychosocial stressor or a control manipulation, while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. As the ability to infer other people's mental states (i.e., mentalizing) predicts prosocial giving and may be susceptible to stress, we examined whether stress effects on altruism depend on participants' general capacity to mentalize, as assessed in an independent task. Although our stress manipulation per se had no influence on charitable giving, increases in the stress hormone cortisol were associated with reductions in donations in participants with high mentalizing capacity, but not in low mentalizers. Multivariate neural response patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were less predictive of postmanipulation donations in high mentalizers with increased cortisol, indicating decreased value coding, and this effect mediated the (moderated) association between cortisol increases and reduced donations. Our findings provide novel insights into the modulation of altruistic decision-making by suggesting an impact of the stress hormone cortisol on mentalizing-related neurocognitive processes, which in turn results in decreased altruism. The DLPFC appears to play a key role in mediating this cortisol-related shift in altruism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altruism is a fundamental building block of our society. Emerging evidence indicates a major role of acute stress and stress-related neuromodulators in social behavior and decision-making. How and through which mechanisms stress may impact altruism remains elusive. We observed that the stress hormone cortisol was linked to diminished altruistic behavior. This effect was mediated by reduced value representations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and critically depended on the individual capacity to infer mental states of others. Our findings provide novel insights into the modulation of human altruism linked to stress-hormone dynamics and into the involved sociocognitive and neural mechanisms, with important implications for future developments of more targeted interventions for stress-related decrements in social behavior and social cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Related Enhancements in Positive Emotionality across The Life Span: Structural Equation Modeling of Brain and Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is associated with a bias in attention and memories toward positive and away from negative emotional content. In addition, emotion regulation appears to improve with age, despite concomitant widespread cognitive decline coupled with gray matter volume loss in cortical and subcortical regions thought to subserve emotion regulation. Here, we address this emotion-aging paradox using the behavioral data of an emotion regulation task from a population-derived, male and female, human sample (CamCAN) and use structural equation modeling together with multivariate analysis of structural MRI images of the same sample to investigate brain&ndash;behavior relationships. In a series of measurement models, we show the relationship between age and emotionality is best explained by a four-factor model, compared with single and hierarchical factor models. These four latent factors are interpreted as Basal Negative Affect, Positive Reactivity, Negative Reactivity and Positive Regulation (upregulating positive emotion to negative content). Increasing age uniquely contributes to increased Basal Negative Affect, Positive Reactivity, and Positive Regulation, but not Negative Reactivity. Furthermore, we show gray matter volumes, namely in the bilateral frontal operculum, medial frontal gyrus, bilateral hippocampal complex, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and bilateral angular gyrus, are distinctly related to these four latent factors. Finally, we show that a subset of these brain&ndash;behavior relationships remain significant when accounting for age and demographic data. Our results support the notion of an age-related increase in positivity and are interpreted in the context of the socioemotional selectivity theory of improved emotion regulation in older age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging is associated with a paradoxical increase in well-being and improved emotion regulation despite widespread cognitive decline and gray matter volume loss in neural regions that underlie emotion regulation. Using a population-derived sample, we test the theories behind this emotion/aging paradox with an emotion regulation task and structural MRI data. We report robust age-related increases in positivity across the life span and show structural neural integrity influences this relationship with increasing age. Several brain&ndash;behavior relationships remained unaffected by age and may represent empirically derived neural markers to explore the paradox of increased well-being in old age. The results support the predictions of socioemotional selectivity theory of improved emotion regulation in older age and challenge the amygdala-focused neural predictions of the aging brain model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Corticothalamic Circuit Trades off Speed for Safety during Decision-Making under Motivational Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decisions to act while pursuing goals in the presence of danger must be made quickly but safely. Premature decisions risk injury or death, whereas postponing decisions risk goal loss. Here we show how mice resolve these competing demands. Using microstructural behavioral analyses, we identified the spatiotemporal dynamics of approach&ndash;avoidance decisions under motivational conflict in male mice. Then we used cognitive modeling to show that these dynamics reflect the speeded decision-making mechanisms used by humans and nonhuman primates, with mice trading off decision speed for safety of choice when danger loomed. Using calcium imaging in paraventricular thalamus and optogenetic inhibition of the prelimbic cortex to paraventricular thalamus pathway, we show that this speed-safety trade off occurs because increases in paraventricular thalamus activity increase decision caution, thereby increasing approach&ndash;avoid decision times in the presence of danger. Our findings demonstrate that a discrete brain circuit involving the paraventricular thalamus and its prefrontal input adjusts decision caution during motivational conflict, trading off decision speed for decision safety when danger is close. We identify the corticothalamic pathway as central to cognitive control during decision-making under conflict.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Foraging animals balance the need to seek food and energy against the conflicting needs to avoid injury and predation. This competition is fundamental to survival but rarely has a stable, correct solution. Here we show that approach&ndash;avoid decisions under motivational conflict involve strategic adjustments in decision caution controlled via a top-down corticothalamic pathway from the prelimbic cortex to the paraventricular thalamus. We identify a novel corticothalamic mechanism for cognitive control that is applicable across a range of motivated behaviors and mark paraventricular thalamus and its prefrontal cortical input as targets to remediate the deficits in decision caution characteristic of unsafe and impulsive choices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal Cortical Connectivity Mediates Locus Coeruleus Noradrenergic Regulation of Inhibitory Control in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is a core executive function enabling adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Human and animal models indicate that inhibitory control and control networks are modulated by noradrenaline, arising from the locus coeruleus. The integrity (i.e., cellular density) of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system can be estimated from magnetization transfer (MT)-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in view of neuromelanin present in noradrenergic neurons of older adults. Noradrenergic psychopharmacological studies indicate noradrenergic modulation of prefrontal and frontostriatal stopping-circuits in association with behavioral change. Here, we test the noradrenergic hypothesis of inhibitory control, in healthy adults. We predicted that locus coeruleus integrity is associated with age-adjusted variance in response inhibition, mediated by changes in connectivity between frontal inhibitory control regions. In a preregistered analysis, we used MT MRI images from <I>N</I> = 63 healthy humans aged above 50 years (of either sex) who performed a Stop-Signal Task (SST), with atlas-based measurement of locus coeruleus contrast. We confirm that better response inhibition is correlated with locus coeruleus integrity and stronger connectivity between presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), but not volumes of the prefrontal cortical regions. We confirmed a significant role of prefrontal connectivity in mediating the effect of individual differences in the locus coeruleus on behavior, where this effect was moderated by age, over and above adjustment for the mean effects of age. Our results support the hypothesis that in normal populations, as in clinical settings, the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system regulates inhibitory control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that the integrity of the locus coeruleus, the principal source of cortical noradrenaline, is related to the efficiency of response inhibition in healthy older adults. This effect is in part mediated by its effect on functional connectivity in a prefrontal cortical stopping-network. The behavioral effect, and its mediation by connectivity, are moderated by age. This supports the psychopharmacological and genetic evidence for the noradrenergic regulation of behavioral control, in a population-based normative cohort. Noradrenergic treatment strategies may be effective to improve behavioral control in impulsive clinical populations, but age, and locus coeruleus integrity, are likely to be important stratification factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Sleep, Memory, and Cellular Pathological Features of Tauopathy, Including the NLRP3 Inflammasome, after Chronic Administration of Trazodone in rTg4510 Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several cellular pathways contribute to neurodegenerative tauopathy-related disorders. Microglial activation, a major component of neuroinflammation, is an early pathologic hallmark that correlates with cognitive decline, while the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributes to synaptic pathology. Sleep disturbances are prevalent in tauopathies and may also contribute to disease progression. Few studies have investigated whether manipulations of sleep influence cellular pathologic and behavioral features of tauopathy. We investigated whether trazodone, a licensed antidepressant with hypnotic efficacy in dementia, can reduce disease-related cellular pathways and improve memory and sleep in male rTg4510 mice with a tauopathy-like phenotype. In a 9 week dosing regimen, trazodone decreased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome expression and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase levels, which correlated with the NLRP3 inflammasome, the UPR effector ATF4, and total tau levels. Trazodone reduced theta oscillations during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and enhanced REM sleep duration. Olfactory memory transiently improved, and memory performance correlated with REM sleep duration and theta oscillations. These findings on the effects of trazodone on the NLRP3 inflammasome, the unfolded protein response and behavioral hallmarks of dementia warrant further studies on the therapeutic value of sleep-modulating compounds for tauopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dementia and associated behavioral symptoms such as memory loss and sleep disturbance are debilitating. Identifying treatments that alleviate symptoms and concurrently target cellular pathways contributing to disease progression is paramount for the patients and their caregivers. Here we show that a chronic treatment with trazodone, an antidepressant with positive effects on sleep, has beneficial effects on several cellular pathways contributing to neuroinflammation and tau pathology, in tauopathy-like rTg4510 mice. Trazodone also improved rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the slowing of brain oscillations, and olfactory memory disturbances, which are all early symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, trazodone and compounds with REM sleep-promoting properties may represent a promising treatment approach to reduce the early symptoms of tauopathy and slow down disease progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Predicting the functional impact of KCNQ1 variants with artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Saksham Phul, Georg Kuenze, Carlos G. Vanoye, Charles R. Sanders, Alfred L. George Jr., Jens Meiler</p>

Recent advances in experimental and computational protein structure determination have provided access to high-quality structures for most human proteins and mutants thereof. However, linking changes in structure in protein mutants to functional impact remains an active area of method development. If successful, such methods can ultimately assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment decisions. This work presents three artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive models that classify four key functional parameters of KCNQ1 variants as normal or dysfunctional using PSSM-based evolutionary and/or biophysical descriptors. Recent advances in predicting protein structure and variant properties with artificial intelligence (AI) rely heavily on the availability of evolutionary features and thus fail to directly assess the biophysical underpinnings of a change in structure and/or function. The central goal of this work was to develop an ANN model based on structure and physiochemical properties of KCNQ1 potassium channels that performs comparably or better than algorithms using only on PSSM-based evolutionary features. These biophysical features highlight the structure-function relationships that govern protein stability, function, and regulation. The input sensitivity algorithm incorporates the roles of hydrophobicity, polarizability, and functional densities on key functional parameters of the KCNQ1 channel. Inclusion of the biophysical features outperforms exclusive use of PSSM-based evolutionary features in predicting activation voltage dependence and deactivation time. As AI is increasing applied to problems in biology, biophysical understanding will be critical with respect to ‘explainable AI’, i.e., understanding the relation of sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Our model is available at www.kcnq1predict.org.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">BioCRNpyler: Compiling chemical reaction networks from biomolecular parts in diverse contexts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Poole, Ayush Pandey, Andrey Shur, Zoltan A. Tuza, Richard M. Murray</p>

Biochemical interactions in systems and synthetic biology are often modeled with chemical reaction networks (CRNs). CRNs provide a principled modeling environment capable of expressing a huge range of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a software toolbox, written in Python, that compiles high-level design specifications represented using a modular library of biochemical parts, mechanisms, and contexts to CRN implementations. This compilation process offers four advantages. First, the building of the actual CRN representation is automatic and outputs Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models compatible with numerous simulators. Second, a library of modular biochemical components allows for different architectures and implementations of biochemical circuits to be represented succinctly with design choices propagated throughout the underlying CRN automatically. This prevents the often occurring mismatch between high-level designs and model dynamics. Third, high-level design specification can be embedded into diverse biomolecular environments, such as cell-free extracts and <i>in vivo</i> milieus. Finally, our software toolbox has a parameter database, which allows users to rapidly prototype large models using very few parameters which can be customized later. By using BioCRNpyler, users ranging from expert modelers to novice script-writers can easily build, manage, and explore sophisticated biochemical models using diverse biochemical implementations, environments, and modeling assumptions.

Accurate discovery of somatic mutations in a cell is a challenge that partially lays in immaturity of dedicated analytical approaches. Approaches comparing a cell’s genome to a control bulk sample miss common mutations, while approaches to find such mutations from bulk suffer from low sensitivity. We developed a tool, All<sup>2</sup>, which enables accurate filtering of mutations in a cell without the need for data from bulk(s). It is based on pair-wise comparisons of all cells to each other where every call for base pair substitution and indel is classified as either a germline variant, mosaic mutation, or false positive. As All<sup>2</sup> allows for considering dropped-out regions, it is applicable to whole genome and exome analysis of cloned and amplified cells. By applying the approach to a variety of available data, we showed that its application reduces false positives, enables sensitive discovery of high frequency mutations, and is indispensable for conducting high resolution cell lineage tracing.

The design of vaccines against highly mutable pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, requires a detailed understanding of how the adaptive immune system responds to encountering multiple variant antigens (Ags). Here, we describe a multiscale model of B cell receptor (BCR) affinity maturation that employs actual BCR nucleotide sequences and treats BCR/Ag interactions in atomistic detail. We apply the model to simulate the maturation of a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against HIV. Starting from a germline precursor sequence of the VRC01 anti-HIV Ab, we simulate BCR evolution in response to different vaccination protocols and different Ags, which were previously designed by us. The simulation results provide qualitative guidelines for future vaccine design and reveal unique insights into bnAb evolution against the CD4 binding site of HIV. Our model makes possible direct comparisons of simulated BCR populations with results of deep sequencing data, which will be explored in future applications.

                <p>by Meriem Mekedem, Patrice Ravel, Jacques Colinge</p>

The development of high-throughput genomic technologies associated with recent genetic perturbation techniques such as short hairpin RNA (shRNA), gene trapping, or gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) has made it possible to obtain large perturbation data sets. These data sets are invaluable sources of information regarding the function of genes, and they offer unique opportunities to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks in specific cell types. Modular response analysis (MRA) is a well-accepted mathematical modeling method that is precisely aimed at such network inference tasks, but its use has been limited to rather small biological systems so far. In this study, we show that MRA can be employed on large systems with almost 1,000 network components. In particular, we show that MRA performance surpasses general-purpose mutual information-based algorithms. Part of these competitive results was obtained by the application of a novel heuristic that pruned MRA-inferred interactions <i>a posteriori</i>. We also exploited a block structure in MRA linear algebra to parallelize large system resolutions.

     alt="Altered basal ganglia infraslow oscillation and resting functional connectivity in complex regional pain syndrome"/>
<p>This study is the first systematic evaluation of functional connectivity of basal ganglia motor and non-motor territories in CRPS. In CRPS, there is increased ISOs and resting functional connectivity in motor but not in non-motor basal ganglia territories (except caudate body functional connectivity) compared to controls.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition commonly accompanied by movement disturbances and often affects the upper limbs. The basal ganglia motor loop is central to movement, however, non-motor basal ganglia loops are involved in pain, sensory integration, visual processing, cognition, and emotion. Systematic evaluation of each basal ganglia functional loop and its relation to motor and non-motor disturbances in CRPS has not been investigated. We recruited 15 upper limb CRPS and 45 matched healthy control subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, infraslow oscillations (ISO) and resting-state functional connectivity in motor and non-motor basal ganglia loops were investigated using putamen and caudate seeds. Compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased ISO power in the putamen contralateral to the CRPS affected limb, specifically, in contralateral putamen areas representing the supplementary motor area hand, motor hand, and motor tongue. Furthermore, compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased resting connectivity between these putaminal areas as well as from the caudate body to cortical areas such as the primary motor cortex, supplementary and cingulate motor areas, parietal association areas, and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate changes in basal ganglia loop function in CRPS subjects and may underpin motor disturbances of CRPS.</p>

                The blood–brain barrier (BBB) continues to represent one of the most significant challenges for successful drug-based treatments of neurological disease. Mechanical modulation of the BBB using focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MBs) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the brain, but questions remain regarding possible long-term effects of such forced disruption. This review examines the evidence for inflammation associated with ultrasound-induced BBB disruption and potential strategies for managing such inflammatory effects to improve both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic ultrasound in neurological applications.

                Neural responses to vocalizations are expected to depend on the sensory features of the stimulus.

                The peripheral autonomic nervous system (PANS) functions to maintain homeostasis of the internal body environment. Dysregulation of the PANS alters the functions of the cardiovascular, genito-urinary, skin, and gastrointestinal systems. Dysautonomia can occur independently or in coincidence with other diseases, such as synucleinopathies. Despite similar manifestations across many conditions, research points to a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms involving development, malfunction, and neurodegeneration.
