              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05505">Rewiring Human Brain Networks via Lightweight Dynamic Connectivity Framework: An EEG-Based Stress Validation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05517">Stable non-minimal fixed points of threshold-linear networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $\tau \subsetneq \sigma$ for which $|\tau| = i$ and $|\sigma| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.

                arXiv:2511.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the use of persistent homology- specifically Betti curves for brain age prediction and for distinguishing between healthy and pathological aging. The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05531">Selection and Stability of Functional Connectivity Features for Classification of Brain Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05536">Gravity-Awareness: Deep Learning Models and LLM Simulation of Human Awareness in Altered Gravity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05542">ConnectomeBench: Can LLMs Proofread the Connectome?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

                arXiv:2511.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current neuroimaging studies on neurodegenerative diseases and psychological risk factors have been developed predominantly in non Hispanic White cohorts, with other populations markedly underrepresented. In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.

Abstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.

Abstract: Graph-theoretical labeling provides a rigorous mathematical framework for characterizing the structural and functional organization of complex networks. This paper investigates the application of cordial labeling and signed product cordial labeling to brain connectivity graphs, emphasizing their relevance to small-world network models in neuroscience. The cordial condition is interpreted as a measure of structural balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal interactions, while the signed product cordial labeling reflects the coexistence of cooperative and antagonistic neural dynamics.

This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.

Abstract: Functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) are key multimodal biomarkers for brain analysis, yet their clinical utility is hindered by costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and frequent missing modalities. Existing foundation models either process single modalities or lack explicit mechanisms for cross-modal and cross-scale consistency. We propose BrainCSD, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) foundation model that jointly synthesizes FC/SC biomarkers and supports downstream decoding tasks (diagnosis and prediction). BrainCSD features three neuroanatomically grounded components: (1) a ROI-specific MoE that aligns regional activations from canonical networks (e.g., DMN, FPN) with a global atlas via contrastive consistency; (2) a Encoding-Activation MOE that models dynamic cross-time/gradient dependencies in fMRI/dMRI; and (3) a network-aware refinement MoE that enforces structural priors and symmetry at individual and population levels. Evaluated on the datasets under complete and missing-modality settings, BrainCSD achieves SOTA results: 95.6\% accuracy for MCI vs. CN classification without FC, low synthesis error (FC RMSE: 0.038; SC RMSE: 0.006), brain age prediction (MAE: 4.04 years), and MMSE score estimation (MAE: 1.72 points).

                arXiv:2511.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.

                arXiv:2511.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks, the building blocks of AI, were inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data. The results suggest the presence of a subspace in LLMs focused on capturing part-of-speech tag concepts, resembling patterns observed in lesion studies of the brain in neuroscience.

                arXiv:2511.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior is a central goal of neuroscience. Despite significant advances, a fundamental dichotomy persists: neural activity manifests as both discrete spikes of individual neurons and collective waves of populations. Both neural codes correlate with behavior, yet correlation alone cannot determine whether waves exert a causal influence or merely reflect spiking dynamics without causal efficacy. According to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, no amount of observational data--however extensive--can settle this question; causal conclusions require explicit structural assumptions or careful experiment designs that directly correspond to the causal effect of interest. We develop a formal framework that makes this limitation precise and constructive. Formalizing epiphenomenality via the invariance of interventional distributions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we derive a certificate of sufficiency from Pearl's do-calculus that specifies when variables can be removed from the model without loss of causal explainability and clarifies how interventions should be interpreted under different causal structures of spike-wave duality. The purpose of this work is not to resolve the spike-wave debate, but to reformulate it. We shift the problem from asking which signal matters most to asking under what conditions any signal can be shown to matter at all. This reframing distinguishes prediction from explanation and offers neuroscience a principled route for deciding when waves belong to mechanism and when they constitute a byproduct of underlying coordination

                arXiv:2511.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.

                arXiv:2511.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.

                arXiv:2511.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.

                arXiv:2505.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

                arXiv:2511.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous growth of the number of end-of-life vehicles and the rapid increase in the ownership of pure electric vehicles, the automobile disassembly industry is facing the challenge of transitioning from the traditional fuel vehicles to the mixed disassembly of fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles. In order to cope with the uncertainty of recycling quantity and the demand of mixed-model disassembly of multiple vehicle types, this paper designs a multi-parallel mixed-model disassembly line (MPMDL), and constructs a corresponding mixed-integer planning model for the equilibrium optimization problem of this disassembly line with the optimization objectives of the minimum number of workstations, the minimum fatigue level of workers and the minimum energy consumption. Combining the differences in disassembly processes between fuel vehicles and pure electric vehicles, an improved non-dominated sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) based on the distribution of feasible solutions and dynamic search resource allocation is designed to solve this multi-objective dynamic balance optimization problem, and the two-stage dynamic adjustment strategy is adopted to realize the adaptive adjustment of the disassembly line under the uncertainty of the recycling quantity, and, recently, arithmetic validation is carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the resource utilization efficiency, reduce energy consumption, alleviate the workers' load, and provide multiple high-quality disassembly solutions under the multi-objective trade-off. Compared with mainstream multi-objective optimization algorithms, the INSGA-III algorithm shows significant advantages in terms of solution quality, convergence and stability. This study provides a green, efficient and flexible solution for hybrid disassembly of fuel and pure electric vehicles.

                arXiv:2511.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's spike-based computation, spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently possess temporal activation sparsity. However, when it comes to the sparse training of SNNs in the structural connection domain, existing methods fail to achieve ultra-sparse network structures without significant performance loss, thereby hindering progress in energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. This limitation presents a critical challenge: how to achieve high levels of structural connection sparsity while maintaining performance comparable to fully connected networks. To address this challenge, we propose the Cannistraci-Hebb Spiking Neural Network (CH-SNN), a novel and generalizable dynamic sparse training framework for SNNs consisting of four stages. First, we propose a sparse spike correlated topological initialization (SSCTI) method to initialize a sparse network based on node correlations. Second, temporal activation sparsity and structural connection sparsity are integrated via a proposed sparse spike weight initialization (SSWI) method. Third, a hybrid link removal score (LRS) is applied to prune redundant weights and inactive neurons, improving information flow. Finally, the CH3-L3 network automaton framework inspired by Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory is incorporated to perform link prediction for potential synaptic regrowth. These mechanisms enable CH-SNN to achieve sparsification across all linear layers. We have conducted extensive experiments on six datasets including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, evaluating various network architectures such as spiking convolutional neural networks and Spikformer.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of socio-cognitive mutation operators inspired by the TOPSIS method to the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS) problem. Traditional evolutionary algorithms, while effective, often suffer from premature convergence and poor exploration-exploitation balance. To address these challenges, we introduce socio-cognitive mutation mechanisms that integrate strategies of following the best solutions and avoiding the worst. By guiding search agents to imitate high-performing solutions and avoid poor ones, these operators enhance both solution diversity and convergence efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TOPSIS-inspired mutation outperforms the base algorithm in optimizing LABS sequences. The study highlights the potential of socio-cognitive learning principles in evolutionary computation and suggests directions for further refinement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05815">Parametric Pareto Set Learning for Expensive Multi-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric multi-objective optimization (PMO) addresses the challenge of solving an infinite family of multi-objective optimization problems, where optimal solutions must adapt to varying parameters. Traditional methods require re-execution for each parameter configuration, leading to prohibitive costs when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Parametric Pareto Set Learning with multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (PPSL-MOBO), a novel framework that learns a unified mapping from both preferences and parameters to Pareto-optimal solutions. PPSL-MOBO leverages a hypernetwork with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently capture parametric variations, while integrating Gaussian process surrogates and hypervolume-based acquisition to minimize expensive function evaluations. We demonstrate PPSL-MOBO's effectiveness on two challenging applications: multi-objective optimization with shared components, where certain design variables must be identical across solution families due to modular constraints, and dynamic multi-objective optimization, where objectives evolve over time. Unlike existing methods that cannot directly solve PMO problems in a unified manner, PPSL-MOBO learns a single model that generalizes across the entire parameter space. By enabling instant inference of Pareto sets for new parameter values without retraining, PPSL-MOBO provides an efficient solution for expensive PMO problems.

                arXiv:2511.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline data-driven Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOPs) rely on limited data from simulations, experiments, or sensors. This scarcity leads to high epistemic uncertainty in surrogate predictions. Conventional surrogate methods such as Kriging assume Gaussian distributions, which can yield suboptimal results when the assumptions fail. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet novel dual-ranking strategy, working with a basic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, where the built-in non-dominated sorting is kept and the second rank is devised for uncertainty estimation. In the latter, we utilize the uncertainty estimates given by several surrogate models, including Quantile Regression (QR), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Concretely, with this dual-ranking strategy, each solution's final rank is the average of its non-dominated sorting rank and a rank derived from the uncertainty-adjusted fitness function, thus reducing the risk of misguided optimization under data constraints. We evaluate our approach on benchmark and real-world MOPs, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our dual-ranking strategy significantly improves the performance of NSGA-II in offline settings, achieving competitive outcomes compared with traditional surrogate-based methods. This framework advances uncertainty-aware multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, offering a robust solution for data-limited, real-world applications.

                arXiv:2511.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired computation but remain underexplored for continuous regression tasks in scientific machine learning. In this work, we introduce and systematically evaluate Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons as an alternative to the conventional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model in both directly trained SNNs and ANN-to-SNN conversion frameworks. The QIF neuron exhibits smooth and differentiable spiking dynamics, enabling gradient-based training and stable optimization within architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Across benchmarks on function approximation, operator learning, and partial differential equation (PDE) solving, QIF-based networks yield smoother, more accurate, and more stable predictions than their LIF counterparts, which suffer from discontinuous time-step responses and jagged activation surfaces. These results position the QIF neuron as a computational bridge between spiking and continuous-valued deep learning, advancing the integration of neuroscience-inspired dynamics into physics-informed and operator-learning frameworks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07125">Towards a Rigorous Understanding of the Population Dynamics of the NSGA-III: Tight Runtime Bounds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving multi-objective optimization problems. A prominent example is NSGA-III, which is particularly well suited for solving problems involving more than three objectives, distinguishing it from the classical NSGA-II. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of NSGA III remains very limited, especially with respect to runtime analysis. A central open problem concerns its population dynamics, which involve controlling the maximum number of individuals sharing the same fitness value during the exploration process. In this paper, we make a significant step towards such an understanding by proving tight runtime bounds for NSGA-III on the bi-objective OneMinMax ($2$-OMM) problem. Firstly, we prove that NSGA-III requires $\Omega(n^2 \log(n) / \mu)$ generations in expectation to optimize $2$-OMM assuming the population size $\mu$ satisfies $n+1 \leq \mu =O(\log(n)^c(n+1))$ where $n$ denotes the problem size and $c<1$ is a constant. Apart from~\cite{opris2025multimodal}, this is the first proven lower runtime bound for NSGA-III on a classical benchmark problem. Complementing this, we secondly improve the best known upper bound of NSGA-III on the $m$-objective OneMinMax problem ($m$-OMM) of $O(n \log(n))$ generations by a factor of $\mu /(2n/m + 1)^{m/2}$ for a constant number $m$ of objectives and population size $(2n/m + 1)^{m/2} \leq \mu \in O(\sqrt{\log(n)} (2n/m + 1)^{m/2})$. This yields tight runtime bounds in the case $m = 2$, and the surprising result that NSGA-III beats NSGA-II by a factor of $\mu/n$ in the expected runtime.

                arXiv:2511.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II, the SPEA2 is one of the most widely used domination-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\mu \ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\lambda$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\lambda+\mu)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\mu = \Theta(n)$ and $\lambda = O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\mu, \lambda = O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.

                arXiv:2511.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $\gamma$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$\gamma$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $\gamma \approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

Abstract: Swarm based optimization algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems. However, their widespread adoption remains sceptical due to limited transparency in how different algorithmic components influence the overall performance of the algorithm. This work presents a multi-faceted interpretability related investigations of one of the popular swarm algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization. Through this work, we provide a framework that makes the role of different topologies and parameters in PSO interpretable and explainable using novel machine learning approach. We first developed a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features in the problem that affects the optimization performance of PSO. Secondly, we rigorously compare three topologies - Ring, Star, and Von Neumann analyzing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behavior, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO. The work successfully decodes how swarm topologies affect information flow, diversity, and convergence. Through systematic experimentation across 24 benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings uncover the black-box nature of PSO, providing more transparency and interpretability to swarm intelligence systems.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) learning algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise "goodness" function with well-designed negative samples for contrastive learning. Existing goodness functions are typically defined as the sum of squared postsynaptic activations, neglecting correlated variability between neurons. In this work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for noisy copies of individual inputs while maximizing it across the sample distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare negative samples.We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference when predictions are derived from the mean of squared output, which is equivalent to making predictions based on an energy term. Our findings contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

                arXiv:2507.13659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained GPT-2 Small models, examining these universal neurons-neurons with consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at five checkpoints, we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions, measured via cross entropy loss. Additionally, we quantify neuron persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training checkpoints, particularly in early and deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and universal representational structures emerge during language model training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.

                <p>Identifying neural signatures of slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for a number of reasons including diagnosing potential sleep disorders and examining its role in memory consolidation (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B13">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Klinzing et al., 2019</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B4">Brodt et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Studies of sleep in the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) have revealed similarities to humans and other nonhuman primates, including distinct sleep stages (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B11">Crofts et al., 2001</cross-ref>) and diurnal sleep patterns (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Hoffmann et al., 2012</cross-ref>). Advances in applying wireless technology for recording neural activity during natural, unrestrained behaviors (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Walker et al., 2021</cross-ref>) position the marmoset as an excellent model for studying sleep-related neural activity associated with learning. Here, we identify putative SWS epochs based on the spatially correlated activity of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from a multielectrode planar array implanted in the sensorimotor cortex of two marmosets (one female and one male). The average correlation of the LFP signal measured between electrodes decreased gradually with the distance between pairs. We modeled this spatial structure as an exponential decay function, where the spatial decay constant varied significantly over time, reaching its lowest values during epochs where LFP power dynamics were consistent with SWS. These periods of widespread high correlations across the sensorimotor cortex closely matched SWS identification commonly used in rodent models based on the changes in power in the gamma (30&ndash;60&nbsp;Hz) and delta/slow oscillation (0.1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) frequency bands. These findings demonstrate that putative SWS epochs can be reliably identified using spatially correlated LFP activity across the sensorimotor cortex.</p>

                <p>Listening effort reflects the cognitive and motivational resources allocated to speech comprehension, particularly under challenging conditions. Visual cues are known to enhance speech perception, potentially by reducing the cognitive demands of the task. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this facilitation, especially in terms of effort-related changes, remain unclear. In this study, we combined pupillometry and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate how visual speech cues modulate cognitive effort during speech recognition. Twenty-two participants (seven females) performed a speech-in-noise task under three modalities: (1) auditory-only, (2) audiovisual, and (3) visual-only. Task difficulty was manipulated via signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the first two modalities. Firstly, we found an inverted U-shape relationship between pupil dilation and frontal midline theta with SNR for audiovisual and auditory-only speech, consistent with prior models of effort allocation. Secondly, we observed the SNR at which the neurophysiological measures peaked was at a lower SNR for audiovisual speech. Surprisingly, we found pupil dilation to be larger overall in audiovisual speech, while frontal midline theta did not show differences in either modality. These findings highlight the complexity of interpreting physiological markers of effort and suggest that visual cues may alter the temporal dynamics or resource allocation strategies during speech processing. Our results support the extension of auditory-based models of listening effort to audiovisual contexts and underscore the value of integrating multimodal neurophysiological measures to better understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms of effortful listening.</p>

                The slender walking catfish, Prophagorus nieuhofii, plays an important role in small-scale fisheries across Southeast Asia, supporting food security. While IUCN currently lists it as a Least Concern species, growing demand and pressures such as overfishing, habitat loss, and degradation may elevate its conservation risk. To support sustainable fisheries management and aquaculture, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the whole genome of this species. The specimen was part of an expedition to document and preserve the genetic resources of aquatic animals in Kalimantan’s freshwater ecosystems. Using 27 Gb of sequence data, we assembled a 1.1 Gb genome comprising 5,790 scaffolds. This genome assembly has high contiguity and completeness, with N50 of 33.7 Mb and a BUSCO score of 98.8%. Repeat annotation revealed that 48.17% of the genome consisted of repetitive elements, predominantly DNA transposons (18.56%) and retroelements (13.30%). Structural annotation identified 30,099 protein-coding genes and 37,734 transcripts, most of which were multi-exonic and rich in alternative splicing. BUSCO analysis confirmed the high completeness of the genome and annotation, with 97.7% of the conserved orthologs being detected.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides valuable insights into cell biology. However, current scRNA-Seq analytic approaches do not distinguish between spliced and unspliced mRNA at the level of dimensionality reduction. RNA velocity paradigms suggest that the presence of unspliced mRNA reflects transitional cell states, informative for studies of dynamic processes such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Alternatively, stable cell subsets may also maintain translationally repressed spliced mRNA in processing bodies (P-bodies) and/or unspliced mRNA reservoirs for prompt initiation of transcription-independent expression. To enable splicing-aware analysis of scRNA-Seq data, we developed a method called SANSARA (Splicing-Aware scrNa-Seq AppRoAch). We employed SANSARA to characterize peripheral blood regulatory T cell (T<sub>reg</sub>) subsets, revealing a complementary interplay between the FoxP3 and Helios master transcription factors and upregulation of functionally relevant <i>IL10RA</i>, <i>LGALS3</i>, <i>FCRL3</i>, <i>CD38</i>, <i>ITGAL</i>, and <i>LEF1</i> spliced gene forms in effector T<sub>reg</sub>s. Among Th1 and cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, SANSARA also revealed substantial splicing heterogeneity across subset-specific genes. SANSARA is straightforward to implement in current data analysis pipelines and opens new dimensions for scRNA-Seq-based discoveries.

In the field of Plant Protection Products (PPP), the combination of multiple active ingredients is a common strategy to improve the efficacy against target species. However, these mixtures may expose non-target species to untested chemical combinations due to varied application and degradation pathways. Developing a method to predict the effects of such mixtures without extensive testing is crucial for enhancing risk assessment for non-target organisms. Toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) models currently provide predictive power for the toxicity of mixture over time, utilizing the concentration addition and independent action principles. However, their capacity to capture complex, non-linear interactions - such as synergistic and antagonistic effects - remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new methodology that integrates TKTD models using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) with neural networks (NN), offering a robust framework for modeling complex substance interactions. The ODE component encodes fundamental biological principles that constrain the neural network to biologically plausible solutions. Bayesian inference further refines the model by addressing uncertainties in data, model parameters, and biological processes, while also allowing quantification of prediction uncertainty, highlighting gaps in experimental data that warrant further investigation. This hybrid model was evaluated across 99 acute toxicity studies that included various PPP mixtures, testing its ability to identify and forecast deviations from expected mixture behaviors. Our findings demonstrate that while simpler linear models provide a robust and parsimonious baseline for predicting additive mixture effects, the neural network component serves as a powerful tool for selectively identifying and forecasting significant non-linear deviations from these expectations. This dual approach clarifies the distinct roles of both simple and complex models, providing a more responsible framework to anticipate the combined effects of untested chemical mixtures and inform risk assessment practices.

The homeostasis of intracellular inorganic phosphate is essential for eukaryotic metabolism and is regulated by the INPHORS signalling pathway, which employs inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) as key intermediary messengers. This study investigates the metabolic pathways of inositol pyrophosphates (IPPs) in the yeast cell line ΔSPX and the human tumor cell line HCT116. Utilizing pulse-labelling experiments with <sup>18</sup>O water and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore the synthesis and turnover of the highly phosphorylated IPP, 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub>. Our findings challenge the notion that 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> can be synthesized through distinct routes, revealing a linear reaction sequence in both systems. Employing model reduction via the profile likelihood method, we achieved statistically concise identifiability analysis that led to significant biological insights. In yeast, we determined that 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> production primarily occurs through the phosphorylation of 5-InsP<sub>7</sub>, with the pathway involving 1-InsP<sub>7</sub> deemed unnecessary as its removal did not compromise model accuracy. Crucially, this prediction of altered IPP concentrations was validated experimentally in <i>vip1</i>Δ and <i>kcs1</i>Δ knockout strains, providing orthogonal biological support for the reduced model. In HCT116 cells, 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis is mainly driven by 1-InsP<sub>7</sub>, with variations observed across different experimental conditions. These results underscore the utility of model reduction in enhancing our understanding of metabolic pathways, coupling predictive modeling with experimental validation, and providing a framework for future investigations into the regulation and implications of linear IPP pathways in eukaryotic cells.

Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. However, translating high-dimensional data into functional pathway insights remains challenging. To address this obstacle, we developed PaaSc (Pathway activity analysis of Single-cell), a computational method for inferring pathway activity at single-cell resolution. PaaSc employs multiple correspondence analysis to simultaneously project cells and genes into a common latent space and selects pathway-associated dimensions through linear regression to infer pathway activity scores. We validated PaaSc across diverse benchmarking datasets, including those that jointly profiled protein and RNA levels, as well as large-scale cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, PaaSc demonstrated superior performance in multiple applications: scoring cell type-specific gene sets, identifying cell senescence-associated pathways, and exploring GWAS trait-associated cell types. Importantly, PaaSc maintained accuracy despite batch effects and demonstrated robust performance across different data modalities, including scATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. Our results demonstrate that PaaSc accurately captures dynamic cellular states and spatial patterns, thereby advancing our understanding of cellular dynamics, aging, and disease mechanisms.

                <p>by Turner Silverthorne, Matthew Carlucci, Arturas Petronis, Adam R. Stinchcombe</p>

Equally spaced temporal sampling is the standard protocol for the study of biological rhythms. These equispaced designs perform well when calibrated to an oscillator’s period, yet can introduce systematic biases when applied to rhythms of unknown periodicity. Here, we investigate how optimizing the timing of measurements can improve rhythm detection across a range of experimental settings. When the period of a rhythm is known, we prove that equispaced designs provide optimal statistical power. In studies targeting specific sets of candidate rhythms, we construct optimal alternatives to equispaced designs to simultaneously maximize power at all frequencies under consideration. For studies investigating continuous period ranges, we show numerically how blindspots near the Nyquist rate can be resolved through timing optimization. Our computational methods are available through our PowerCHORD library. Our findings across all experimental contexts suggest that timing optimization is an effective yet under-explored tool for improving biological rhythm discovery.

                <p>by Hui Liu, Jiani Ma, Xianjun Ma, Lin Zhang</p>

Identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites with a reasonable biological explanation has important implications for the treatment of diseases. Due to the limitations of in vitro experiments in identifying pathogenic RNA methylation sites, there is a growing need for computational workflows to enable accurate inference. Here, motivated by this profound meaning, we developed PathoRM, a biologically informed deep learning model, to infer associations between RNA methylation sites and diseases. PathoRM could provide convincing pathogenic RNA methylation sites and unravel the enigma of pathology in the epi-transcriptomic layer. PathoRM fuses RNA methylation host sequences and pathogenic descriptions as inputs, and subsequently employs large language models, multi-view learning algorithm, graph neural networks, an adversarial training approach, and “guilty-by-association”-derived negative sampling approach. PathoRM distils the semantically enriched feature embeddings, leading to more accurate and robust prediction performance across the metrics and datasets. Notably, incorporated with attention mechanism, PathoRM bestows itself biological interpretability through illuminating the dark matters in the host sequences of RNA methylation sites. This work is expected to assist in the discovery of pathogenic RNA methylation sites and conserved motifs, contributing to the advancement of genome research. Codes and pre-trained model are accessible at https://github.com/jianiM/PathoRM.

                <p>by Josune Imaz-Iruretagoyena, Maite Blanco-Urrejola, Irene Núñez-García, Irene García-Toledo, Luis C. Fernández-Beltrán, Mar Márquez, Silvia Corrochano, Amanda Sierra, Jimena Baleriola</p>

Polarized cells in the brain, such as neurons and glia, rely on the asymmetric distribution of their proteins compartmentalizing the function of dendrites, axons, glial projections, and endfeet. Subcellular proteomes can be assembled either by the transport of proteins synthesized in the cell soma or by the delivery of mRNAs to target compartments where they are locally translated into proteins. This latter mechanism is known as local protein synthesis or local translation, and it has been best studied in neurons. Increasing evidence suggests it is also required to maintain local protein homeostasis in glial cells; however, in microglia, local translation remains largely unexplored. Given the scant evidence, we aimed at exploring the existence of local translation in peripheral microglial processes (PeMPs) and unraveling its functional significance. We report that local translation indeed happens in PeMPs, and it is enhanced by triggering a microglial inflammatory response with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) suggesting a functional relevance of this molecular mechanism in response to inflammation. We found that <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarizes to PeMPs and is locally translated upon LPS exposure. Interestingly, downregulation of the <i>Actb</i>-binding protein IMP1/ZBP1 impaired <i>Actb</i> mRNA polarization and its localized translation, and led to defects in filopodia distribution, PeMP motility, lamellar directed migration, and phagocytosis in microglia. Thus, our work contributes to recent findings that mRNA localization and localized translation occur in microglia and gives a mechanistic insight into the relevance of this molecular mechanism in fundamental microglial functions in response to inflammation.

                We are living in an era of rapid transformation in the technology sector, where success depends on shifting from traditional static strategies to dynamic models that emphasize strategic agility and real-time decision making as shown in Figure 1. Despite ongoing digital transformation, a critical gap remains in understanding how predictive Artificial Intelligence (AI) and electronic Human Resource Management (e-HRM) tools integrate into policy frameworks that future-proof organizations against disruption. This systematic literature review provides an evidence-based analysis of how digital AI and e-HRM platforms can be utilized to enhance strategic agility and real-time decision making in the technology industry. Through qualitative and thematic synthesis analysis of studies published between 2015 and 2025, the review finds that AI and e-HRM significantly strengthen strategic agility. However, challenges such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, integration difficulties, and resistance to AI adoption may limit scalability and ethical use. While AI-driven tools offer strong potential for improving agility, addressing ethical, technical, and organizational challenges is crucial to fully realize their benefits. The findings highlight the need for policies supporting ethical AI practices, robust data governance, and workforce readiness to ensure effective integration of AI tools and strengthen organizational agility and real time decision-making.

                Achievement goal orientation theory has become popular, as it interprets students’ academic attitudes and behavior. The present research aims to investigate the variation in teachers’ perceived goals in relation to achievement goals in different grades, as well as the emergence of the multiple goal theory. Participants were junior high school students who responded to a self-report questionnaire. The instrument used was the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS). The results revealed that mastery and performance goals behave as a network of interacting variables that essentially represent their coexistence, as well as their individual variations and specificities in relation to other variables. However, a significant distinction between mastery goals and perceived mastery goals with performance goals and perceived performance goals became apparent for each individual grade. The present research contributes to the theoretical development of the field, while in practice it highlights the combination of goals in school reality.

                Background The CRM nacelle is a benchmark model for both CFD validation and shock dominated flow interaction analysis in propulsion airframe configurations. However, accurate prediction of drag and lift remains challenging due to complex flow interaction near the nacelle surface. Methods This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of a CRM nacelle using the ANSYS 2023 Fluent tool with different numerical techniques like the grid independence test, different turbulence models, and different Mach number variations. Results At Mach 0.85, the nacelle with a fan and a 1.64 million grid size produced a Cd of 0.00245 with a 1.24% error. Similarly, out of six different models, the K-epsilon model produced the least validation error of 1.24%. Mach number variation from 0.8 to 1.3 Mach number shown a maximum Cd at 0.95 Mach followed by a decrement at 1.2 Mach. In the aerodynamic optimization, a core cone was added to the nacelle and further simulated at 0.82 Mach. Spalart-Allmara model with a 2.55 million grid size produced a Cl value of 0.01098 with an 8.54% validation error. The cone angles were varied from 15.7° by ±0.5° steps. Conclusions The optimized nacelle at a 13.7°cone angle showed an improved Cl of 0.011035 compared to the baseline model. The novelty of this research lies in testing the CRM nacelle under transonic flow conditions from 0.8 to 1.3 Mach and optimizing the nacelle aerodynamic performance using different numerical techniques. This research paper further helps the researchers in nacelle aerodynamics by optimizing the nacelle geometry for aerodynamic lift enhancement.

                The high performance computing (HPC) community is in a period of transition. The rise of AI/ML coupled with a changing landscape of resources deems portability a new metric of performance, and methods to move between on-premises and cloud environments and assess compatibility are paramount. Here we design and test a strategy for bridging the gap between traditional HPC and Kubernetes environments – first containerizing applications, providing automated orchestration to run studies, and packaging the setup with automated means to assess performance using low overhead eXtended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs. We first assess different designs for eBPF collection, demonstrating a tradeoff between number of programs deployed on a node and overhead added. We develop 5 low overhead eBPF programs that combine with streaming ML models to assess CPU, futex, TCP, shared memory, and file access across four different builds of an HPC application for CPU and GPU. We use eBPF data to generate insights into the possible underlying etiology of scaling issues. We then assess compatibility of a well-known benchmark, HPCG, across matrices of micro-architectures and optimization levels (217 containers across 24 instance types and over 7500 runs). We provide to the community 30 applications to deploy in our automated setup and perform a scaling study from 4 to a maximum of 256 nodes for both CPU and GPU applications. Finally, we use our gained knowledge about performance to generate compatibility artifacts that are used by a newly developed Kubernetes controller to intelligently select instance type based on optimizing a figure of merit. Along with insights to scaling in this environment with a collection of applications and templates to work from, we provide an overall strategy for approaching HPC application deployment and image selection based on compatibility in cloud.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) is swiftly emerging as a core component in the transformation of global healthcare systems, with its effectiveness contingent upon the readiness of the workforce, especially future physicians. The incorporation of AI into medical education must uphold essential principles, including ethical considerations, the preservation of the physician-patient relationship, and the primacy of human judgment. Preparing medical students for this evolution equips them to effectively leverage emerging technologies in clinical practice. This policy brief aims to establish a framework for preparing medical students for the future of AI in healthcare, assisting policymakers in universities, governments, and health authorities in developing effective educational programs. It presents prompt engineering as an innovative skill for medical students, facilitating personalized AI interactions in clinical simulations and ethical decision-making, while addressing existing gaps in current curricula. Incorporating findings from a 2025 cross-sectional study involving 1,619 medical students, this brief indicates a moderate level of AI readiness (61.34/100), with cognition identified as the weakest domain. This underscores the necessity for targeted curricula to bridge gaps in AI knowledge and cultivate practical skills such as prompt engineering for clinical simulations.

<p>Glial Innexin2 expression plays a role in suppression of heat-induced seizures and maintaining sleep architecture in <i>Drosophila</i>. A North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (NS-PME) model shows a decreased level and altered expression pattern of glial Innexin2, along with heat-induced seizures and disturbed sleep architecture.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>North Sea Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (NS-PME) is a rare genetic disease that presents at an early age with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, and epilepsy. The disease is caused by a mutation in the Golgi SNAP receptor 2 gene (GOSR2). However, the consequences of this genetic defect at the cellular level are still unknown. Using a NS-PME <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model, it was previously found that knockdown of <i>membrin</i>, the fruit fly GOSR2 ortholog, in glial cells leads to progressive heat-induced seizure-like behavior in adult flies. Upon close inspection, we found NS-PME flies not only show progressive heat-induced seizures but also disrupted sleep architecture (higher number of shorter sleep bouts). Here we asked what glial cellular consequences could be underlying these phenotypes of <i>membrin</i> knockdown. First, we investigate whether these phenotypes are attributed to specific glial types; we found that these phenotypes were partly reproduced with specific knockdown of <i>membrin</i> in perineurial glia only. Next, we show that Innexin2, a gap junction protein specifically expressed in glia, is affected upon <i>membrin</i> knockdown, with an altered expression pattern and reduced protein levels. Finally, glial overexpression of Innexin2 in the background of glial <i>membrin</i> knockdown strongly ameliorates the heat-induced seizure phenotype, disrupted sleep architecture, as well as Innexin2 expression pattern, corroborating the importance of Innexin2 in maintaining neuronal homeostasis in NS-PME. These findings show that dysregulation of Innexin2 at least partially underlies the phenotypes of <i>membrin</i> knockdown in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and could suggest a similar role of Innexin2-like proteins in the human disease NS-PME.</p>

                Purpose The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate differences in pathological outcomes and safety between subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer management. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect for original articles published until February 2024 that compared tumour characteristics, biochemical markers, and adverse effects associated with these treatments. The risk of bias from each study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Risk of Bias-2 (ROB-2) tool. Results Eleven studies meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed. Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT effectively reduced tumour size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Subcapsular orchiectomy was linked to higher surgical complication rates. At the same time, due to its systemic pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacological ADT carries a greater risk of metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and insulin resistance. Conclusions Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT are viable options for prostate cancer treatment. However, their differing safety and pharmacological profiles highlight the need for personalised treatment strategies based on individual patient factors and preferences.

     alt="Ophthalmologic Findings in an Induced Model of Holoprosencephaly in Zebrafish"/>
<p>We used a zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) model to variably induce <i>bmp4</i> during embryonic development. We show ophthalmologic phenotypes of variable severity depending on the length and onset of <i>bmp4</i> inductions. We find phenotypes like ocular hypotelorism, synophthalmia, cyclopia, and anophthalmia, which are described to be part of the HPE spectrum.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most frequent developmental disorder of the forebrain. In this condition, the separation of the early precursor domains is hampered. A spectrum of clinical manifestations can be observed, for example, severe forms like alobar HPE and less severe forms like lobar HPE. Ophthalmologic findings that accompany HPE also occur as a spectrum that ranges from ocular hypotelorism and synophthalmia to cyclopia and anophthalmia. In this brief analysis, we made use of a recently established zebrafish model of HPE. This model is based on experimental BMP ligand induction that resulted in anophthalmia. We attenuated the induction protocol to investigate whether the ophthalmologic phenotype can also be attenuated. We found a spectrum of ocular phenotypes: ocular hypotelorism, cases of synophthalmia, and cyclopia.</p>

                Singh et al. show that TMZ treatment in glioblastoma induces ATR- and PNPT1-dependent degradation of miR-181d. Loss of miR-181d de-represses PNPT1, establishing a feedforward loop that amplifies TMZ-induced miR-181d degradation. This circuit enhances MGMT expression and cell-to-cell variability, highlighting a mechanism driving resistance to alkylating chemotherapy.

                Miller et al. use fMRI to demonstrate that human hippocampal CA2/3 subfield damage results in retrograde autobiographical amnesia and destabilized frontal autobiographical mnemonic representations. Mnemonic stability in the right inferior frontal gyrus predicts retrograde episodic memory performance.

                Only a small number of barrier-enhancing factors have been discovered to specifically increase barrier integrity, enhance vessel stability, and make vessels resistant to fluid leakage. Here, Fahey et al. present DEVDIL-36β as a cytokine promoter of vascular integrity in the CNS, with barrier-enhancing properties through upregulation of junctional components.

                Miao et al. demonstrate that KIF18A depletion causes synthetic defects with CENP-C hypomorphic mutant and KIF18A functions for chromosome congression in cooperation with CENP-E. CENP-E levels at kinetochores are reduced in KIF18A-knockdown-sensitive cancer cells, suggesting that CENP-E is a potential marker for vulnerability to KIF18A inactivation in cancer cells.

Here, the authors evaluate the contribution of the E3 ligases LUBAC and TRAF6 in controlling CBM activity, using Jurkat and primary human T cells. Unlike TRAF6, LUBAC is largely dispensable for activating NF-﻿κB, but it modifies BCL10 and regulates MALT1 protease activity by controlling substrate selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105466">Parallel HIV-1 fitness landscapes shape viral dynamics in humans and macaques that develop broadly neutralizing antibodies</a></h4>

              
                HIV-1 evolves within individual hosts to escape adaptive immune responses while maintaining its capacity for replication. Coevolution between HIV-1 and the immune system generates extraordinary viral genetic diversity. In some individuals, this process also results in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that can neutralize many viral variants, a key focus of HIV-1 vaccine design. However, a general understanding of the forces that shape virus-immune coevolution within and across hosts remains incomplete. Here, we performed a quantitative study of HIV-1 evolution in humans and rhesus macaques, including individuals who developed bnAbs. We observed strong selection early in infection for mutations affecting HIV-1 envelope glycosylation and escape from autologous strain-specific antibodies, followed by weaker selection for bnAb resistance. The inferred fitness effects of HIV-1 mutations in humans and macaques were remarkably similar. Moreover, we observed a striking pattern of rapid HIV-1 fitness gains that precedes the development of bnAbs. Our work highlights strong parallels between infection in rhesus macaques and humans, and it reveals a quantitative evolutionary signature of bnAb development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106305">A tissue boundary orchestrates the segregation of inner ear sensory organs</a></h4>

              
                The inner ear contains distinct sensory organs, produced sequentially by segregation from a large sensory-competent domain in the developing otic vesicle. To understand the mechanistic basis of this process, we investigated the changes in prosensory cell patterning, proliferation, and character during the segregation of some of the vestibular organs in the mouse and chicken otic vesicle. We discovered a specialised boundary domain, located at the interface of segregating organs. It is composed of prosensory cells that gradually enlarge, elongate, and are ultimately diverted from a prosensory fate. Strikingly, the boundary cells align their apical borders and constrict basally at the interface of cells expressing or not the Lmx1a transcription factor, an orthologue of <i>Drosophila</i> Apterous. The boundary domain is absent in <i>Lmx1a</i>-deficient mice, which exhibit defects in sensory organ segregation and is disrupted by the inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility. Altogether, our results suggest that actomyosin-dependent tissue boundaries ensure the proper separation of inner ear sensory organs and uncover striking homologies between this process and the compartmentalisation of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc by lineage-restricted boundaries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91431">Eye-specific differences in active zone addition during synaptic competition in the developing visual system</a></h4>

              
                Spatially clustered synaptic inputs enable local dendritic computations important for learning, memory, and sensory processing. In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild-type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these ‘multi-active-zone’ (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single-active-zone synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs but develop fewer synapses overall and show reduced synaptic clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal eye-specific differences in release site addition that correlate with axonal segregation outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement.

">Increased levels of HAPLN2, which anchors dense extracellular matrix, in the hippocampus of APOE4 targeted replacement mice</a></h4>

              
                Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2) / Brain link protein-1 (Bral1) is important for the binding of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) to hyaluronan and thus for the formation of specific types of brain extracellular matrix (ECM). It is also significantly increased with aging. Machine learning has also identified it as a brain-derived protein most predictive of Alzheimers disease (AD). HAPLN2 binds to CSPGs that may sequester aggregation-prone proteins and also restrict neuronal plasticity. Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) allele increases AD risk and thus in the present study we have examined hippocampal lysates from APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice using unbiased proteomics as well as Western blot and hippocampal immunostaining. Proteomics data show that HAPLN2 is among the most significantly upregulated proteins in APOE4 mice. Prior work suggests HAPLN2 is particularly important to the assembly of perinodal matrix. Herein we show that it also co-localizes with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) positive perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs represent a dense form of ECM that can increase GABAergic neurotransmission to alter overall excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal oscillations important to mood and memory. Proteomics also detected elevated levels of high temperature requirement peptidase-1 (HTRA1). HTRA1 accumulates in cerebral blood vessels harboring amyloid in APOE4 mice. Western blot studies of lysates from APOE4 mice also showed significantly reduced levels chondroitin-6 sulfated proteoglycans. This change makes PNNs more susceptible to proteolysis and less inhibitory. Immunostaining studies further showed that levels of the PNN component aggrecan were increased in the hippocampus of APOE4 animals. Overall these findings contribute to an emerging body of literature suggesting that brain extracellular matrix may be altered with aging and other risk factors for AD. Findings also suggest that future studies should assess peri-nodal structure and axonal conduction in the background of APOE4.

">Brain lipidomics identifies mitochondrial redox dysfunction and metabolic trade-offs associated with Parkinsons disease-like pathology induced by Nanoplastics exposure</a></h4>

              
                Growing nanoplastics exposure raises concern for neurotoxicity, particularly given recent evidence of plastic accumulation within human brain tissue- a highly lipid enriched organ, yet effects on brain lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we employed high-resolution untargeted lipidomics to map brain lipid perturbations in Drosophila melanogaster chronically exposed to environmentally relevant levels of polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs). Polystyrene NPs accumulated in fly brains and induced dose-dependent remodeling of mitochondrial membrane lipids, notably cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamines, accompanied by increased diacylglycerols/triacylglycerols and monounsaturated fatty acids and by lipid-droplet expansion. Guided by these lipidomic signatures, targeted biochemical assays demonstrated depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated mitochondrial reactive-oxygen species, inhibition of respiratory-chain complexes I and IV, and a shift in NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox couples toward a reduced state and increasing lipid peroxidation. This redox imbalance was accompanied by decreased tyrosine-hydroxylase expression, dopamine depletion, and impaired locomotor behavior, hallmarks of PD-like neurodegeneration. Dopaminergic neurochemistry was impaired (tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine decreased), with concomitant reduction of GABA, and locomotor and circadian deficits emerged. Remarkbly, co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation, normalized neutral lipid and MUFA accumulation, and rescued neurotransmitter levels and behavior. Stable-isotope tracing confirmed disrupted TCA cycle flux after NP exposure that was rescued by NAC. Collectively, these findings reveal lipidomic remodeling as a critical link between environmental nanoplastic exposure and PD-like pathology, highlighting mitochondrial redox lipid interactions as early determinants and support redox-directed interventions to mitigate risk.

">Impact of early locus coeruleus lesions in the TgF344 Alzheimer's disease rat model</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: In murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), lesioning the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system with DSP-4 exacerbates AD-like neuropathology and cognitive impairment. However, the impact of LC lesions during prodromal stages is poorly characterized. METHODS: TgF344-AD and wild-type rats received monthly injections of DSP-4 or saline from 1-5 months of age, a time point preceding forebrain plaque or tangle deposition in TgF344-AD rats, after which behavior and pathology were assessed. RESULTS: DSP-4 compromised LC cell bodies, fibers, and NE content. LC lesion and the AD transgene each affected several affective behaviors and/or cognition individually, but few interactions were found and DSP-4 failed to exacerbate behavioral phenotypes or neuropathology in TgF344-AD rats. DISCUSSION: Combined with previous literature, our data suggest that LC lesions exacerbate pre-existing AD-like pathology and behavioral impairments, rather than accelerate their onset. Further characterization of LC lesions in TgF344-AD rats at different ages is warranted.

">Predicting individual incubation of opioid craving by whole-brain functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                A high risk of relapse triggered by craving during abstinence remains a main challenge in opioid addiction treatment. Multiple brain regions have been implicated in opioid craving, but the brain-wide neural mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Using resting-state fMRI and connectome-based predictive modeling, we identified a whole-brain connectome that predicted the time-dependent increases (incubation) in oxycodone craving in individual rats after voluntary abstinence induced by exposure to an electric barrier. Incubation of oxycodone craving was operationally defined as the increase in non-reinforced lever pressing during relapse tests from early (day 1) to late (day 15) abstinence (incubation score). We found that changes in whole-brain functional connectivity during abstinence, but not during oxycodone self-administration, predicted the incubation score. Greater decreases in functional connectivity were associated with higher incubation scores. The predictive connectome involved complex interactions across multiple brain systems, including frontal-striatal, frontal-insula, insula-striatal, and hippocampal and sensorimotor circuits. To test causality of the predictive connectome, we examined the effect of pharmacological inactivation of dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which significantly decreased oxycodone seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence. DMS inactivation increased connectivity strength within the predictive connectome, supporting a causal role of this connectome in incubation of oxycodone craving. The predictive connectome did not predict food-reward seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence, indicating specificity to oxycodone craving. Our findings identify a brain-wide connectome marker that predicts individual differences in the incubation of opioid craving and provide potential targets for developing personalized interventions and monitoring therapeutic outcomes in opioid addiction treatment.

">Dissociable neural substrates of integration and segregation in exogenous attention</a></h4>

              
                The integration-segregation theory proposes that early facilitation and later inhibition (i.e., inhibition of return, IOR) in exogenous attention arise from the competition between cue-target event integration and segregation. Although widely supported behaviorally, the theory lacked direct neural evidence. Here, we used event-related fMRI with an optimized cue-target paradigm to test this account. Cued targets elicited stronger activation in the frontoparietal attention networks, including the bilateral frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), consistent with the notion of attentional demand of reactivating the cue-initiated representations for integration. In contrast, uncued targets engaged the medial temporal cortex, particularly the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG), reflecting the segregation processes associated with new object-file creation and novelty encoding. These dissociable activations provide the first direct neuroimaging evidence for the integration-segregation theory. Moreover, we observed neural interactions between IOR and cognitive conflict, suggesting a potential modulation of conflict processing by attentional orienting. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into exogenous attention by clarifying the neural underpinnings of integration and segregation and uncovering the interaction between spatial orienting and conflict processing.

">A human forebrain organoid model phenocopies dysregulated RNA and protein homeostasis in ALS/FTD-associated TDP-43 proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Background TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy is a central hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet current experimental models fail to reproduce the full pathological spectrum without external stress or TDP-43 overexpression. This study aims to establish a human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived system that spontaneously manifests TDP-43 pathology driven by an ALS-associated TDP-43 mutation. Methods We generated forebrain 3-D organoid cultures from iPSC carrying the TDP-43 K181E patient mutation. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to define transcriptional alterations across cell types, and enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) was applied to examine the global RNA binding and splicing defects in mutant organoids. We further used immunostaining, RT-PCR and biochemical assays to confirm TDP-43 proteinopathy and validate findings from the multi-omics analyses. Results The TDP-43 K181E organoids recapitulated key disease features, including cytoplasmic p-TDP-43 accumulation, RNA dysregulation, and cryptic exon inclusion. Single-cell analysis revealed a population of immature neurons with enhanced neuroinflammation and altered translation capacity. Comparative transcriptomics showed that the ALS mutation-induced transcriptional changes strongly overlap with those in ALS patient-derived brains. eCLIP analysis showed that mutant TDP-43 exhibited altered RNA-binding specificity, resulting in widespread RNA mis-splicing and cryptic exon inclusion. RT-PCR confirmed PRDM2, a gene regulating cell senescence, is mis-spliced in mutant cells. These defects collectively disrupt neuronal homeostasis and cell-cell communications. Conclusions Our iPSC-derived forebrain organoid model displays spontaneous TDP-43 proteinopathies and associated molecular dysfunctions without artificial manipulation. The model offers a robust platform for dissecting the mechanisms of TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration and advancing therapeutic discovery in ALS and FTD.

">Activation of IRF7/ISG15 axis in microglia inhibits NLRP3 Expression and Improves the Prognosis of Ischemia/Reperfusion in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality, with neuroinflammation playing a key role in post-stroke injury. The molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined. This study explored the functions of IRF7 and its downstream target ISG15 in stroke-associated neuroinflammation and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic datasets from microglia and ischemic brain tissues identified both molecules as hub genes. Their expression was validated in a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model and in microglial cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). The effects of these molecules were assessed using siRNA knockdown, conditioned media assays with SY5Y neuronal cells, in vivo overexpression of ISG15, histological and functional assessments. Both IRF7 and ISG15 were significantly upregulated after stroke. IRF7 knockdown reduced ISG15 expression, whereas ISG15 knockdown did not affect IRF7, suggesting a unidirectional regulatory relationship. Conditioned media from microglia treated with siIRF7 or siISG15 increased SY5Y cell mortality, with a stronger effect in the siISG15 group, highlighting neuroprotective role of ISG15. ISG15 knockdown also enhanced microglial migration. Conversely, microglial ISG15 overexpression in vivo promoted a shift toward reduced neuroinflammation, improved neuronal survival, and enhanced functional recovery. Mechanistically, ISG15 stabilized NLRP3 protein but more strongly decreased its mRNA stability through accelerated degradation. These findings demonstrate that the activation of IRF7/ISG15 axis in microglia inhibits NLRP3 Expression and improve the prognosis of ischemia/reperfusion in mice, with ISG15 exerting stronger neuroprotective effects. Targeting microglial ISG15 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

">QuNex Recipes: Executable, Human-Readable Workflows for Reproducible Neuroimaging Research</a></h4>

              
                Preprocessing and analysis of neuroimaging data are technically demanding, often requiring a combination of multiple software tools, modality-specific pipelines, and extensive parameter tuning to match dataset characteristics. These complexities make it difficult to document workflows in sufficient detail to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we introduce QuNex recipes, a framework for defining and executing complete neuroimaging workflows -- encompassing data onboarding, preprocessing, and analysis -- in a transparent, machine- and human-readable format. Recipes are implemented as an integrated feature of the Quantitative Neuroimaging Environment & Toolbox (QuNex), a containerized, open-source platform for end-to-end multimodal and multi-species neuroimaging processing. The recipes framework enables seamless integration of QuNex commands with custom scripts and external tools, capturing every processing step and parameter setting. A fully reproducible study can thus be shared and replicated by providing only (a) the QuNex version used, (b) the recipe file, and (c) the data. This approach standardizes workflow specification, enhances transparency, and enables one-command replication of complex neuroimaging analyses. By providing a standardized way to describe and share workflows, recipes facilitate open exchange of best practices and reproducible methods within the neuroimaging community.

">Astrocytic FABP5 drives non-cell-autonomous oligodendrocyte injury in multiple system atrophy by promoting TNF signaling and ferroptotic stress</a></h4>

              
                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal -synucleinopathy characterized by progressive parkinsonism, cerebellar and autonomic dysfunction. Currently, the mechanisms driving cerebellar white matter neuroinflammation and degeneration in MSA are poorly understood. Here, we identified fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) as a key factor regulating cerebellar inflammation in MSA pathogenesis in a detailed study of human, mouse and cultured astrocytes. Firstly, transcriptomic profiling of human MSA cerebellar white matter revealed activation of pro-inflammatory and ferroptotic pathways, with FABP5 identified as a key pathway component that is upregulated. We confirmed that FABP5 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes in the PLP--syn transgenic mouse model, also in LPS-treated primary astrocytes. Fabp5 silencing suppressed TNF signaling, mitigated ferroptosis, and restored mitochondrial function. These findings suggest astrocytic FABP5 as a central intracellular regulator linking glial inflammation, ferroptosis, and mitochondrial injury. Overall, this mechanism suggests that FABP5 drives pathology mediated by astrocytes oligodendroglia in MSA, therefore representing a novel and promising therapeutic target.

">The Earlier You Know, the Smoother You Act</a></h4>

              
                Intercepting a moving object with our hands requires that the moving object and the hand come into contact at some point along the object's trajectory. Hand movement must, therefore, be planned in advance so that the hand reaches a chosen spatial location along this trajectory at the correct moment in time. To enable such anticipatory behavior, the object's trajectory must be predicted based on sensory information collected before movement planning is concluded. Early completion of planning would allow for a smooth and economical movement; however, it also requires sufficiently accurate information about the object's movement to be available earlier. We investigate interception in the context of a complex, naturalistic motor task, toss juggling, to understand the extent to which proprioceptive and tactile information influence anticipatory movements of the catching hand. In our study, we compared solo juggling, where the efferent, tactile and proprioceptive information from the throwing hand is available during catch planning, with dyadic juggling, a functionally ''deafferented'' condition where no such information is available because the ball has been thrown by another person. Our results indicate that when internal and tactile information from the toss is absent, anticipatory behavior is greatly reduced. Experienced jugglers seem to rely more strongly on internal information than vision, allowing earlier planning and lower target uncertainty. In the dyadic condition, when internal information is absent, trajectory planning is delayed, leading to greater target uncertainty.

">Dissecting mammalian cortical circuit development at single-cell resolution using inducible barcoded rabies virus</a></h4>

              
                Highly organized circuits of connected neurons enable diverse brain functions. Improper development of these circuits is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and understanding how circuits are formed is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms of these diseases. We currently have an incomplete picture of how specific brain circuits develop and how they are affected in disease, because we lack methods to study them at scale and with single-cell resolution. Monosynaptic rabies tracing is the gold standard method to study circuit architecture. However, it suffers from cellular toxicity, low throughput, lack of control over the timing of labeling, and the inability to access the molecular profiles of individual neurons. To address these issues, we developed an inducible barcoded rabies virus (ibRV) to enable temporal-controlled labeling of synaptic circuits followed by high-throughput single-cell genomics readout. ibRV allows for dissecting neuronal circuit changes over time at single-cell and spatial resolution. We applied ibRV to study the development of specific mouse cortical circuits during late prenatal and postnatal life using single-cell genomics and unbiased spatial transcriptomics as readouts. We characterized and quantified developmental connectivity patterns and molecular cascades that underlie their formation. Additionally, we constructed functional in silico circuit models that enable interrogation of circuit function and dysfunction at specific developmental stages. Our study provides novel tools for circuit analysis and can provide new insights into the mechanisms of mammalian brain development.

                Investigating the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying food choices has the potential to advance our understanding of eating behaviour and inform health-targeted interventions and policy. Large, publicly available neural and behavioural datasets can enable new discoveries and targeted hypothesis tests, yet no such datasets are currently available. We present the FOODEEG dataset containing electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to a diverse array of food images, as well as behavioural measures of food cognition (food categorisation task, food go/no-go task, and food choice task responses), collected from 117 participants. We also provide normative ratings for the food image stimuli with respect to 22 food attributes, including nutritive, hedonic and taste properties, familiarity, and elicited emotions. Our dataset also includes questionnaire-based measures of participants' food motivations, dietary styles, and general motivational tendencies. In the validation analyses, we demonstrate that early food-evoked EEG responses in our dataset are consistent with observations in previous work. The FOODEEG dataset will be valuable for accelerating research into the neural substrates of visual food processing, dietary decisions, and individual differences.

">A Distinct Subpopulation of Extended Amygdala Neurons Drives Food Intake</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurons in the oval subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) integrate stress and reward signals to regulate motivated behaviors, including food consumption. However, the contribution of specific ovBNST neuronal subpopulations remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) expressing ovBNST neurons using chemogenetics, immunohistochemistry, and viral circuit mapping. Methods and Results: Using stimulatory hM3Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we found that chemogenetic activation of ovBNST Vipr2 neurons significantly increased food intake. We then quantified cFos activation in Vipr2-tdTomato reporter mice following several unique feeding-related manipulations, finding that food restriction (FR) robustly activated ovBNST Vipr2 neurons. Further analysis revealed decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) innervation of the ovBNST following FR, in which reduced VIP expression was significantly associated with greater ovBNST Vipr2 cFos activation. Given previous reports of reduced food intake following stimulation of ovBNST neurons expressing protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}), we used immunostaining to uncover that Vipr2 and PKC{delta} mark largely non-overlapping ovBNST neuronal subpopulations, aligning with their opposing effects on food intake. Finally, Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing revealed that ovBNST Vipr2 neurons project prominently to the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), two feeding-related regions. Conclusions: Together, these results identify ovBNST Vipr2 neurons as a functionally distinct BNST subpopulation that promotes feeding, is activated by food restriction, and links ovBNST neuropeptide signaling to hypothalamic feeding centers.

">Investigating the Role of Exosome-associated Human Endogenous Retroviruses as Biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease</a></h4>

              
                Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV K) reactivation is increasingly implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with ongoing clinical trials investigating antiretroviral therapies. However, there is a limited understanding of how HERV-K is trafficked in peripheral biofluids, and the role of exosomes, which are nano sized extracellular vesicles, in this process remains largely unexplored. Exosomes offer a stable and cell-specific cargo reservoir that may reflect central pathogenic processes and serve as a minimally invasive biomarker source. In this study, we isolated plasma-derived exosomes from ALS patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 16), and quantified exosomal HERV-K gag, env, and pol transcript levels using SYBR Green qPCR with RNase treatment and normalization to both traditional and exosome enriched reference genes. HERV K pol expression was significantly elevated in ALS, with fold-changes ranging from 1.59 to 1.85 (P = 0.037 to 0.051). env and gag also showed increased expression, though with greater variability. Normalization to the exosome-specific gene SOD2 provided the most consistent signal. A trend toward higher pol expression in bulbar-onset ALS was observed. These findings suggest that exosomal HERV-K transcripts, particularly pol, could serve as accessible biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment monitoring in HERV K targeted ALS trials. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for using exosomal cargo to track endogenous retroviral activity in neurodegeneration, supporting further investigation of liquid biopsy approaches in ALS precision medicine.

">Peripheral Nerve Transection Predominantly Drives Sympathetic Nerve Sprouting in Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglia</a></h4>

              
                Sympathetic sprouting in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) is a feature of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) following peripheral nerve injury, yet the factors determining its occurrence remain unclear. Here, we compare transection and crush injury models to determine if injury type or site influence sympathetic remodeling and pain. Using TH-IR immunostaining and Phox2b reporter mice to selectively label sympathetic fibers, we found that an L5 spinal nerve transection (SpNT) triggered robust sympathetic fiber sprouting and elevated norepinephrine (NE) levels in the DRG, correlating with a mechanical hypersensitivity reversed by chemical sympathectomy. In contrast, a partial sciatic nerve crush injury (PCI) produced long-lasting mechanical hypersensitivity without sympathetic sprouting or NE elevation and was unaffected by sympathectomy. Importantly, sympathetic sprouting was consistently more pronounced after transection injuries at both spinal and sciatic nerve sites, suggesting that injury type, rather than location, is a dominant factor shaping sympathetic remodeling. These findings establish nerve transection as a key driver of sympathetic sprouting and SMP, whereas crush-induced pain likely involves distinct non-sympathetic mechanisms. This distinction has important implications for pain subtype identification and treatment strategies.

">Short-term microglia depletion via CSF-1R inhibition promotes functional network reorganization and motor recovery after cortical ischemia</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Pharmacological options to promote long-term rehabilitation after stroke remain limited. Microglia play a complex role in post-stroke pathology, contributing both to repair and secondary injury. How short-term depletion during the subacute phase affects functional recovery remains unknown. METHODS: Wild-type mice were trained in a skilled reaching task and underwent permanent distal medial cerebral artery occlusion or sham intervention. Mice received either a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor or vehicle treatment between days 3 and 7 post-stroke to deplete microglia. Fine motor performance was assessed behaviorally while bilateral cortical activity was recorded longitudinally through epidural electrocorticography. RESULTS: Microglia depletion did not affect infarct size but resulted in near-complete restoration of fine motor function by day 7, coinciding with maximal microglial depletion. Recovery of fine motor function was accompanied by significant functional connectivity changes in bilateral sensorimotor networks, including increased beta-band connectivity in the ipsilesional motor cortex, which correlated with contralateral fine motor improvement. After microglial repopulation, cells showed altered morphology and gene expression profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Transient microglial modulation during the subacute phase after stroke promotes cortical network reorganization and motor recovery, highlighting a potential time window for future translational studies.

">The Cortical Temporal Axis: MEG-Based Cross-Frequency Gradients with Biological Anchors</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations have long been used to characterize the temporal dynamics of individual brain regions, yet a parsimonious, system level representation that integrates multi rhythmic activity has been lacking. Using source localized resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we computed regional power spectra and assessed spectral similarity, then applied diffusion map embedding to construct cross frequency neurophysiological gradients that place whole brain oscillations within a unified, low dimensional coordinate system. We found the first three gradients accounted for over 40% of the variance, remained stable across individuals, and aligned with established functional, structural, and geometric cortical axes. Computational modeling showed that these gradients reflect local excitation inhibition balance, while multimodal analyses revealed strong associations with neurotransmitter receptor distributions, cytoarchitecture, and cell type specific gene expression. Lifespan analyses further demonstrated systematic gradient reorganization, with distinct cognitive mappings onto functions such as language, memory, and multisensory integration. Clinically, Parkinson's disease patients displayed disrupted gradients, particularly in regions linked to language and social cognition. Finally, these gradient patterns exhibited high test retest reliability. These findings establish MEG derived neurophysiological gradients as robust, low dimensional representations of cortical organization, offering a biologically grounded framework for studying brain aging and disease.

">Inhibitory Motifs Quench Synchrony Induced by Excitatory Motifs in Biological Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                The connectivity in biological neuronal networks is known to deviate significantly from the random network (Erdos-Renyi) model. Specifically, di-synaptic motifs like reciprocal, convergent, divergent, and chain are found to be either over-represented or under-represented in certain brain regions. Over-representation of such motifs among excitatory neurons is known to induce synchrony. However, cortical activity is typically asynchronous. Thus, it remains unclear how synchrony induced by excitatory motifs may be reduced to physiological levels. To address this question, we systematically vary the prevalence of these four motifs in an Excitatory-Inhibitory (EI) network. We found that over-representation of chain and convergent motifs in the excitatory population led to increased firing rates and greater synchrony. However, this excess synchrony was quenched when we introduced the same type of motifs among inhibitory neurons. Because of the overabundance of motifs, some inhibitory neurons received fewer recurrent inhibitory inputs. Such weakly coupled neurons were primarily driven by uncorrelated external inputs, and therefore, these neurons exerted stronger inhibition on excitatory neurons and reduced both synchrony and firing rates. Thus, we also provide a new mechanism by which synchrony can be controlled in excitatory-inhibitory networks. We predict that the same kind of di-synaptic motifs should be present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

">Restoring signatures of consciousness by thalamic stimulation in a whole-brain model of an anesthetized nonhuman primate</a></h4>

              
                Treatment options for Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) are limited due to insufficient understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Two primary strategies for characterizing DoC and assessing treatment efficacy are in vivo experiments with animal models, and in silico computational models. We combined both approaches by creating a whole-brain model tailored to the experimental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a single anesthetized macaque. It was previously reported in an in vivo experiment that anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness was partially reversed by specific electrical stimulation of the thalamic central nuclei. The in silico model reproduced the brain dynamics underlying the restoration of consciousness, providing a potential explanation for the transition between these brain states as continuous trajectories unfolding in a low-dimensional space. Our results demonstrate that whole-brain computational models reproduce the spatiotemporal properties of fMRI recordings during loss of consciousness and during its recovery induced by electrical stimulation, enabling computational exploration of perturbation-based interventions to potentially personalize treatment and aid recovery of consciousness in DoC patients.

">Restraint Stress Prolongs Diestrus Phase of Mouse Estrous Cycle</a></h4>

              
                Globally, stress levels among women of reproductive age are rising, while fertility rates continue to decline. Despite this correlation, a causal link between stress and reduced fertility remains unclear. Experimental studies have shown that severe and chronic stress can disrupt reproductive function, but the effects of mild stress, more representative of the daily stress experienced by most women, are still poorly understood. This study aims to identify how mild stress affects the mouse estrous cycle. Nineteen mice were vaginally lavaged daily one week before stress, during 3-day stress, and one week after stress. The mild stress paradigm consisted of two hours of repeated restraint stress each day for three days. Restraint stress disrupted the estrous cycle causing a longer cycle length in stressed mice, characterized by an extended duration in the diestrus phase. These findings suggest that even moderate stress perturbs normal reproductive cycling, potentially contributing to reduced fertility. This work highlights the need to further explore how everyday stressors may subtly impair reproductive health.

">Distinct Effects of Aging and Klotho Deletion on the Choroid Plexus</a></h4>

              
                Klotho (Kl) is an anti-aging protein primarily produced in the kidney and the choroid plexus (CP, where it regulates cerebrospinal fluid composition and exerts neuroprotective effects. Here, we investigated the age-dependent consequences of a CP-specific Kl deletion on CP structure and function using mice lacking KL exclusively in CP epithelial cells (Kl{Delta}CP). In control mice, aging markedly disrupted CP architecture and cilia organization both in the lateral (LV-CP) and fourth ventricle (FV-CP). While CP-specific Kl deletion alone caused no major structural changes it induced region- and age-dependent calcification: FV-CP calcification increased in both aged and young Kl{Delta}CP mice, whereas LV-CP calcification emerged only in older Kl{Delta}CP mice. Proteomic analysis of the CP and hippocampus revealed mild molecular alterations, suggesting compensatory mechanisms that preserve structural and functional stability despite calcium dysregulation. Consistently, Kl{Delta}CP mice exhibited no significant behavioral or cognitive deficits. Overall, Kl deficiency sensitizes the CP to age-related calcification prior to overt structural decline, revealing a region-specific and functional link between Klotho, calcium imbalance, and brain aging.

">Electrophysiological profiling of exocytosis during early-stage development of the zebrafish lateral line</a></h4>

              
                Hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line have proven to be a good model for studying hair cell function in a system that is easily genetically manipulated, rapidly develops and is experimentally accessible. However, characterization of potential developmental changes, and possible differences along lateral line position are lacking. Here, we used in vivo patch clamp to investigate the electrophysiological and exocytic properties of neuromast hair cells over early development across body location. Long depolarizations led to steady increases in membrane capacitance, presumably due to exocytosis of vesicles localized to ribbon synapses. The magnitude and kinetics of capacitance changes did not vary significantly across the L1 to L6 position of neuromasts along lateral line, but the magnitudes were found to be significantly smaller in hair cells found in the tail region across all developmental time points. For each region, we found no significant changes in capacitance responses between 3 and 7 days after fertilization. Hair cell capacitance responses were greatly reduced in animals injected with CRISPR/Cas9 with gRNAs targeted to otoferlin b. These results confirm the essential role of otoferlin b in neuromast hair cell function, and they establish the fidelity of CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly mediate genetic removal of critical genes to study their impact on synaptic release.

                Generative AI can scaffold idea generation, but how it engages control, attention, and memory systems in the developing versus mature brain, and how this relates to creativity, remains unclear. We compared 6-7-year-old (N = 15) children and adults (N = 16) during a naturalistic 5-minute co-creative dialogue with ChatGPT using the same prompt, in-scanner conversation, undergoing functional MRI scanning and their dialogues were recorded. Functional connectivity (Fisher's z) was computed within and between seven large-scale networks: cingulo-opercular, default mode (DMN), memory retrieval, frontoparietal (FP), salience, ventral attention (VAN), and dorsal attention (DAN). Creativity scores, assessed outside of the scanner, did not differ between groups. Adults showed stronger within-network connectivity in control/attention systems, most robustly in FP, with additional effects in salience and DAN. Adults also exhibited greater cross-network integration, particularly FP-salience and FP-DAN couplings, alongside broader adult-greater effects among memory- and attention-related pairs. During a co-creative AI-assisted conversation, children exhibit a less coherent and integrated control-attention-memory architecture than adults. The combination of similar creativity scores with divergent neural profiles suggests that developmental differences in the implementation of creative cognition may be more pronounced than baseline capacity. Our findings highlight FP-centric pathways and their salience-gated interactions as candidate substrates by which creativity supports goal-directed co-creative dialogue with AI.

">Synergy mediates Long-Range Correlations in the Visual Cortex Near Criticality</a></h4>

              
                Long-range correlations are a key signature of systems operating near criticality, indicating spatially-extended interactions across large distances. These extended dependencies underlie other emergent properties of critical dynamics, such as high susceptibility and multi-scale coordination. In the brain, along with other signatures of criticality, long-range correlations have been observed across various spatial scales, suggesting that the brain may operate near a critical point to optimise information processing and adaptability. However, the mechanisms underlying these long-range correlations remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of synergistic interactions in mediating long-range correlations in the visual cortex of awake mice. We leverage recent advances in mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging to analyse the activity of thousands of neurons across a wide field of view, allowing us to confirm the presence of long-range correlations at the level of neuronal populations. By applying the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework, we decompose the correlations into synergistic and redundant information interactions. Our results reveal that the increase in long-range correlations during visual stimulation is accompanied by a significant increase in synergistic rather than redundant interactions among neurons. Furthermore, we analyse a combined network formed by the union of synergistic and redundant interaction networks, and find that both types of interactions complement each other to facilitate efficient information processing across long distances. This complementarity is further enhanced during the visual stimulation. These findings provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to long-range correlations in neural systems and highlight the importance of considering different types of information interactions in understanding correlations in the brain.

">Movement Effort does not alter the Planning Horizon of Sequential Reaching Movements</a></h4>

              
                Everyday tasks often involve multiple reaching movements in a sequence, where the choices made for one movement also affect the conditions for subsequent movements. Previous research indicates that humans are capable of planning ahead to optimize such sequences. Here, we ask whether increasing the resistance to movement prompts participants to plan even further ahead to reduce overall movement effort. Participants (n=28) were shown 14 targets that varied in size, value and location, and were instructed to accumulate as many points as possible. To collect each target, they reached while holding the handle of a robotic manipulandum that applied a resistive force. We analyzed their target choices using a planning model that takes into account the size, value and distance of several future targets. We expected that, as resistance -- and therefore the effort required to move between two targets -- increased, participants would plan further ahead to minimize total movement distance. Results show that participants typically planned 2-4 targets ahead. However, increasing resistance did not significantly affect the planning horizon. We conclude that movement effort is not a primary constraint on the planning horizon in sequential reaching movements.

">iPSC derived MSC secretome activates distinct neuroprotective pathways in a preclinical model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, which current therapies fail to address. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secretome holds promising therapeutic potential; however, the gold standard source - bone marrow (BM) - face scalability limitations. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived MSCs (iMSCs) are a rejuvenated and clinically attractive source, yet the effects of their secretome have not been studied in PD. Here, we directly compare the effects of BM-MSCs and iMSCs secretome in a 6-OHDA rat model. Despite few differences in secretome composition, both improved motor function and partially ameliorated anhedonia, but only iMSCs secretome significantly preserved dopaminergic neurons. Proteomic analysis revealed that BM-MSCs secretome activates antioxidant and proteostasis pathways, whereas iMSCs secretome activate broader pro-survival and regenerative pathways, including NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and mTOR. In addition, iMSC-secretome treatment modulated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, suggesting restoration of synaptic homeostasis beyond dopaminergic preservation. These findings demonstrate that iMSCs secretome exerts robust neuroprotective effects and shed light on the mechanisms underlying this scalable and clinically translatable therapy for PD.

">The Effect of Musical Groove on Sensorimotor Network Cortical Dynamics during Active Tapping and Passive Listening</a></h4>

              
                Musical groove, defined as the urge to move in response to rhythmic stimuli, drives spontaneous entrainment and engagement with music. Recent studies have investigated the activation of the sensorimotor network (SMN), focusing on the mu rhythm, an oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) ranges that reflects motor system engagement. While mu modulation differs between passive listening and active movement, it remains unclear whether these responses are shaped by the level of musical groove. Clarifying this relationship is crucial for understanding how neural oscillations transform rhythmic perception into embodied movement and how auditory and motor systems interact to generate the spontaneous urge to move. The present study investigates SMN dynamics by examining mu modulation across two factors: mode of engagement - active motor entrainment (finger tapping) versus passive listening, and groove level - low versus high. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were used to assess SMN activity, with a focus on mu rhythm modulation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Channel and cluster-based EEG analyses revealed stronger mu suppression during active tapping compared to passive listening, as well as an effect of musical groove. Self-reported groove ratings were not affected by the tapping task. Together, these findings highlight the modulation of the mu rhythm in the SMN, describing distinctive patterns of neural engagement during the experience of musical groove.

">Timing Is Everything: Temporal Dynamics of BOLD Responses to Naturalistic Features in Movie Watching</a></h4>

              
                Naturalistic stimuli, such as movies and narratives, are increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience to map cognitive and affective processes onto brain activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Features extracted from movies span multiple levels, from computational descriptions of visual and auditory input to physiological signals and subjective ratings. However, the temporal alignment between these features and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response can vary considerably, and the commonly used canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with temporal derivatives may not adequately capture these delays. In this study, we analyzed three movie-watching datasets and examined a range of features, including visual luminance and contrast, auditory pitch, a physiological measure of pupil size, and subjective ratings of theory of mind. We performed cross-correlation analyses between feature time series and fMRI responses across the whole brain. Our results show that the canonical HRF captures sensory features well but misaligns with slower signals such as pupil size and subjective ratings. Notably, raw pupil size and subjective ratings exhibited stronger correspondence with delayed hemodynamic responses. Lastly, we showed that video data can be used as continuous input to measure hemodynamic response functions across brain regions. These findings highlight the critical role of temporal alignment in mapping naturalistic features to brain activity. Accounting for feature-specific delays may improve the interpretability and accuracy of fMRI studies using complex, real-world stimuli.

">Pupil dilation indexes - but does not causally influence - conscious error detection: a double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of performance-monitoring using atomoxetine.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Conscious error detection is accompanied by error-related changes in phasic autonomic activity. This autonomic response is diminished in older age - accompanied by impairments in the conscious detection of action errors - i.e., increased "error blindness". Indeed, the degree to which the autonomic response to errors declines across the lifespan is correlated with the increase in error blindness. However, the direction of causality - whether changes in autonomic reactivity are a consequence or cause of increased error blindness - is still debated. In the present study, we experimentally modulated the phasic autonomic response to action errors in healthy older adults while measuring their conscious error detection. Methods: Across two sessions, thirty healthy older adults (60-80 years old) were given the sNRI atomoxetine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. In each session, they performed an anti-saccade task, which is commonly used to test conscious error detection. The autonomic response to errors was measured via changes in pupil dilation. A novelty-oddball task was also employed as a manipulation check. Results: Atomoxetine reduced phasic pupil dilation to both novel stimuli in the novelty-oddball task and to action errors in the anti-saccade task. However, despite this blunting of the phasic autonomic response to errors, there were no significant differences in conscious error awareness between atomoxetine and placebo. Primary task performance was also unaffected. Conclusions: Despite its effects on phasic autonomic activity after errors, atomoxetine had no effect on conscious error detection in healthy older adults. This suggests that phasic autonomic activity is a consequence, rather than a contributing factor, to conscious error awareness. It also suggests that changes to phasic autonomic activity is unlikely to explain increased error blindness in older age.

">Interval Timing Shows Selective Enhancement Under Psychosocial Stress: A Cortisol-Mediated Dissociation From Spatial Processing</a></h4>

              
                Acute stress affects cognitive processes, including our perception of time, yet few studies have examined how HPA axis activation specifically modulates time perception. This study provides the first systematic examination of how psychosocial stress influences temporal versus spatial reproduction using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), investigating underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Forty-four healthy adults (21 men; mean age 21.96 +/- 3.03) completed temporal and spatial reproduction tasks before and after TSST, with salivary cortisol sampling and DNA methylation analysis of four dopamine-related genes (COMT, DRD2, SLC6A3, TH). The TSST successfully elevated cortisol and state anxiety, confirming effective HPA axis activation. Critically, stress selectively reduced temporal underestimation. Despite their shared neurocognitive mechanisms, spatial processing remained unchanged. This demonstrates that HPA-mediated stress enhances interval timing. Men demonstrated greater stress-induced improvement in temporal accuracy than women, while neither sex showed significant spatial changes, independent of cortisol reactivity differences. The results are discussed in the context of dopaminergic models of temporal processing. Exploratory epigenetic analyses revealed a DRD2 methylation and cortisol response interaction for temporal tasks, with higher methylation associated with greater stress-induced improvement among high cortisol responders. However, sensitivity analysis indicated these interactions were driven by participants with extreme methylation values, limiting the generalizability of epigenetic results. These findings demonstrate that acute psychosocial stress selectively enhances temporal accuracy, potentially through cortisol-dopamine interactions in corticostriatal timing circuits. This work opens avenues for investigating stress-timing mechanisms and cortisol-dopamine interactions in timing circuits, and provides preliminary evidence for epigenetic moderation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The organization of the human cerebral cortex during fetal development is regulated by multiple processes, including neurogenesis and neuronal migration, which are essential for cortical expansion and folding patterns. According to the radial unit hypothesis, neurons originate in the germinal zone and migrate radially along the radial glial scaffolds to reach the cortical plate. However, the spatial distributions of these scaffolds and their roles in cortical folding remain unclear. Consequently, a computational model was developed to simulate virtual scaffolds extending from the cerebral ventricular surface to the white matter, incorporating region-specific neurogenic potential. The results demonstrate dense scaffold distribution in the perisylvian region, where complex cortical folding emerges, suggesting that differences in scaffold distribution contribute to region-specific cortical expansion. Notably, increased neuron influx along the scaffolds in the perisylvian region may contribute to early volumetric growth, potentially influencing Sylvian fissure formation. These findings align with previous reports that demonstrate distinct developmental patterns in this region. Being an accurate representation of radial migration pathways, this model provides a framework for integrating tangential migration of inhibitory neurons, refining scaffold distribution estimates, and quantifying early cortical development, offering insights into neurogenetic regional variations, scaffold architecture, and cortical folding in the human fetal brain.</span>

                <p>Exposure to early life stress (ELS) can exert long-lasting impacts on emotional regulation. The corticolimbic system including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in fear learning. Using the limited bedding paradigm (LB), we examined the functional consequences of ELS on excitatory and inhibitory tone in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC after fear conditioning in rats. In adults, LB exposure enhanced in vivo glutamate release in the PL mPFC during fear conditioning in male, but not female offspring. In contrast, the glutamate response to fear conditioning was diminished in LB-exposed pre-adolescent males, but not females. We investigated whether reduced glutamatergic inputs and/or elevated inhibitory tone might contribute to the diminished glutamate response in the mPFC following LB in pre-adolescent male rats. Indeed, we found that LB exposure specifically increased the activation of PV, but not SST interneurons in layer V, but not layer II/III of the PL mPFC in fear-exposed pre-adolescent males. Presynaptic glutamate release probability was reduced by LB exposure in layer V, but increased in layer II/III of the PL mPFC. These functional changes might be related to the LB-induced alterations in the bilaminar distribution of BLA and vHIP projections to the PL mPFC we observed in pre-adolescent males. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS modifies glutamate release and PL mPFC function during fear conditioning in a sex- and age-dependent fashion, likely through layer-specific shifts in excitation/inhibition balance.</p>

                <p>Higher education (HE) is undergoing rapid transformation, shaped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the expansion of digital learning, and the increasing presence of artificial intelligence (AI). For educators, these shifts raise important questions about their evolving purpose and responsibilities. In this commentary, we reflect on the role of bioscience educators in the United Kingdom, highlighting the enduring need for human connection, empathy, and belonging in teaching, alongside the integration of digital tools. We discuss changing student motivations, the necessity of flexible and inclusive learning environments, and the balance between traditional practices and innovative pedagogies. Practical training, active learning, and responsible engagement with emerging technologies remain central to equipping students with transferable skills such as adaptability, critical thinking, and resilience. We argue that while digital innovations can enhance accessibility and engagement, they cannot replace the uniquely human dimensions of teaching. Ultimately, bioscience educators must embrace their dual role as facilitators and lifelong learners, modeling curiosity, vulnerability, and inclusivity to empower students to thrive in an increasingly complex world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v2?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Whether income inequality erodes citizens’ (VA) depends on institutional context. We examine how integrity—proxied by Control of Corruption (CC)—conditions the inequality–voice link across developed and developing democracies. Methods We assemble a harmonised, unbalanced 10-country panel (2003–2022) with VA as outcome and a parsimonious set of regressors: lagged Gini, lagged poverty, lagged GDP-per-capita growth, CC, Political Stability, and Gini×CC. We test cross-sectional dependence, serial correlation, and stationarity (IPS/CADF). Given mixed orders of integration and no panel cointegration in Westerlund tests with bootstrap p-values, our main specification is first-difference two-way fixed effects with country-clustered inference. A dynamic Augmented Anderson–Hsiao (AAH) estimator provides robustness. Multicollinearity among governance pillars is addressed via diagnostics (VIF) and a parsimonious design. Heterogeneity is assessed via separate models for developed and developing groups. Results Diagnostics indicate cross-sectional and AR(1) dependence; VA, Gini, poverty, and CC behave as I(1), while growth and stability are I(0); Westerlund fails to reject no cointegration (bootstrap p≈0.51 across Gt/Ga/Pt/Pa). In Δ two-way FE, CC is a robust positive correlate of VA, whereas the main Gini effect is small/unstable; the Gini×CC term shows that integrity conditions the inequality–voice link. In developed countries, higher integrity attenuates the (marginally) negative association of inequality with VA (interaction >0). In developing countries, integrity amplifies a negative inequality–VA association as CC improves (interaction <0). The AAH model confirms high persistence in VA (lag ≈0.70, p<0.001), a positive CC effect (≈0.33, p≈0.02), and a borderline negative Gini×CC interaction (p≈0.08). Conclusions The political impact of inequality is context-dependent and integrity-mediated. Control of Corruption consistently emerges as the institutional dimension most tightly linked to citizens’ voice, while inequality’s association with VA hinges on governance quality and differs by development group. Absent cointegration, findings are interpreted as short-run within-country associations. Policy should pair inequality-reducing reforms with integrity-building measures to safeguard VA.

                Background Structural variants (SVs) and metagenomics remain challenging areas in genomics, requiring new tools and collaborative solutions. Hackathons provide a rapid, team-based approach to prototyping and innovation. Methods In August 2024, 48 scientists from six continents convened at Baylor College of Medicine for the Sixth Structural Variant Codeathon. Participants worked in interdisciplinary teams over three days, using public datasets and cloud-based infrastructure to design and implement computational tools. Results Eight projects were developed, addressing topics such as tandem repeat annotation, structural variant discovery, benchmarking, pangenome visualization, and machine learning applications. Each project produced open-source software, with repositories openly available on GitHub and archived on Zenodo. Conclusions The hackathon fostered global collaboration and generated reproducible, community-driven tools. These outputs provide new resources for structural variation and metagenomics research and demonstrate the effectiveness of hackathons in advancing genomic science.

                <p>by Yue Huang, Tianqi Tang, Xiaowu Dai, Fengzhu Sun</p>

Understanding microbial interactions is fundamental for exploring population dynamics, particularly in microbial communities where interactions affect stability and host health. Generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) models have been widely used to investigate system dynamics but depend on absolute abundance data, which are often unavailable in microbiome studies. To address this limitation, we introduce an iterative Lotka-Volterra (iLV) model, a novel framework tailored for compositional data that leverages relative abundances and iterative refinements for parameter estimation. The iLV model features two key innovations: an adaptation of the gLV framework to compositional constraints and an iterative optimization strategy combining linear approximations with nonlinear refinements to enhance parameter estimation accuracy. Using simulations and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that iLV surpasses existing methodologies, such as the compositional LV (cLV) and the generalized LV (gLV) model, in recovering interaction coefficients and predicting species trajectories under varying noise levels and temporal resolutions. Applications to the lynx-hare predator-prey, <i>Stylonychia pustula</i>-<i>P. caudatum</i> mixed culture, and cheese microbial systems revealed consistency between predicted and observed relative abundances showcasing its accuracy and robustness. In summary, the iLV model bridges theoretical gLV models and practical compositional data analysis, offering a robust framework to infer microbial interactions and predict community dynamics using relative abundance data, with significant potential for advancing microbial research.

Deep metabarcoding offers an efficient and reproducible approach to biodiversity monitoring, but noisy data and incomplete reference databases challenge accurate diversity estimation and taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, NEEAT, for removing spurious operational taxonomic units (OTUs) originating from nuclear-embedded mitochondrial DNA sequences (NUMTs) or sequencing errors. It integrates ‘echo’ signals across samples with the identification of unusual evolutionary patterns among similar DNA sequences. We also extensively benchmark current tools for chimera removal, taxonomic annotation and OTU clustering of deep metabarcoding data. The best performing tools/parameter settings are integrated into HAPP, a high-accuracy pipeline for processing deep metabarcoding data. Tests using CO1 data from BOLD and large-scale metabarcoding data on insects demonstrate that HAPP significantly outperforms existing methods, while enabling efficient analysis of extensive datasets by parallelizing computations across taxonomic groups.

     alt="Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibition Confers Neuroprotection via PPAR-α Activation During Intracerebral Hemorrhage"/>
<p>Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) exerts a neuroprotective effect in a collagenase-induced hemorrhagic stroke model, likely by increasing EETs. This neuroprotection appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of antioxidant balance. Notably, all the beneficial effects conferred by sEH inhibition were abolished by selective PPAR-α inhibition, indicating that EETs exert their neuroprotective actions through PPAR-α activation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), are known to possess potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant neuroprotective properties. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are not well understood. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective role of EETs in a hemorrhagic stroke model and the possible involvement of PPAR-α activation in this neuroprotection. Hemorrhagic damage was induced in mice through the intracerebral administration of collagenase VII in the striatum. The neuroprotective effect of EETs was tested in mice by pre-treatments of 2 h with TPPU, an inhibitor of the EETs metabolism. TPPU was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2 mg/kg. Brain damage was evaluated based on measurements of motor activity, hematoma volume, brain water content, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Additionally, the levels of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress balance, such as NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX-2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were determined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed that EETs exert neuroprotective effects by significantly decreasing all parameters related to brain damage, improving motor function and promoting an antioxidant state, as evidenced by increased levels of SOD and reduced levels of NOX enzymes. Subsequently, PPAR-α involvement was evaluated through the administration of GW6471, a PPAR-α antagonist. Pre-treating mice with GW6471 for 30 min, reverted all neuroprotective effects, including the observed changes in SOD and NOX levels. Our results demonstrate that EETs confer neuroprotection in hemorrhagic brain injury, and this effect is dependent on PPAR-α activation.</p>

                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 312 undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-853/v2?src=rss">Innovations in Inventory Management to Improve the Profitability of Local SMEs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Efficient inventory management is a critical internal capability for ensuring the financial sustainability of micro and small enterprises, especially in emerging economies affected by post-pandemic disruptions. In Bagua, Peru, MSMEs often lack digitised control systems, leading to frequent stock imbalances, rushed purchases at high prices, and lower profitability; a deeper understanding of inventory practices that drive financial performance can contribute to more informed and strategic decision-making. Method This quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory study examined the effects of four components of inventory management—control, valuation methods, control records, and measurement—on profitability; a convenience sample of 83 MSMEs yielded 200 valid responses from key personnel involved in inventory decisions; A 21-item Likert scale validated by experts was applied, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression in SPSS v27. Profitability indicators included return on assets (ROA), gross margin (GM), and return on equity (ROE). Results All dimensions of the inventory showed moderate levels of implementation (means: 2.37–2.62 on a five-point scale). The regression model demonstrated satisfactory predictive power (R2 = 0.402; F = 32.81; p < 0.001). Inventory measurement was the strongest and only highly significant predictor of profitability (β = 0.383; p < 0.001), followed by inventory control, with a smaller but significant contribution (β = 0.257; p = 0.013). Inventory valuation methods and control records did not show statistically significant direct effects (p > 0.40). Conclusion The findings highlight that decision-oriented measurement practices, supported by systematic control, are essential factors for the financial performance of micro and small enterprises; investment in digital monitoring tools, replenishment based on key performance indicators, and staff training could improve operational and financial efficiency; due to its cross-sectional design and localised context, future studies should incorporate longitudinal data and broader geographical comparisons to strengthen generalisation and explore possible mediation pathways between accounting-oriented practices and profitability.

                Background Although preventable and treatable, oral diseases affect nearly half of the world’s population, driven by limited accessibility and equity in oral healthcare services, and lack of integration of oral health into noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and universal health coverage (UHC) agendas. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy and Action Plan on Oral Health 2023–2030 (WHOOH) emphasizes the importance of embedding oral health in national health systems and policies. Evidence-informed oral health policies (OHPs) can help reduce disease burden, improve access, and address inequalities. However, in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO EMR) (hereafter, EMR), current policies have not achieved meaningful impact, constrained by barriers that require comprehensive analysis and systematic evaluation. This review aims to systematically identify and assess OHPs and barriers and facilitators influencing their creation, dissemination, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation (CDIM&E). Methods A systematic search was developed for Ovid MEDLINE, and also used to search Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos. It will also be applied to global and regional databases, covering January 2014 to December 2024 without language restrictions. Additional searches will be conducted on government websites (e.g., ministries of health) to capture OHPs. Eligible documents will include official and up-to-date national OHPs, and research or policy-related documents reporting barriers to and facilitators for the CDIM&E of OHPs. Independent reviewers will perform screening and data extraction using DistillerSR. Quantitative data will be analyzed in R Studio using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis in NVivo. Discussion Advancing evidence-informed OHPs in the EMR requires mapping existing national policies, evaluating their alignment with WHOOH targets, and understanding the barriers and facilitators for their CDIM&E. This review’s findings may help and support ministries of health, chief dental officers, academic institutions, and regional interest-holders to inform policy dialogue and support collective efforts to achieve the WHOOH targets. Registration The protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DQ6E4.

                Backgrounds Alopecia in captive non-human primates (NHPs) is a major animal welfare concern in many primate facilities. Some studies suggested that the mycobiome, considered fungal communities in specific areas, could influence the pathogenesis of alopecia. However, the pathogenesis mechanism of alopecia in cynomolgus macaques is poorly known. Objectives This study aims to investigate the association between alopecia and skin mycobiota in cynomolgus macaques. Methods Skin swab samples were collected from five areas where alopecia is common (arm, dorsal, head, leg, and ventral areas) of 47 healthy and 50 alopecic macaques. The samples were extracted for DNA. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) was applied to explore the skin mycobiota based on full-length Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. Results Our findings showed that alpha and beta diversities significantly differed between alopecic and healthy macaques among the five areas. Wallemia sebi was associated with alopecia in the arm. Furthermore, Candida albicans, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Exophiala dermatitidis, and Candida parapsilosis were prevalent in the dorsal and head areas. Moreover, Aspergillus penicillioides was dominant in the dorsal and ventral areas. Pseudozyma sp., Moesziomyces antarcticus, and Cladosporium dominicanum were uniquely found in the head area. Apiotrichum domesticum was highly observed in the leg and ventral areas. Lastly, Cladosporium halotolerans was uniquely detected in the ventral area. Conclusion These microorganisms may be associated with the development of alopecia in cynomolgus macaques. These findings might be useful for biomedical research and therapeutic management strategies of animal health in primate facilities in the future.

                This work presents a Marxist and activity-theoretical framework for understanding needs and wants as relational dynamics rather than fixed hierarchies. Drawing on the works of Marx, Engels, Gramsci, Mao Zedong, and Silvia Federici, alongside cultural-historical activity theory from Vygotsky, Leontyev, Rubinstein, Engeström, and Bedny, it conceptualizes needs as historically and socially produced relations between living beings and their modes of life. Integrating perspectives on emotion (Holodynski, Ratner, Roth, Burkitt) and biological agency (Michael Levin, Richard Lewontin), it examines how needs emerge ontogenetically, phylogenetically, and collectively, mediated by objects, tools, and cultural practices. The chapter emphasizes the material, symbolic, and pragmatic dimensions of mediation, showing how needs evolve through co-production of organisms and environments. Latin American veterinary and public health case studies illustrate the interplay of human, animal, and ecological needs in contexts such as companion animal care, livestock production, pest control, and wildlife conservation. By synthesizing socio-historical, psychological, emotional, biological, and ecological dimensions, the framework provides a holistic basis for analyzing and transforming how needs and wants are defined, aligned, and fulfilled in practice.

                Background Continuous exposure to sunlight and pollution without adequate protection can damage skin, making it prone to premature aging. One of the natural ingredients for anti-aging is antioxidant. Malang green apple (Malus sylvestris Mill) contains bioactive compounds that can act as antioxidants, but its use is still limited to only as food ingredient. Furthermore, some studies show the potency of fruit fermentation to increase these bioactive compounds. Thus, this study is a preliminary study to examine the anti-aging potency of fermented Malang green apples. Methods Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with fermented Malang green apple juice extract (FAJ) by Lactobacillus plantarum DAD-13 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermipan and its unfermented (AJ) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay and collagen deposition was measured using the Sirius red staining method. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) was measured in fibroblasts after treatment with extracts. Results Cell viability and collagen deposition of fibroblasts tended to be higher after 48 h of extract exposure. Fibroblasts that received FAJ 62.5 μg/mL showed higher cell viability than negative control (p <0.05) and FAJ 31.25 μg/mL showed higher collagen deposition than negative control (p <0.05) at 48 hours of extract exposure. AJ and FAJ also decreased MMP-1 gene expression. They showed a significant decrease in MMP-1 levels (p <0.01) compared to the untreated group, whereas they showed increased expression of COL1A1 at low concentrations. There was no significant difference in the gene expression between FAJ and AJ. Conclusions Our results indicated that Malang green apple juice extract affected fibroblast cell viability, collagen deposition, MMP-1, and COL1A1 gene expression. Better results were obtained at lower concentrations. Exposure of lower concentrations of FAJ to skin fibroblasts for 48 h resulted in better results.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Lewy body disease (LBD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in the brain. Neuroinflammation has long been implicated in LBD pathogenesis, and recent genetic studies in Parkinson's disease (a clinical manifestation of LBD) have shown consistent association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex. Here, we assessed whether variation in HLA alleles influences neuropathological burden in a neuropathologically-defined series of LBD cases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HLA allelic variants in a cohort of 539 LBD cases of European descent from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. High-resolution whole-genome sequencing was used, and the HLA alleles of each sample were called using the HLA*LA tool and assessed for association with neuropathological outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis identified 1 significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 3.43 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) and 4 suggestive (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) associations between certain HLA alleles and specific neuropathological outcomes in LBD, suggesting a potential role for HLA-mediated immune mechanisms in disease progression and subtype differentiation. Specifically, <i>HLA-DPB1*06:01</i> was significantly associated with lower Lewy body counts in the parahippocampal gyrus (<i>P</i> = 3.30 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), with weaker and suggestive associations observed in the middle frontal (<i>P</i> = 1.80 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) and inferior parietal gyrus (<i>P</i> = 6.33 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Additionally, although only suggestive, <i>HLA-DRB1*11:01</i> correlated with a lower Thal amyloid phase (<i>P</i> = 1.56 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), and <i>HLA-B*15:01</i> correlated with an increased risk of diffuse LBD (<i>P</i> = 7.58 x 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides a detailed evaluation of the relationship between HLA alleles and LBD pathology, highlighting the importance of immune-related genetic factors in the etiology of LBD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Does neural variability reflect random noise or a feature that benefits adaptive behavior? Using intracranial recordings in humans, Terlau et al. demonstrate that neural variability results from the recurrent connectivity structure along the cortical hierarchy, which supports the spatiotemporal unfolding from perceptual to cognitive processing.

                Zhang, Leonard, et al. use high-density direct human brain recordings to reveal how the superior temporal gyrus (STG) detects word boundaries in natural speech and encodes whole auditory word forms. Neural populations dynamically reflect properties of the whole-word units listeners perceive in continuous, connected speech.

                Robinson et al. found that the reactivation of experience-related neural ensemble patterns in hippocampus and cortex during sleep is specifically associated with a subset of large SWRs. Closed-loop optogenetic boosting of SWRs during post-task sleep enhanced ensemble reactivation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and improved memory performance in mice.

                The prevalence of obesity has led to significant interest in identifying the molecular mediators of adipose tissue expansion. In a recent issue of Cell Reports, Renzi and colleagues reveal a new mechanism by which creatine kinase B (CKB) regulates de novo lipogenesis in white adipocytes.

                MLL3 is frequently mutated across cancers. Liu et al. reveal that these mutations are associated with enhanced immune infiltration, predicting improved survival and immunochemotherapy response in endometrial and colon cancers, while Mll3 ablation in mouse models confirms its role in promoting anti-tumor immunity.

                Synthetic lethal paralogs have long been known, yet most paralog interactions are untested. Flister et al. report a screen of 36,648 known human paralog pairs. These data combined with a meta-analysis of 462 pairs across 49 cell models revealed insights into the molecular underpinnings of context-dependent synthetic lethality.

                Mori and colleagues show that the integrated stress response (ISR) cascade triggered in the postsynaptic muscle of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by acute amino acid restriction maintains baseline presynaptic release. This ATF4-independent, non-canonical ISR cascade enhances translation of Still life (Sif) and promotes neurotransmitter output at the NMJ.

                How traumatic brain injury (TBI) mechanistically contributes to neurodegenerative disease remains poorly understood. Marco et al. find that therapeutic viral vector-based delivery of VEGFC recuperates meningeal lymphatic drainage deficits post-TBI and protects against severe development of tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy.
