	<p>Background: In Down syndrome (DS), adaptive behaviour often shows a “surplus effect” (i.e., higher adaptive abilities than expected from cognitive skills). As inclusive schooling has become mandatory in Italy, we studied the impact of school inclusion on the surplus effect of adaptive behaviour in adult DS, considering potential confounding factors such as parental education. Methods: All consecutive DS individuals from three different sites were queried prospectively regarding type of schooling (inclusive and non-inclusive). Demographic data were documented; cognitive abilities and adaptive behaviour were assessed (Coloured Progressive Matrices and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales). The aim was to establish the presence of a surplus effect in adaptive behaviour, primarily in the overall level and secondarily in the main domains and subdomains. A multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model was used for the association of schooling, and parental education. Results: The majority (65%) showed a surplus effect in adaptive behaviour and had attended inclusive schools (85%). Higher adaptive skills as well as early and longer functional treatment programmes were more readily available for younger individuals. In the group of inclusive schooling, the surplus effect on overall adaptive behaviour was present in 70% as opposed to 38% in the group without inclusive schooling, significant when adjusted for gender and maternal education. This was also observed in socialisation, written, and community, and after adjustment in playing and leisure time. Conclusions: Adaptive behaviour showed a surplus effect in the majority of DS adults, even more so after inclusive schooling. Younger adults showed higher adaptive skills. Moreover, female gender and higher maternal educational level significantly enhanced this surplus effect.</p>

                <p>Biological neural networks operate at several levels of granularity, from the individual neuron to local neural circuits to networks of thousands of cells. The daily oscillation of the brain&rsquo;s master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) rests on a yet to be identified network of connectivity among its ~20,000 neurons. The SCN provides an accessible model to explore neural organization at several levels of organization. To relate cellular to local and global network behaviors, we explore network topology by examining SCN slices in three orientations using immunochemistry, light and confocal microscopy, real-time imaging, and mathematical modeling. Importantly, the results reveal small local groupings of neurons that form intermediate structures, here termed "phaseoids," which can be identified through stable local phase differences of varying magnitude among neighboring cells. These local differences in phase are distinct from the global phase relationship, namely that between individual cells and the mean oscillation of the overall SCN. The magnitude of the phaseoids&rsquo; local phase differences is associated with a global phase gradient observed in the SCN&rsquo;s rostral-caudal extent. Modeling results show that a gradient in connectivity strength can explain the observed gradient of phaseoid strength, an extremely parsimonious explanation for the heterogeneous oscillatory structure of the SCN.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Prenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) can result in microencephaly and congenital Zika syndrome, although some brain cells and structures are spared by the virus for unknown reasons. Here, a novel murine model of fetal ZIKV infection incorporating intraventricular infection and cell type-specific <I>in utero</I> electroporation (IUE) was used to identify the time course of ZIKV infection and to determine the identity of cells that are initially infected or spared during neocortical neurogenesis. <I>In vivo</I> time course studies revealed the presence of ZIKV in apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) at early time points following virus exposure, while basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) became maximally (ZIKV<sup>+</sup>) after 3 d of virus exposure. ZIKV-infected fetal brains exhibited microencephaly as early as 1 d following infection, regardless of developmental age. This change in brain size was caused in part by apoptosis and reduced proliferation that persisted until birth. While 60% of aRGC basal fibers were perturbed during infection, 40% retained normal morphology, indicating that aRGCs are not uniformly vulnerable to ZIKV infection. To investigate this heterogeneous vulnerability, we performed genetic fate mapping using cell type-specific probes derived from a mouse embryonic day (E)15.5 neocortical wall single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset. The results indicate that one class of aRGCs preferentially express the putative ZIKV entry receptor <I>AXL</I> and that these cells are more vulnerable to ZIKV infection than other aRGC subtypes with low <I>AXL</I> expression. Together, these data uncover crucial temporal and cellular details of ZIKV fetal brain infection for prevention strategies and for management of congenital Zika syndrome.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Behavioral flexibility enables the ability to adaptively respond to changes in contingency requirements to maintain access to desired outcomes, and deficits in behavioral flexibility have been documented in many psychiatric disorders. Previous research has shown a correlation between behavioral flexibility measured in a reversal learning test and <I>Syn3</I>, the gene encoding synapsin III, which negatively regulates phasic dopamine release. <I>Syn3</I> expression in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex is reported to be negatively correlated with reversal learning performance, so here, we used a global knock-out line to investigate reversal learning in mice homozygous wild type, heterozygous null, and homozygous null for the <I>Syn3</I> gene. Compared with wild-type animals, we found a reversal-specific effect of genetic <I>Syn3</I> deficiency that resulted in a greater proportional increase in trials required to reach a preset performance criterion during contingency reversal, despite no observed genotype effects on the ability to acquire the initial discrimination. Behavioral flexibility scores, which quantified the likelihood of switching subsequent choice behavior following positive or negative feedback, became significantly more negative in reversal only for <I>Syn3</I> homozygous-null mice, suggesting a substantial increase in perseverative behavior in the reversal phase. <I>Syn3</I> ablation reduced the number of anticipatory responses made per trial, often interpreted as a measure of waiting impulsivity. Overall, <I>Syn3</I> expression negatively affected behavioral flexibility in a reversal-specific manner but may have reduced waiting impulsivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Consistency of Prior Movements Shapes Locomotor Use-Dependent Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Repetition is an indispensable component of motor skill acquisition. However, it is unknown how consistent repeated movement patterns must be to engage an implicit "use-dependent" learning mechanism. In this Registered Report, we tackled this question through a combination of computational modeling, simulations, and behavioral experiments involving visually-guided treadmill walking. Our hypotheses were formalized by two distinct computational models: in the two-process Strategy plus Use-Dependent model, use-dependent learning is viewed as a slowly updating and slowly decaying bias in the direction of repeated movements. The Adaptive Bayesian model frames use-dependent learning as an emergent property of quickly adapting prior probabilities of target step lengths. Critically, the Adaptive Bayesian model is much more sensitive to variable practice than the Strategy plus Use-Dependent model. To test these hypotheses, human participants (<I>N</I> = 18, 10 females) learned a novel asymmetric stepping pattern under three conditions with differing amounts of practice consistency during a learning block. We probed use-dependent movement biases immediately postlearning by asking participants to "walk normally" during a washout block with no visual feedback (VF). We found that the total magnitude of use-dependent learning depended on practice consistency during learning, consistent with the Adaptive Bayesian model. However, this dependence faded quickly as biases became similar in magnitude over subsequent strides across all conditions, an observation more consistent with the Strategy plus Use-Dependent model. Simple <I>post hoc</I> adjustments to the Strategy plus Use-Dependent model made clear that these seemingly opposing effects of practice consistency can result from a unitary use-dependent learning process shaped by recent movement history.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Language Tasks and the Network Control Role of the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent work has combined cognitive neuroscience and control theory to make predictions about cognitive control functions. Here, we test a link between whole-brain theories of semantics and the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in controlled language performance using network control theory (NCT), a branch of systems engineering. Specifically, we examined whether two properties of node controllability, boundary and modal controllability, were linked to semantic selection and retrieval on sentence completion and verb generation tasks. We tested whether the controllability of the left IFG moderated language selection and retrieval costs and the effects of continuous  burst stimulation (cTBS), an inhibitory form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on behavior in 41 human subjects (25 active, 16 sham). We predicted that boundary controllability, a measure of the theoretical ability of a node to integrate and segregate brain networks, would be linked to word selection in the contextually-rich sentence completion task. In contrast, we expected that modal controllability, a measure of the theoretical ability of a node to drive the brain into specifically hard-to-reach states, would be linked to retrieval on the low-context verb generation task. Boundary controllability was linked to selection and to the ability of TMS to reduce response latencies on the sentence completion task. In contrast, modal controllability was not linked to performance on the tasks or TMS effects. Overall, our results suggest a link between the network integrating role of the LIFG and selection and the overall semantic demands of sentence completion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">IgM Immunoglobulin Influences Recovery after Cervical Spinal Cord Injury by Modulating the IgG Autoantibody Response</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in the development of detrimental autoantibodies against the lesioned spinal cord. IgM immunoglobulin maintains homeostasis against IgG-autoantibody responses, but its effect on SCI recovery remains unknown. In the present study we investigated the role of IgM immunoglobulin in influencing recovery after SCI. To this end, we induced cervical SCI at the C6/C7 level in mice that lacked secreted IgM immunoglobulin [IgM-knock-out (KO)] and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls. Overall, the absence of secretory IgM resulted in worse outcomes as compared with WT mice with SCI. At two weeks after injury, IgM-KO mice had significantly more IgG antibodies, which fixed the complement system, in the injured spinal cord parenchyma. In addition to these findings, IgM-KO mice had more parenchymal T-lymphocytes as well as CD11b+ microglia/macrophages, which co-localized with myelin. At 10 weeks after injury, IgM-KO mice showed significant impairment in neurobehavioral recovery, such as deteriorated coordination, reduced hindlimb swing speed and print area. These neurobehavioral detriments were coupled with increased lesional tissue and myelin loss. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence for the importance of IgM immunoglobulin in modulating recovery after SCI and suggests that modulating IgM could be a novel therapeutic approach to enhance recovery after SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Antibiotic Drug screening and Image Characterization Toolbox (A.D.I.C.T.): a robust imaging workflow to monitor antibiotic stress response in bacterial cells in vivo [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The search for novel drugs that efficiently eliminate prokaryotic pathogens is one of the most urgent health topics of our time. Robust evaluation methods for monitoring the antibiotic stress response in prokaryotes are therefore necessary for developing respective screening strategies. Besides advantages of common in vitro techniques, there is a growing demand for in vivo information based on imaging techniques that allow to screen antibiotic candidates in a dynamic manner. Gathering information from imaging data in a reproducible manner, robust data processing and analysis workflows demand advanced (semi-)automation and data management to increase reproducibility. Here we demonstrate a versatile and robust semi-automated image acquisition, processing and analysis workflow to investigate bacterial cell morphology in a quantitative manner. The presented workflow, A.D.I.C.T, covers aspects of experimental setup deployment, data acquisition and handling, image processing (e.g. ROI management, data transformation into binary images, background subtraction, filtering, projections) as well as statistical evaluation of the cellular stress response (e.g. shape measurement distributions, cell shape modeling, probability density evaluation of fluorescence imaging micrographs) towards antibiotic-induced stress, obtained from time-course experiments. The imaging workflow is based on regular brightfield images combined with live-cell imaging data gathered from bacteria, in our case from recombinant Shewanella cells, which are processed as binary images. The model organism expresses target proteins relevant for membrane-biogenesis that are functionally fused to respective fluorescent proteins. Data processing and analysis are based on customized scripts using ImageJ2/FIJI, Celltool and R packages that can be easily reproduced and adapted by users. Summing up, our approach aims at supporting life-scientists to establish their own imaging-pipeline in order to exploit their data as versatile as possible and in a reproducible manner.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">FiCoS: A fine-grained and coarse-grained GPU-powered deterministic simulator for biochemical networks</a></h4>

Mathematical models of biochemical networks can largely facilitate the comprehension of the mechanisms at the basis of cellular processes, as well as the formulation of hypotheses that can be tested by means of targeted laboratory experiments. However, two issues might hamper the achievement of fruitful outcomes. On the one hand, detailed mechanistic models can involve hundreds or thousands of molecular species and their intermediate complexes, as well as hundreds or thousands of chemical reactions, a situation generally occurring in rule-based modeling. On the other hand, the computational analysis of a model typically requires the execution of a large number of simulations for its calibration or to test the effect of perturbations. As a consequence, the computational capabilities of modern Central Processing Units can be easily overtaken, possibly making the modeling of biochemical networks a worthless or ineffective effort. To the aim of overcoming the limitations of the current state-of-the-art simulation approaches, we present in this paper FiCoS, a novel “black-box” deterministic simulator that effectively realizes both a fine-grained and a coarse-grained parallelization on Graphics Processing Units. In particular, FiCoS exploits two different integration methods, namely, the Dormand–Prince and the Radau IIA, to efficiently solve both non-stiff and stiff systems of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations. We tested the performance of FiCoS against different deterministic simulators, by considering models of increasing size and by running analyses with increasing computational demands. FiCoS was able to dramatically speedup the computations up to 855×, showing to be a promising solution for the simulation and analysis of large-scale models of complex biological processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ergodicity-breaking reveals time optimal decision making in humans</a></h4>

Ergodicity describes an equivalence between the expectation value and the time average of observables. Applied to human behaviour, ergodic theories of decision-making reveal how individuals should tolerate risk in different environments. To optimise wealth over time, agents should adapt their utility function according to the dynamical setting they face. Linear utility is optimal for additive dynamics, whereas logarithmic utility is optimal for multiplicative dynamics. Whether humans approximate time optimal behavior across different dynamics is unknown. Here we compare the effects of additive versus multiplicative gamble dynamics on risky choice. We show that utility functions are modulated by gamble dynamics in ways not explained by prevailing decision theories. Instead, as predicted by time optimality, risk aversion increases under multiplicative dynamics, distributing close to the values that maximise the time average growth of in-game wealth. We suggest that our findings motivate a need for explicitly grounding theories of decision-making on ergodic considerations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Personalized brain stimulation for effective neurointervention across participants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nienke E. R. van Bueren, Thomas L. Reed, Vu Nguyen, James G. Sheffield, Sanne H. G. van der Ven, Michael A. Osborne, Evelyn H. Kroesbergen, Roi Cohen Kadosh</p>

Accumulating evidence from human-based research has highlighted that the prevalent one-size-fits-all approach for neural and behavioral interventions is inefficient. This approach can benefit one individual, but be ineffective or even detrimental for another. Studying the efficacy of the large range of different parameters for different individuals is costly, time-consuming and requires a large sample size that makes such research impractical and hinders effective interventions. Here an active machine learning technique is presented across participants—personalized Bayesian optimization (pBO)—that searches available parameter combinations to optimize an intervention as a function of an individual’s ability. This novel technique was utilized to identify transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) frequency and current strength combinations most likely to improve arithmetic performance, based on a subject’s baseline arithmetic abilities. The pBO was performed across all subjects tested, building a model of subject performance, capable of recommending parameters for future subjects based on their baseline arithmetic ability. pBO successfully searches, learns, and recommends parameters for an effective neurointervention as supported by behavioral, stimulation, and neural data. The application of pBO in human-based research opens up new avenues for personalized and more effective interventions, as well as discoveries of protocols for treatment and translation to other clinical and non-clinical domains.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human herpesvirus 8 molecular mimicry of ephrin ligands facilitates cell entry and triggers EphA2 signaling</a></h4>

Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is an oncogenic virus that enters cells by fusion of the viral and endosomal cellular membranes in a process mediated by viral surface glycoproteins. One of the cellular receptors hijacked by HHV-8 to gain access to cells is the EphA2 tyrosine kinase receptor, and the mechanistic basis of EphA2-mediated viral entry remains unclear. Using X-ray structure analysis, targeted mutagenesis, and binding studies, we here show that the HHV-8 envelope glycoprotein complex H and L (gH/gL) binds with subnanomolar affinity to EphA2 via molecular mimicry of the receptor’s cellular ligands, ephrins (Eph family receptor interacting proteins), revealing a pivotal role for the conserved gH residue E52 and the amino-terminal peptide of gL. Using FSI-FRET and cell contraction assays, we further demonstrate that the gH/gL complex also functionally mimics ephrin ligand by inducing EphA2 receptor association via its dimerization interface, thus triggering receptor signaling for cytoskeleton remodeling. These results now provide novel insight into the entry mechanism of HHV-8, opening avenues for the search of therapeutic agents that could interfere with HHV-8–related diseases.

<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the deadliest causal agent of malaria, caused more than half of the 229 million malaria cases worldwide in 2019. The emergence and spreading of frontline drug-resistant <i>Plasmodium</i> strains are challenging to overcome in the battle against malaria and raise urgent demands for novel antimalarial agents. The <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> formate–nitrite transporter (PfFNT) is a potential drug target due to its housekeeping role in lactate efflux during the intraerythrocytic stage. Targeting PfFNT, MMV007839 was identified as a lead compound that kills parasites at submicromolar concentrations. Here, we present 2 cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PfFNT, one with the protein in its apo form and one with it in complex with MMV007839, both at 2.3 Å resolution. Benefiting from the high-resolution structures, our study provides the molecular basis for both the lactate transport of PfFNT and the inhibition mechanism of MMV007839, which facilitates further antimalarial drug design.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Assessment of single-vessel cerebral blood velocity by phase contrast fMRI</a></h4>

Current approaches to high-field functional MRI (fMRI) provide 2 means to map hemodynamics at the level of single vessels in the brain. One is through changes in deoxyhemoglobin in venules, i.e., blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) fMRI, while the second is through changes in arteriole diameter, i.e., cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Here, we introduce cerebral blood flow–related velocity-based fMRI, denoted CBFv-fMRI, which uses high-resolution phase contrast (PC) MRI to form velocity measurements of flow. We use CBFv-fMRI in measure changes in blood velocity in single penetrating microvessels across rat parietal cortex. In contrast to the venule-dominated BOLD and arteriole-dominated CBV fMRI signals, CBFv-fMRI is comparable from both arterioles and venules. A single fMRI platform is used to map changes in blood pO<sub>2</sub> (BOLD), volume (CBV), and velocity (CBFv). This combined high-resolution single-vessel fMRI mapping scheme enables vessel-specific hemodynamic mapping in animal models of normal and diseased states and further has translational potential to map vascular dementia in diseased or injured human brains with ultra–high-field fMRI.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Exploratory graph analysis of the network data of the Ethereum blockchain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This research uses exploratory graph analysis to analyze the transaction data of the Ethereum network. This is achieved through network visualization and mathematical and statistical modelling of the network data. Methods: The dataset used in this study was extracted from the Ethereum in the BigQuery public dataset, specifically selected transactions in July 2019. The transactions were firstly modelled as network graphs and then visualized using the Kamada-Kawai and force-directed graphs layouts. Further modelling was explored with classical random graph and network block, with emphasis on network cohesion, hierarchical clustering and community membership. Results: Looking at the network visualization and hierarchical clustering of the data, the network shows 170 clusters, the largest having 135 members. Through random graph modelling the optimum number of clusters is shown to be 95. Referring to the generated dendrograms, notable large transactions center around the DRINK token, the Maximine Exchange, the Upbit2 Exchange and the IDEX Exchange, identified through public disclosure of their Ethereum addresses. The network graphs tend to go towards the DRINK smart contract and the Maximine Exchange, indicating deposit actions, while it is the opposite for the IDEX Exchange. Further analysis also shows a different number of communities than the expected number. Falling short of the expected 170 clusters, the model is not able to capture additional mechanism that may be present at the density and social interaction distribution level of the network. On the other hand, network block modelling shows only four major clusters out of the 170 expected clusters, an indication that the model is not able to capture the network sufficiently. Conclusions: The study was able to capture and model the interconnectedness of the system with its notion of elements, in this case, the transactions on the network.

     alt="Characterizing the hyper- and hypometabolism in temporal lobe epilepsy using multivariate machine learning"/>
<p>We applied multivariate linear support vector classification on voxel-wise glucose uptake measured through PET imaging, and effectively classified mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients from healthy controls (cross-validated accuracy &gt;95%). Both ipsilateral hypometabolism and contralateral hypermetabolism significantly contributed to the model, confirming the added values of metabolic abnormalities in assisting MTLE diagnosis through quantitative approaches.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common type of focal epilepsy, presenting both structural and metabolic abnormalities in the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe. While it has been demonstrated that the metabolic abnormalities in MTLE actually extend beyond the epileptogenic zone, how such multidimensional information is associated with the diagnosis of MTLE remains to be tested. Here, we explore the whole-brain metabolic patterns in 23 patients with MTLE and 24 healthy controls using [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging. Based on a multivariate machine learning approach, we demonstrate that the brain metabolic patterns can discriminate patients with MTLE from controls with a superior accuracy (&gt;95%). Importantly, voxels showing the most extreme contributing weights to the classification (i.e., the most important regional predictors) distribute across both hemispheres, involving both ipsilateral negative weights over the anterior part of lateral and medial temporal lobe, posterior insula, and lateral orbital frontal gyrus, and contralateral positive weights over the anterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and lingual gyrus. Through region-of-interest analyses, we verify that in patients with MTLE, the negatively weighted regions are hypometabolic, and the positively weighted regions are hypermetabolic, compared to controls. Interestingly, despite that both hypo- and hypermetabolism have mutually contributed to our model, they may reflect different pathological and/or compensative responses. For instance, patients with earlier age at epilepsy onset present greater hypometabolism in the ipsilateral inferior temporal gyrus, while we find no evidence of such association with hypermetabolism. In summary, quantitative models utilizing multidimensional brain metabolic information may provide additional assistance to presurgical workups in TLE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the support for XML dynamic updates using a hybridization labeling scheme (ORD-GAP) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As the standard for the exchange of data over the World Wide Web, it is important to ensure that the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) database is capable of supporting not only efficient query processing but also capable of enduring frequent data update operations over the dynamic changes of Web content. Most of the existing XML annotation is based on a labeling scheme to identify each hierarchical position of the XML nodes. This computation is costly as any updates will cause the whole XML tree to be re-labelled. This impact can be observed on large datasets. Therefore, a robust labeling scheme that avoids re-labeling is crucial. Method: Here, we present ORD-GAP (named after Order Gap), a robust and persistent XML labeling scheme that supports dynamic updates. ORD-GAP assigns unique identifiers with gaps in-between XML nodes, which could easily identify the level, Parent-Child (P-C), Ancestor-Descendant (A-D) and sibling relationship. ORD-GAP adopts the OrdPath labeling scheme for any future insertion. Results: We demonstrate that ORD-GAP is robust enough for dynamic updates, and have implemented it in three use cases: (i) left-most, (ii) in-between and (iii) right-most insertion. Experimental evaluations on DBLP dataset demonstrated that ORD-GAP outperformed existing approaches such as ORDPath and ME Labeling concerning database storage size, data loading time and query retrieval. On average, ORD-GAP has the best storing and query retrieval time. Conclusion: The main contributions of this paper are: (i) A robust labeling scheme named ORD-GAP that assigns certain gap between each node to support future insertion, and (ii) An efficient mapping scheme, which built upon ORD-GAP labeling scheme to transform XML into RDB effectively.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Constitutive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐deficiency causes a reduction in spine density in mouse dentate granule cells accompanied by homeostatic adaptations of spine head size</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa-568 filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited ∼20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This review aims to give an overview of what has been discovered so far and what still needs to be analyzed about how sex and gender affect the disease development. These two terms are often confused and indifferently used. In principle, the term “sex” refers to biological differences between males and females, specifically reproductive organs and their functions, while the term “gender” refers to the social context in which people live and which contributes to a subjective sexual identity, masculine or feminine. This dichotomy, however, is not so rigid and both sex and gender influence different aspects of human health, such as brain, health and aging and drug treatment and pharmacokinetics. In particular, we want to focus on genetic differences between men and women: indeed, the expression of the genes mapped on X chromosome or Y chromosome and all epigenetic interactions affect the diseases development. Finally, we will briefly outline sex and gender differences in clinical manifestations of three neurological diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and obsessive compulsive disorder. In the era of personalized medicine, we must not forget the importance of gender medicine to promote personalized care for any kind of patients.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have demonstrated low but increasing rates of data and code sharing within medical and health research disciplines. However, it remains unclear how commonly data and code are shared across all fields of medical and health research, as well as whether sharing rates are positively associated with implementation of progressive policies by publishers and funders, or growing expectations from the medical and health research community at large. Therefore this systematic review aims to synthesise the findings of medical and health science studies that have empirically investigated the prevalence of data or code sharing, or both. Objectives include the investigation of: (i) the prevalence of public sharing of research data and code alongside published articles (including preprints), (ii) the prevalence of private sharing of research data and code in response to reasonable requests, and (iii) factors associated with the sharing of either research output (e.g., the year published, the publisher’s policy on sharing, the presence of a data or code availability statement). It is hoped that the results will provide some insight into how often research data and code are shared publicly and privately, how this has changed over time, and how effective some measures such as the institution of data sharing policies and data availability statements have been in motivating researchers to share their underlying data and code.

                Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020. Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and Pearson’s correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC) in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March – July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44% respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of human capital and fund characteristics on mutual fund performance in Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The evolution of the mutual funds industry has changed investors’ perspective. Instead of just focusing on which fund performances are best, investors pay great attention to who is managing and delivering superior returns in their investment portfolios. Nonetheless, it is very scant of comprehensive studies concern with human capital managerial characteristics that link with fund performances. Hence, this study proposes the integration of fund performances, managerial characteristics, systematic risk, expense, and turnover ratio, with single and simultaneous equations based on asset pricing models. Methods: Using a sample of Malaysian fund managers, data from fund management companies, Thomson One database, and fund master prospectus over the periods of January 2012 to December 2014, the fund performance was measured using Jensen alpha (CAPM single factor), and Fama and French three-factor model on single and simultaneous equations. The examination was further carried out by employing the ordinary least squares and three-stage least squares methods. Results: The results suggest that for fund managers, holding a business degree was the key factor to determine the fund performance, while having Master’s degree was not the primary concern. Fund performance and risk behavior varied across fund managers of different gender. Conclusions: The expense ratio, turnover ratio, and fund objective were significantly correlated with fund performance. This study provides ultimate implications for fund management companies, when it comes to the efficient allocation of human capital. Fund management companies should focus more on the team-managed funds phenomenon, instead of on single-managed funds. Overall, this study provides significant guidance for the Malaysian Securities Commissions and fund management companies, to develop a more competent funds market in Malaysia. Specifically, by strengthening the fund industry policies, the typical agency problems, such as too-high managerial expenses, and excessive risk-taking can be alleviated.

                The still stubbornly high maternal mortality ratio challenges Indonesia to improve health program strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 target of a maternal mortality ratio below 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Indonesia has already adopted maternal-neonatal health experts’ recommendation of four core program strategies to reduce maternal mortality: (1) family planning with related reproductive health services; (2) skilled care during pregnancy and childbirth; (3) timely emergency obstetric care; and (4) immediate postnatal care (WHO, 1996). These four core strategies would reduce maternal mortality through reduced high-risk births. To be effective, however, these four core program strategies require continued strong quality assurance and central and local government support to ensure program effectiveness yielded towards widely accessible, sustained, quality family planning and maternal and neonatal emergency services. This paper provides evidence for the importance of family planning to help health program strategies to accelerate maternal mortality reduction.

                <p>Canavan disease is caused by <i>ASPA</i> mutations that diminish brain aspartoacylase activity, and is characterized by excessive brain storage of the aspartoacylase substrate N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) and by astroglial and intramyelinic vacuolation. Astroglia and arachnoid mater express NaDC3, encoded by <i>Slc13a3</i>, a sodium-coupled transporter for NAA and other dicarboxylates. Constitutive <i>Slc13a3</i> deletion in aspartoacylase-deficient Canavan disease mice prevents brain NAA over-accumulation, ataxia, and brain vacuolation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Orientation selectivity enhances context generalization and generative predictive coding in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Liu et al. report that a population of hippocampal place cells display selectivity to spatial context orientation and topology, which biases the discrimination and remapping between multiple contexts. Repeated experience within a context enhances its representation discriminability, while generalization across multiple contexts improves network predictability of future novel context representations.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Cocaine shifts dopamine D2 receptor sensitivity to gate conditioned behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Gong et al. find that cocaine selectively reduces the sensitivity of accumbens D2 receptors (D2Rs) by dynamically regulating G protein expression in D2-MSNs. These changes were independent of D2R levels and bidirectionally regulated cocaine seeking. This identifies that altered D2R sensitivity is an initial adaptation to cocaine exposure that in turn drives cocaine-seeking behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Oligodendrocytes enhance axonal energy metabolism by deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins through transcellular delivery of SIRT2</a></h4>

              
                Neurons require mechanisms to maintain axonal ATP. Chamberlain et al. identify an exosome-mediated transcellular pathway through which oligodendrocyte-derived sirtuin 2 is delivered to axons, enhancing bioenergetics by deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins for increased ATP generation. Revealing this pathway advances understanding of axonal energy maintenance in health and neurological disorders.

                Although much progress has been made in cancer treatment, the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer radioresistance (RR) as well as the biological signatures of radioresistant cancer cells still need to be clarified. In this regard, we discovered that breast, bladder, lung, neuroglioma and prostate 6 Gy X-ray resistant cancer cells were characterized by an increase of Lipid Droplet (LD) number and that the cells containing highest LDs showed the highest clonogenic potential after irradiation. Moreover, we observed that LD content was tightly connected with the iron metabolism and in particular with the presence of the ferritin heavy chain (FTH1). In fact, breast and lung cancer cells silenced for the FTH1 gene showed a reduction in the LD numbers and, by consequence, became radiosensitive. FTH1 overexpression as well as iron-chelating treatment by Deferoxamine were able to restore the LD amount and RR. Overall, these results provide evidence of a novel mechanism behind RR in which LDs and FTH1 are tightly connected to each other, a synergistic effect which might be worth deeply investigating in order to make cancer cells more radiosensitive and improve the efficacy of radiation treatments.

                Cyclic-di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is an important effector associated with acute-chronic infection transition in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Previously, we reported a signaling network SiaABCD which regulates biofilm formation by modulating c-di-GMP level. However, the mechanism for SiaD activation by SiaC remains elusive. Here we determine the crystal structure of SiaC-SiaD-GpCpp complex and revealed a unique mirror symmetric conformation: two SiaD form a dimer with long stalk domains, while four SiaC bind to the conserved motifs on the stalks of SiaD and stabilize the conformation for further enzymatic catalysis. Furthermore, SiaD alone exhibits an inactive pentamer conformation in solution, demonstrating that SiaC activates SiaD through a dynamic mechanism of promoting the formation of active SiaD dimers. Mutagenesis assay confirmed that the stalks of SiaD are necessary for its activation. Together, we reveal a novel mechanism for DGC activation, which clarifies the regulatory networks of c-di-GMP signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Witnessing the structural evolution of an RNA enzyme</a></h4>

              
                An RNA polymerase ribozyme that has been the subject of extensive directed evolution efforts has attained the ability to synthesize complex functional RNAs, including a full-length copy of its own evolutionary ancestor. During the course of evolution, the catalytic core of the ribozyme has undergone a major structural rearrangement, resulting in a novel tertiary structural element that lies in close proximity to the active site. Through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, structural probing, and deep sequencing analysis, the trajectory of evolution was seen to involve the progressive stabilization of the new structure, which provides the basis for improved catalytic activity of the ribozyme. Multiple paths to the new structure were explored by the evolving population, converging upon a common solution. Tertiary structural remodeling of RNA is known to occur in nature, as evidenced by the phylogenetic analysis of extant organisms, but this type of structural innovation had not previously been observed in an experimental setting. Despite prior speculation that the catalytic core of the ribozyme had become trapped in a narrow local fitness optimum, the evolving population has broken through to a new fitness locale, raising the possibility that further improvement of polymerase activity may be achievable.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MiSiC, a general deep learning-based method for the high-throughput cell segmentation of complex bacterial communities</a></h4>

              
                Studies of bacterial communities, biofilms and microbiomes, are multiplying due to their impact on health and ecology. Live imaging of microbial communities requires new tools for the robust identification of bacterial cells in dense and often inter-species populations, sometimes over very large scales. Here, we developed MiSiC, a general deep-learning-based 2D segmentation method that automatically segments single bacteria in complex images of interacting bacterial communities with very little parameter adjustment, independent of the microscopy settings and imaging modality. Using a bacterial predator-prey interaction model, we demonstrate that MiSiC enables the analysis of interspecies interactions, resolving processes at subcellular scales and discriminating between species in millimeter size datasets. The simple implementation of MiSiC and the relatively low need in computing power make its use broadly accessible to fields interested in bacterial interactions and cell biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The corticospinal tract primarily modulates sensory inputs in the mouse lumbar cord</a></h4>

              
                It is generally assumed that the main function of the corticospinal tract (CST) is to convey motor commands to bulbar or spinal motoneurons. Yet the CST has also been shown to modulate sensory signals at their entry point in the spinal cord through primary afferent depolarization (PAD). By sequentially investigating different routes of corticofugal pathways through electrophysiological recordings and an intersectional viral strategy, we here demonstrate that motor and sensory modulation commands in mice belong to segregated paths within the CST. Sensory modulation is executed exclusively by the CST via a population of lumbar interneurons located in the deep dorsal horn. In contrast, the cortex conveys the motor command via a relay in the upper spinal cord or supraspinal motor centers. At lumbar level, the main role of the CST is thus the modulation of sensory inputs, which is an essential component of the selective tuning of sensory feedback used to ensure well-coordinated and skilled movement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal calmodulin levels are controlled by CAMTA transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin (CaM) binds and regulates many proteins, including ion channels, CaM kinases, and calcineurin, according to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM levels. What regulates neuronal CaM levels, is, however, unclear. CaM-binding transcription activators (CAMTAs) are ancient proteins expressed broadly in nervous systems and whose loss confers pleiotropic behavioral defects in flies, mice, and humans. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that CAMTAs control neuronal CaM levels. The behavioral and neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling defects in mutants lacking <i>camt-1,</i> the sole <i>C. elegans</i> CAMTA, can be rescued by supplementing neuronal CaM. CAMT-1 binds multiple sites in the CaM promoter and deleting these sites phenocopies <i>camt-1</i>. Our data suggest CAMTAs mediate a conserved and general mechanism that controls neuronal CaM levels, thereby regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, physiology, and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enhanced Cas12a multi-gene regulation using a CRISPR array separator</a></h4>

              
                The type V-A Cas12a protein can process its CRISPR array, a feature useful for multiplexed gene editing and regulation. However, CRISPR arrays often exhibit unpredictable performance due to interference between multiple guide RNA (gRNAs). Here, we report that Cas12a array performance is hypersensitive to the GC content of gRNA spacers, as high-GC spacers can impair activity of the downstream gRNA. We analyze naturally occurring CRISPR arrays and observe that natural repeats always contain an AT-rich fragment that separates gRNAs, which we term a <i>CRISPR separator</i>. Inspired by this observation, we design short, AT-rich synthetic separators (<i>synSeparators</i>) that successfully remove the disruptive effects between gRNAs. We further demonstrate enhanced simultaneous activation of seven endogenous genes in human cells using an array containing the synSeparator. These results elucidate a previously underexplored feature of natural CRISPR arrays and demonstrate how nature-inspired engineering solutions can improve multi-gene control in mammalian cells.

                Reconsolidation enables the activity-dependent modification of memory traces and has been used to reverse addiction, fear memory, and pain hypersensitivity in animal models. We demonstrate that non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signalling in the spinal dorsal horn is sufficient to reverse pain hypersensitivity and necessary for pain modulation by spinal reconsolidation. These findings reveal a key process by which reconsolidation weakens memory traces that may be exploited in the treatment of pain and other disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Urgency disrupts cognitive control of human action</a></h4>

              
                Intelligent behavior requires cognitive control, the ability to act directed by goals despite competing action tendencies triggered by stimuli in the environment. For eye movements, it has recently been discovered that cognitive control is briefly disrupted in urgent situations (Salinas et al., 2019). In a time-window before an urgent response, participants could not help but look at a suddenly appearing visual stimulus, even though their goal was to look away from it. Urgency seemed to provoke a new visual-oculomotor phenomenon: A period in which saccadic eye movements are dominated by external stimuli, and uncontrollable by current goals. This period was assumed to arise from brain mechanisms controlling eye movements and spatial attention, such as those of the frontal eye field. Here, we show that the phenomenon is more general than previously thought. We found that urgency disrupted cognitive control also in well-investigated manual tasks, so that responses were dominated by goal-conflicting stimulus features. This dominance of behavior followed established trial-to-trial signatures of cognitive control that replicate across a variety of tasks. Thus together, these findings reveal that urgency temporarily impairs cognitive control in general, not only at brain mechanisms controlling eye movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TAAC - TMS Adaptable Auditory Control: a universal tool to mask TMS click</a></h4>

              
                Background Coupling transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) allows recording the EEG response to a direct, non-invasive cortical perturbation. However, obtaining a genuine TMS-evoked EEG potential requires controlling for several confounds, among which a main source is represented by the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) associated to the TMS discharge noise (TMS click). This contaminating factor can be in principle prevented by playing a masking noise through earphones. New method Here we release TMS Adaptable Auditory Control (TAAC), a highly flexible, open-source, Matlab-based interface that generates in real-time customized masking noises. TAAC creates noises starting from the stimulator-specific TMS click and tailors them to fit the individual, subject-specific click perception by mixing and manipulating the standard noises in both time and frequency domains. Results We showed that TAAC allows us to provide standard as well as customized noises able to effectively and safely mask the TMS click. Comparison with existing methods Here, we showcased two customized noises by comparing them to two standard noises previously used in the TMS literature (i.e., a white noise and a noise generated from the stimulator-specific TMS click only). For each, we quantified the Sound Pressure Level (SPL; measured by a Head and Torso Simulator - HATS) required to mask the TMS click in a population of 20 healthy subjects. Both customized noises were effective at safe (according to OSHA and NIOSH safety guidelines), lower SPLs with respect to standard noises. Conclusions At odds with previous methods, TAAC allows creating effective and safe masking noises specifically tailored on each TMS device and subject. The combination of TAAC with tools for the real-time visualization of TEPs can help control the influence of auditory confounds also in non-compliant patients. Finally, TAAC is a highly flexible and open-source tool, so it can be further extended to meet different experimental requirements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional characterization of the biogenic amine transporter system on human macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Monocyte-derived macrophages are key players in tissue homeostasis and disease regulated by a variety of signaling molecules. Recent literature has highlighted the ability for biogenic amines to regulate macrophage functions, but the mechanisms governing biogenic amine signaling on and around immune cells remains nebulous. In the central nervous system, biogenic amine transporters are regarded as the master regulators of neurotransmitter signaling. While we and others have shown macrophages express these transporters, relatively little is known of their function on these cells. To address these knowledge gaps, we interrogated the function of norepinephrine (NET) and dopamine (DAT) transporters on human monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that both NET and DAT are present and can uptake substrate from the extracellular space at baseline. Not only was DAT expressed in cultured macrophages, but it was also detected in a subset of intestinal macrophages in situ. Surprisingly, we discovered a NET-independent, DAT-mediated immuno-modulatory mechanism in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induced reverse transport of dopamine through DAT, engaging autocrine/paracrine signaling loop that regulated the macrophage response. Removing this signaling loop enhanced the pro-inflammatory response to LPS. Finally, we found that this DAT-immune axis was disrupted in disease. Collectively, our data introduce a novel role for DAT in the regulation of innate immunity during health and disease.

                Evidence for epigenetic regulation playing a role in Parkinson's disease (PD) is growing, particularly for DNA modifications. Approximately 90% of PD cases are due to a complex interaction between age, genes, and environmental factors, and epigenetic marks are thought to mediate the relationship between aging, genetics, the environment, and disease risk. To date, there are a small number of published genome-wide studies of DNA modifications in PD, but none accounted for cell-type or sex in their analyses. Given the hetereogeneity of bulk brain tissue samples and known sex differences in PD risk, progression, and severity, these are critical variables to account for. In this first genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an enriched neuronal population from PD post-mortem parietal cortex, we report sex-specific PD-associated methylation changes in PARK7 (DJ-1), SLC17A6 (VGLUT2), PTPRN2 (IA-2{beta}), NR4A2 (NURR1), and other genes involved in developmental pathways, neurotransmitter packaging and release, and axon and neuron projection guidance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">(Un)common space in infant neuroimaging studies: a systematic review of infant templates</a></h4>

              
                In neuroimaging, spatial normalization is an important step that maps an individuals brain onto a template brain permitting downstream statistical analyses. Yet, in infant neuroimaging, there remain several technical challenges that have prevented the establishment of a standardized template for spatial normalization. Thus, many different approaches are used in the literature. To quantify the popularity and variability of these approaches in infant neuroimaging studies, we performed a systematic review of infant MRI studies from 2000 to 2020. Here, we present results from 833 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were classified into 1) processing data in single subject space, 2) using a predefined, or off the shelf, template, 3) creating a study specific template or 4) using a hybrid of these methods. We found that across the studies in the systematic review, single subject space was the most used (no common space). This was the most used common space for DWI and structural MRI studies while fMRI studies preferred off the shelf atlases. We found a pattern such that more recently published studies are more commonly using off the shelf atlases. When considering special populations, preterm studies most used single subject space while, when no special populations were being analyzed, an off the shelf template was most common. The most used off the shelf templates were the UNC Infant Atlases (26.1 percent). Using a systematic review of infant neuroimaging studies, we highlight a lack of an established standard template brain in these studies.

                Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin I to produce angiotensin II. In the brain, ACE is expressed at uniquely high levels in the striatonigral pathway, but its central function remains poorly understood. We find that ACE degrades an unconventional enkephalin heptapeptide, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, in the nucleus accumbens of mice. ACE inhibition enhanced mu opioid receptor activation by Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, causing a cell type-specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto medium spiny projection neurons expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor. Systemic ACE inhibition was not intrinsically rewarding, but decreased the conditioned place preference caused by fentanyl administration, and enhanced reciprocal social interaction. Our results raise the enticing prospect that central ACE inhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit, while mitigating risk of addiction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible Path Planning through Vicarious Trial and Error</a></h4>

              
                Flexible planning is necessary for reaching goals and adapting when conditions change. We introduce a biologically plausible path planning model that learns its environment, rapidly adapts to change, and plans efficient routes to goals. Unlike prior models of hippocamapl replay, our model addresses the decision-making process when faced with uncertainty. We tested the model in simulations of human and rodent navigation in mazes. Like the human and rat, the model was able to generate novel shortcuts, and take detours when familiar routes were blocked. Similar to rodent hippocampus recordings, the neural activity of the model resembles neural correlates of Vicarious Trial and Error (VTE) during early learning or during uncertain conditions. Similar to rodent studies, after learning, the neural activity resembles forward replay or preplay predicting a future route, and VTE activity decreases. We suggest that VTE, in addition to weighing possible outcomes, is a way in which an organism may gather information for future use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of a stress-sensitive anorexigenic neurocircuit from medial prefrontal cortex to lateral hypothalamus in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Animal models that examine neural circuits controlling food intake often lack translational relevance. To address this limitation, we identified neural network dynamics related to homeostatic state and BMI in humans. This approach predicted a novel pathway projecting from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) in humans. We then dissected the mechanistic underpinnings of this human-relevant mPFC-LH circuit in mice. Chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of the mPFC-LH pathway in mice suppressed food intake and motivated sucrose-seeking. Fibre photometry demonstrated this pathway was active in response to acute stress or prior to novel environment or object exposure, suggesting a role in the predictive assessment of potential threat. Food consumption suppressed mPFC-LH neuronal activity, independent of metabolic state or palatability. Finally, inhibition of this circuit increased feeding and motivated behaviour under mild stress and chronic ablation caused weight gain. These studies identify the mPFC-LH as a novel stress-sensitive anorexigenic neural pathway involved in the cortical control of food intake and motivated reward-seeking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genome-wide transcriptional profiling uncovers a similar oligodendrocyte-related transcriptional response to acute and chronic alcohol drinking in the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol intake progressively increases after prolonged consumption of alcohol, but relatively few new therapeutics targeting development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been validated. Here, we conducted a genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in mice exposed to different modes (acute vs chronic) of ethanol drinking. We focused on transcriptional profiles in the amygdala including the central and basolateral subnuclei, a brain area previously implicated in alcohol drinking and seeking, demonstrating distinct gene expression patterns and canonical pathways induced by both acute and chronic intake. Surprisingly, both drinking modes triggered similar transcriptional changes, including up-regulation of ribosome-related/translational pathways and myelination pathways, and down-regulation of chromatin binding and histone modification. Notably, multiple genes that were significantly regulated in mouse amygdala with alcohol drinking, including Atp2b1, Slc4a7, Nfkb1, Nts, and Hdac2, among others had previously been associated with human AUD via GWAS or other genomic studies. In addition, analyses of hub genes and upstream regulatory pathways predicted that voluntary ethanol consumption affects epigenetic changes via histone deacetylation pathways, oligodendrocyte and myelin function, and oligodendrocyte-related transcriptional factor, Sox17. Overall, our results suggest that the transcriptional landscape in the central and basolateral subnuclei of the amygdala is sensitive to voluntary alcohol drinking. They provide a unique resource of gene expression data for future translational studies examining transcriptional mechanisms underlying the development of AUD due to alcohol consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG-Based Spectral Analysis ShowingBrainwave Changes Related to ModulatingProgressive Fatigue During a ProlongedIntermittent Motor Task</a></h4>

              
                Repeatedly performing a submaximal motor task for a prolonged period of time leads to muscle fatigue manifested by its reduced capacity to generate force or power. Fatigue resulted from voluntary muscle contractions comprises a central and peripheral component, which demands a gradually increasing effort to perform the task as time elapses. However, we still lack a complete understanding of brain contribution to the enhancement of effort to cope with progressing fatigue because of repeated submaximal muscle contractions. The knowledge of how muscle fatigue modulates brain activities in a healthy population will help rationalize why certain patients experience exacerbated fatigue while carrying out mundane tasks. The intermittent motor tasks closely resemble many activities of daily living (ADL), thus remaining physiologically relevant to study fatigue. The scope of this study is therefore to investigate the EEG-based brain activation patterns in healthy subjects performing intermittent submaximal muscle contractions until self-perceived exhaustion. Fourteen participants (median age 51.5 years; age range 26-72 years; 5 males) repeated elbow flexion contractions at 40% maximum voluntary contraction by following visual cues displayed on an oscilloscope screen until subjective exhaustion. Each contraction lasted ~5 s with a 2-s rest between trials. The force, EEG, and surface EMG (from elbow joint muscles) data were simultaneously collected. After preprocessing, we selected a subset of trials at the beginning, middle, and end of the study session representing brain activities germane to mild, moderate, and severe fatigue conditions, respectively, to compare and contrast the changes in the EEG time-frequency (TF) characteristics across the conditions. The TF analyses were conducted both at the channel and source level. The outcome of the channel- and source-level analyses reveal that the theta, alpha, and beta power spectral densities (PSDs) vary in proportion to fatigue levels in cortical motor areas. Importantly, the pairwise PSD differences between the fatigue conditions survived the statistical inferential tests with a p-value threshold of 0.05. We observed a statistically significant change in the band-specific spectral power in relation to the graded fatigue from both the steady- and post- contraction EEG data. The findings would enhance our understanding of the etiology and physiology of voluntary motor action-related fatigue and provide pointers to counteract the perception of muscle weakness and lack of motor endurance associated with ADL. The study outcome would help evaluate how clinical conditions such as neurological disorders and cancer treatment alter neural mechanisms underlying fatigue in future studies and develop therapeutic strategies for restoring the patients' ability to participate in ADL by mitigating central and muscle fatigue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaPTure: Calcium Peak Toolbox for analysis of in vitro calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Background: Calcium imaging is a powerful technique for recording cellular activity across large populations of neurons. However, analysis methods capable of single-cell resolution in cultured neurons, especially for cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are lacking. Existing methods lack scalability to accommodate high-throughput comparisons between multiple lines, across developmental timepoints, or across pharmacological manipulations. Results: We developed a scalable, automated Ca2+ imaging analysis pipeline called CaPTure (https://github.com/LieberInstitute/CaPTure). This method detects neurons, classifies and quantifies spontaneous activity, quantifies synchrony metrics, and generates cell- and network-specific metrics that facilitate phenotypic discovery. The method is compatible with parallel processing on computing clusters without requiring significant user input or parameter modification. Conclusion: CaPTure allows for rapid assessment of neuronal activity in cultured cells at cellular resolution, rendering it amenable to high-throughput screening and phenotypic discovery. The platform can be applied to both human- and rodent-derived neurons and is compatible with many imaging systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beyond traditional visual sleep scoring: massive feature extraction and unsupervised clustering of sleep time series</a></h4>

              
                The widely used guidelines for sleep staging were developed for the visual inspection of electrophysiological recordings by the human eye. As such, these rules reflect only a limited range of features in these data and are therefore restricted in accurately capturing the physiological changes that occur during sleep. Here we present a novel analysis framework that extensively characterizes sleep dynamics using over 7700 time-series features from the hctsa software package. We used clustering to categorize sleep epochs based on the similarity of their time-series features, without relying on established scoring conventions. The resulting sleep structure overlapped substantially with that defined by visual scoring. However, we also observed considerable discrepancies between our approach and traditional scoring. This divergence principally stemmed from the extensive characterization by hctsa time-series features, which captured distinctive time-series properties within the traditionally defined sleep stages that are overlooked with visual scoring. Lastly, we report time-series features that are highly discriminative of sleep stages. The data-driven approach identifies powerful individual time-series features that both recapitulate existing knowledge about sleep stage identification and highlight novel time-series analysis methods. Our framework lays the groundwork for a data-driven exploration of sleep sub-stages and has significant potential to identify new signatures of sleep disorders and conscious sleep states, such as dreaming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent Multimodal Data Acquisition During Brain Scanning is within Reach</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous brain-scanning research exploring the neural mechanisms underpinning visuomotor planning and control has mostly been done without simultaneous motion-tracking and eye-tracking. Employing concurrent methodologies would enhance understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying visuomotor integration of cognitive, visual, ocular, and motor aspects of reaching and grasping behaviours. Therefore, this work presents the methods and validation for a high-speed, multimodal and synchronized system to holistically examine neural processes that are involved in visually-guided movement. Methods: The multimodal methods included high speed 3D motion tracking (Qualisys), 2D eye-tracking (SR Research), and magnetoencephalography (MEG; Elekta) that were synchronized to millisecond precision. Previous MRIs were taken to provide improved spatial localization. The methods section describes the system layout and acquisition parameters to achieve multimodal synchronization. Pilot results presented here are preliminary data from a larger study including 29 participants. Using a pincer grip, five people (3 male, 2 female, ages 30-32) reached for and grasped a translucent dowel 50 times, after it was pseudorandomly illuminated. The object illumination was the Go cue. Seven discrete time points (events) throughout the task were chosen for investigation of simultaneous brain, hand and eye activity associated with specific visual (Go cue), oculomotor (1st saccade after Go), motor (Reaction Time; RT, Maximum Velocity: MV, Maximum Grip Width; MGW) or cognitive (Ready, End) mechanisms. Time-frequency analyses were performed on the MEG data sourced from the left precentral gyrus to explore task-related changes time-locked to these chosen events. Pilot results: Basic kinematic parameters including RT, MV, MGW, Movement Time, and Total Time were similar to previous, seminal research by Castiello, Paulignan and Jeannerod, (1991), using a similar task. Although no gaze instructions were given, eye-tracking results indicated volunteers mostly gazed at or near the target object when Ready (72%), and then hardly looked away throughout the rest of the task at the important events sampled here (92% - 98%). At the End event, when lifting the dowel, on average, participants gazed at or near the target object 100% of the time. Although saccades > 100 ms after Go, but prior to RT were made on average in about one fourth (M = 13, SD = 6) of trials, a mixed model (REML) indicated their latency in timing after the Go was significantly (F = 13.376, p = .001) associated with RT scores on those trials (AIC = 724, R m2 = 0.407, Rc2= 0.420). Neural activity relative to baseline in the beta band was desynchronized for the visually guided reach periods, beginning prior to Go, and remaining sustained until beyond End, after the grasp and lift were executed. Conclusion: This study presents the layout, acquisition parameters and validation for a multimodal, synchronized system designed to record data from the hand, eye and brain simultaneously, with millisecond precision during an ecologically-valid prehension task with physical, 3D objects. The pilot results align with previous research made with single or bimodal data recordings. This multimodal method enables full-brain modelling that can holistically map the precise location and timing of neural activity involved in the visual, oculomotor, motor and cognitive aspects of reach-to-grasp planning and control.

	<p>Objective: To identify possible relevant factors contributing to tremor relapse after MRgFUS thalamotomy in patients with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods: We identified patients with tremor relapse from a series of 79 treatments in a single institution. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study group patients were compared to those of patients who did not relapse in the same follow-up period. Imaging and procedural factors were compared using a control group matched for clinical and demographic characteristics. Results: Concerning clinical and demographic characteristics, we did not find statistically significant differences in gender and age. Seventy-three percent of patients with tremor relapse were Parkinson’s disease patients. Using MRI, we found larger thalamotomy lesions at the 1-year follow-up in the control group with stable outcomes, compared to patients with tremor relapse. In the tractography evaluation, we found a more frequent eccentric position of the DRTt in patients with tremor relapse. Conclusions: The most relevant determining factors for tremor relapse after MRgFUS thalamotomy appear to be tremor from Parkinson’s disease and inaccurate thalamic targeting. Size of the thalamotomy lesion can also influence the outcome of treatment.</p>

	<p>The development of mobile technology and mobile Internet offers new possibilities in rehabilitation and clinical assessment in a longitudinal perspective for multiple sclerosis management. However, because the mobile health applications (mHealth) have only been developed recently, the level of evidence supporting the use of mHealth in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is currently unclear. Therefore, this review aims to list and describe the different mHealth available for rehabilitation and self-assessment of pwMS and to define the level of evidence supporting these interventions for functioning problems categorized within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). In total, 36 studies, performed with 22 different mHealth, were included in this review, 30 about rehabilitation and six for self-assessment, representing 3091 patients. For rehabilitation, most of the studies were focusing on cognitive function and fatigue. Concerning the efficacy, we found a small but significant effect of the use of mHealth for cognitive training (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.28 [0.12; 0.45]) and moderate effect for fatigue (SMD = 0.61 [0.47; 0.76]). mHealth is a promising tool in pwMS but more studies are needed to validate these solutions in the other ICF categories. More replications studies are also needed as most of the mHealth have only been assessed in one single study.</p>

	<p>Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) describes the reduction in pain evoked by a test stimulus (TS) when presented together with a heterotopic painful conditioning stimulus (CS). CPM has been proposed to reflect inter-individual differences in endogenous pain modulation, which may predict susceptibility for acute and chronic pain. Here, we aimed to estimate the relative variance in CPM explained by inter-individual differences compared to age, sex, and CS physical and pain intensity. We constructed linear and mixed effect models on pooled data from 171 participants of several studies, of which 97 had repeated measures. Cross-sectional analyses showed no significant effect of age, sex or CS intensity. Repeated measures analyses revealed a significant effect of CS physical intensity (p = 0.002) but not CS pain intensity (p = 0.159). Variance decomposition showed that inter-individual differences accounted for 24% to 34% of the variance in CPM while age, sex, and CS intensity together explained &amp;amp;lt;3% to 12%. In conclusion, the variance in CPM explained by inter-individual differences largely exceeds that of commonly considered factors such as age, sex and CS intensity. This may explain why predictive capability of these factors has had conflicting results and suggests that future models investigating them should account for inter-individual differences.</p>

	<p>In previous studies, a below-average, average, or above-average intelligence quotient (IQ) in children with SMA was detected but, aside from a severe physical disability, the cognitive performance of adult SMA patients has not yet been evaluated. The intelligence test used in this study, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, fourth edition (WAIS-IV), was used to measure major intelligence components of adult SMA patients. The WAIS-IV determines four index scores representing verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Due to time-dependent demands on motor function, the processing speed index score was excluded. IQ index scores of 33 adult SMA patients did not differ from IQ index scores of the normal population. In SMA type-3 patients, the index scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and working memory did not differ from the normal population but showed a trend of IQ scores towards lower points. Patients with SMA type 2 had lower IQ index scores for working memory (90.33 ± 12.95; p = 0.012) and perceptual reasoning (90.73 ± 12.58; p = 0.013) than the normal population. This study provided further evidence that SMA is a multi-systemic disease and may refute the widespread hypothesis that SMA patients might improve their cognitive skills to compensate for their physical impairment.</p>

	<p>We examined the roles self-efficacy plays in environmental learning in terms of self-efficacy feedback and task-specific (navigation-based) self-efficacy. We manipulated self-efficacy using positive and neutral feedback to investigate the relationship between receiving positive feedback and environmental learning performance and subsequent recall. A total of 231 participants were administered visuospatial tasks, where 117 received positive feedback, and 114 received neutral feedback. Then, we tested environmental learning using route retracing, pointing, and map-completion tasks. Before each environmental task, participants evaluated their task-specific self-efficacy. A series of spatial self-reported preferences were gathered as well. Mediation models showed that receiving positive feedback after a visuospatial task influences environmental recall performance through the mediation of task-specific self-efficacy. Moreover, after accounting for experimental manipulation and gender, we found that task-specific self-efficacy, sense of direction, and visuospatial abilities influence spatial-recall task performance, even with some differences as a function of the specific recall tasks considered. Overall, our findings suggest that among individual characteristics, task-specific self-efficacy can sustain environmental learning. Furthermore, giving positive feedback can improve spatial self-efficacy before conducting spatial-recall tasks.</p>

     alt="Isoxazole-9 reduces enhanced fear responses and retrieval in ethanol-dependent male rats"/>
<p>This study used an established animal model of ethanol dependence and found that abstinence from ethanol experience alters fear memory consolidation and plasticity in the hippocampus. Treatment with small molecule isoxazole-9 prevented the altered fear responses during abstinence and normalized cellular and plasticity changes in the ventral dentate gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) is strongly influenced by ethanol, and ethanol experience alters long-term memory consolidation dependent on the DG. However, it is unclear if DG plasticity plays a role in dysregulation of long-term memory consolidation during abstinence from chronic ethanol experience. Outbred male Wistar rats experienced 7 weeks of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE). Seventy-two hours after CIE cessation, CIE and age-matched ethanol-naïve Air controls experienced auditory trace fear conditioning (TFC). Rats were tested for cue-mediated retrieval in the fear context either twenty-four hours (24 hr), ten days (10 days), or twenty-one days (21 days) later. CIE rats showed enhanced freezing behavior during TFC acquisition compared to Air rats. Air rats showed significant fear retrieval, and this behavior did not differ at the three time points. In CIE rats, fear retrieval increased over time during abstinence, indicating an incubation in fear responses. Enhanced retrieval at 21 days was associated with reduced structural and functional plasticity of ventral granule cell neurons (GCNs) and reduced expression of synaptic proteins important for neuronal plasticity. Systemic treatment with the drug Isoxazole-9 (Isx-9; small molecule that stimulates DG plasticity) during the last week and a half of CIE blocked altered acquisition and retrieval of fear memories in CIE rats during abstinence. Concurrently, Isx-9 modulated the structural and functional plasticity of ventral GCNs and the expression of synaptic proteins in the ventral DG. These findings identify that abstinence-induced disruption of fear memory consolidation occurs via altered plasticity within the ventral DG, and that Isx-9 prevented these effects.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of emotional responses such as fear, and a number of studies have implicated endocannabinoid signaling in anxiety. The fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) C385A polymorphism, which is associated with enhanced endocannabinoid signaling in the brain, has been identified across species as a potential protective factor from anxiety. In particular, adults with the variant FAAH 385A allele have greater fronto-amygdala connectivity and lower anxiety symptoms. Whether broader network-level differences in connectivity exist, and when during development this neural phenotype emerges, remains unknown and represents an important next step in understanding how the FAAH C385A polymorphism impacts neurodevelopment and risk for anxiety disorders. Here, we leveraged data from 3,109 participants in the nationwide Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study℠ (10.04 ± 0.62 years old; 44.23% female, 55.77% male) and a cross-validated, data-driven approach to examine associations between genetic variation and large-scale resting-state brain networks. Our findings revealed a distributed brain network, comprising functional connections that were both significantly greater (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [&lt;0.001, &lt;0.001]) and lesser (95% CI for <i>p</i> values = [0.006, &lt;0.001]) in A-allele carriers relative to non-carriers. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between genotype and the summarized connectivity of functional connections that were greater in A-allele carriers, such that non-carriers with connectivity more similar to A-allele carriers (i.e., greater connectivity) had lower anxiety symptoms (<i>β</i> = −0.041, <i>p</i> = 0.030). These findings provide novel evidence of network-level changes in neural connectivity associated with genetic variation in endocannabinoid signaling and suggest that genotype-associated neural differences may emerge at a younger age than genotype-associated differences in anxiety.</p>

<p>MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to model schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotypes. Here we compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish behavioral assays. We found that MK-801 disrupted social interaction and altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. Exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia pathophysiology has been associated with dopaminergic hyperactivity, NMDA receptor hypofunction, and redox dysregulation. Most behavioral assays and animal models to study this condition were developed in rodents, leaving room for species-specific biases that could be avoided by cross-species approaches. As MK-801 and amphetamine are largely used in mice and rats to mimic schizophrenia features, this study aimed to compare the effects of these drugs in several zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) behavioral assays. Male and female adult zebrafish were exposed to MK-801 (1, 5, and 10 μM) or amphetamine (0.625, 2.5, and 10 mg/L) and observed in paradigms of locomotor activity and social behavior. Oxidative parameters were quantified in brain tissue. Our results demonstrate that MK-801 disrupted social interaction, an effect that resembles the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It also altered locomotion in a context-dependent manner, with hyperactivity when fish were tested in the presence of social cues and hypoactivity when tested alone. On the other hand, exposure to amphetamine was devoid of effects on locomotion and social behavior, while it increased lipid peroxidation in the brain. Key outcomes induced by MK-801 in rodents, such as social interaction deficit and locomotor alterations, were replicated in zebrafish, corroborating previous studies and reinforcing the use of zebrafish to study schizophrenia-related endophenotypes. More studies are necessary to assess the predictive validity of preclinical paradigms with this species and ultimately optimize the screening of potential novel treatments.</p>

<p>We used retrograde and anterograde tracing techniques, along with immunocytochemistry, to delineate the sources of cholinergic brainstem projections to the dorsal thalamus of the mouse. Shown are the pattern of cholinergic projections from the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG; red), pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg; blue), and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg; brown) to contralateral and ipsilateral dorsal thalamic nuclei, including dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), pulvinar (PUL), ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), ventrobasal complex (VB), and posterior nucleus (Po). Brainstem nuclei are depicted as boxes and indicate immunoreactivity to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projections from the brainstem serve as important modulators of activity in visual thalamic nuclei such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). While these projections have been studied in several mammals, a comprehensive examination of their organization in the mouse is lacking. We used the retrograde transport of viruses or cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) injected in the dLGN, immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), brain nitric oxide synthase (BNOS), and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), ChAT-Cre mice crossed with a reporter line (Ai9), as well as brainstem virus injections in ChAT-Cre mice to examine the pattern of thalamic innervation from cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), and the parabigeminal nucleus (PBG). Retrograde tracing demonstrated that the dLGN receives input from the PPTg, LDTg, and PBG. Viral tracing in ChAT-Cre mice and retrograde tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that many of these inputs originate from cholinergic neurons in the PBG and PPTg. Most notable was an extensive cholinergic projection from the PBG which innervated most of the contralateral dLGN, with an especially dense concentration in the dorsolateral shell, as well as a small region in the dorsomedial pole of the ipsilateral dLGN. The PPTg was found to provide a sparse somewhat diffuse innervation of the ipsilateral dLGN. Neurons in the PPTg co-expressed ChAT, BNOS, and VAChT, whereas PBG neurons expressed ChAT, but not BNOS or VAChT. These results highlight the presence of distinct cholinergic populations that innervate the mouse dLGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Comparison of Ciliary Targeting of Two Rhodopsin-Like GPCRs: Role of C-Terminal Localization Sequences in Relation to Cilium Type</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primary cilia exhibit a distinct complement of proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate sensory and developmental signals. The localization of GPCRs to the ciliary membrane involves ciliary localization sequences (CLSs), but it is not known how CLSs might relate to cilium type. Here, we studied the localization of two rhodopsin (RHO)-like GPCRs, somatostatin receptor (SSTR3) and RHO, in three types of cilia, from inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells, hTERT-RPE1 cells (possessing pocket cilia), and rod photoreceptors (whose cilia grow into elaborate phototransductive outer segments). SSTR3 was localized specifically to all three types of cilia, whereas RHO showed more selectivity for the photoreceptor cilium. Focusing on C-terminal CLSs, we characterized a novel CLS in the SSTR3 C terminus, which was required for the robust ciliary localization of SSTR3. Replacing the C terminus of RHO with this SSTR3 CLS-enhanced ciliary localization, compared with full-length RHO in IMCD3 and hTERT-RPE1 cells. Addition of the SSTR3 CLS to the single transmembrane protein CD8A enabled ciliary localization. In hTERT-RPE1 cells, a partial SSTR3 CLS added to CD8A effected specific localization to the periciliary (pocket) membrane, demonstrating C-terminal localization sequence targeting to this domain. Using retinas from mice, including both sexes, we show that deletion of the C terminus of RHO reduced the rod outer segment localization and that addition of the SSTR3 C-terminal CLS to the truncated RHO partly rescued this mislocalization. Overall, the study details elements of the different C termini of SSTR3 and RHO that are major effectors in determining specificity of cilium (or pericilium) localization among different types of cilia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The localization of G-protein-coupled receptors to primary cilia is key to many types of signal transduction. After characterizing a novel C-terminal CLS in SSTR3, we investigated how SSTR3 and RHO localization to the cilium relates to C-terminal CLSs and to cilium type. We found that the SSTR3 C-terminal CLS was effective in three different types of cilia, but the RHO C terminus showed a clear localization preference for the highly elaborate photoreceptor cilium. When added to CD8A, part of the SSTR3 CLS promoted specific periciliary membrane localization in hTERT-RPE1 cells, demonstrating an effective CLS for this domain. Thus, we demonstrate that elements of the C termini of SSTR3 and RHO determine different localization patterns among different types of cilia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Acetaldehyde Excitation of Lateral Habenular Neurons via Multiple Cellular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of ethanol, is implicated in several of ethanol's actions, including the reinforcing and aversive effects. The neuronal mechanisms underlying ACD's aversive effect, however, are poorly understood. The lateral habenula (LHb), a regulator of midbrain monoaminergic centers, is activated by negative valence events. Although the LHb has been linked to the aversive responses of several abused drugs, including ethanol, little is known about ACD. We, therefore, assessed ACD's action on LHb neurons in rats. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of ACD increased cFos protein expression within the LHb and that intra-LHb infusion of ACD induced conditioned place aversion in male rats. Furthermore, electrophysiological recording in brain slices of male and female rats showed that bath application of ACD facilitated spontaneous firing and glutamatergic transmission. This effect of ACD was potentiated by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor, disulfiram (DS), but attenuated by the antagonists of dopamine (DA) receptor (DAR) subtype 1 (SCH23390) and subtype 2 (raclopride), and partly abolished by the pretreatment of DA or DA reuptake blocker (GBR12935; GBR). Moreover, application of ACD initiated a depolarizing inward current (<I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>) and enhanced the hyperpolarizing-activated currents in LHb neurons. Bath application of Rp-cAMPs, a selective cAMP-PKA inhibitor, attenuated ACD-induced potentiation of EPSCs and <I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>. Finally, bath application of ZD7288, a selective blocker of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, attenuated ACD-induced potentiation of firing, EPSCs, and <I>I</I><SUB>ACD</SUB>. These results show that ACD exerts its aversive property by exciting LHb neurons via multiple cellular mechanisms, and new treatments targeting the LHb may be beneficial for alcoholism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetaldehyde (ACD) has been considered aversive peripherally and rewarding centrally. However, whether ACD has a central aversive property is unclear. Here, we report that ACD excites the lateral habenula (LHb), a brain region associated with aversion and negative valence, through multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. Intra-LHb ACD produces significant conditioned place aversion. These results suggest that ACD's actions on the LHb neurons might contribute to its central aversive property and new treatments targeting the LHb may be beneficial for alcoholism.</p>

                <p>Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 calcium channels are expressed in nociceptors at presynaptic terminals, soma, and axons. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel inhibitors applied to the spinal cord relieve pain in humans and rodents, especially during pathologic pain, but a biological function of nociceptor Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in processing of nociception, outside presynaptic terminals in the spinal cord, is underappreciated. Here, we demonstrate that functional Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in peripheral axons innervating skin are required for capsaicin-induced heat hypersensitivity in male and female mice. We show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels in TRPV1-nociceptor endings are activated by capsaicin-induced depolarization and contribute to increased intracellular calcium. Capsaicin induces hypersensitivity of both thermal nociceptors and mechanoreceptors, but only heat hypersensitivity depends on peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity, and especially a cell-type-specific Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 splice isoform. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels at peripheral nerve endings might be important therapeutic targets to mitigate certain forms of chronic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is generally assumed that nociceptor termini in the spinal cord dorsal horn are the functionally significant sites of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel in control of transmitter release and the transmission of sensory information from the periphery to central sites. We show that peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are essential for the classic heat hypersensitivity response to develop in skin following capsaicin exposure. This function of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 is highly selective for heat, but not mechanical hypersensitivity induced by capsaicin exposure, and is not a property of closely related Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.1 channels. Our findings suggest that interrupting Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2-dependent calcium entry in skin might reduce heat hypersensitivity that develops after noxious heat exposure and may limit the degree of heat hypersensitivity associated with certain other forms of pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Emergent Population Code in Primary Auditory Cortex Supports Selective Attention to Spectral and Temporal Sound Features</a></h4>

              
                <p>Textbook descriptions of primary sensory cortex (PSC) revolve around single neurons' representation of low-dimensional sensory features, such as visual object orientation in primary visual cortex (V1), location of somatic touch in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and sound frequency in primary auditory cortex (A1). Typically, studies of PSC measure neurons' responses along few (one or two) stimulus and/or behavioral dimensions. However, real-world stimuli usually vary along many feature dimensions and behavioral demands change constantly. In order to illuminate how A1 supports flexible perception in rich acoustic environments, we recorded from A1 neurons while rhesus macaques (one male, one female) performed a feature-selective attention task. We presented sounds that varied along spectral and temporal feature dimensions (carrier bandwidth and temporal envelope, respectively). Within a block, subjects attended to one feature of the sound in a selective change detection task. We found that single neurons tend to be high-dimensional, in that they exhibit substantial mixed selectivity for both sound features, as well as task context. We found no overall enhancement of single-neuron coding of the attended feature, as attention could either diminish or enhance this coding. However, a population-level analysis reveals that ensembles of neurons exhibit enhanced encoding of attended sound features, and this population code tracks subjects' performance. Importantly, surrogate neural populations with intact single-neuron tuning but shuffled higher-order correlations among neurons fail to yield attention- related effects observed in the intact data. These results suggest that an emergent population code not measurable at the single-neuron level might constitute the functional unit of sensory representation in PSC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to adapt to a dynamic sensory environment promotes a range of important natural behaviors. We recorded from single neurons in monkey primary auditory cortex (A1), while subjects attended to either the spectral or temporal features of complex sounds. Surprisingly, we found no average increase in responsiveness to, or encoding of, the attended feature across single neurons. However, when we pooled the activity of the sampled neurons via targeted dimensionality reduction (TDR), we found enhanced population-level representation of the attended feature and suppression of the distractor feature. This dissociation of the effects of attention at the level of single neurons versus the population highlights the synergistic nature of cortical sound encoding and enriches our understanding of sensory cortical function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cross Laminar Traveling Components of Field Potentials due to Volume Conduction of Non-Traveling Neuronal Activity in Macaque Sensory Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Field potentials (FPs) reflect neuronal activities in the brain, and often exhibit traveling peaks across recording sites. While traveling FPs are interpreted as propagation of neuronal activity, not all studies directly reveal such propagating patterns of neuronal activation. Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane currents that form dipoles and produce negative and positive fields. Thereby, FP components reverse polarity between those fields and have minimal amplitudes at the center of dipoles. Although their amplitudes could be smaller, FPs are never flat even around these reversals. What occurs around the reversal has not been addressed explicitly, although those are rationally in the middle of active neurons. We show that sensory FPs around the reversal appeared with peaks traveling across cortical laminae in macaque sensory cortices. Interestingly, analyses of current source density did not depict traveling patterns but lamina-delimited current sinks and sources. We simulated FPs produced by volume conduction of a simplified 2 dipoles' model mimicking sensory cortical laminar current source density components. While FPs generated by single dipoles followed the temporal patterns of the dipole moments without traveling peaks, FPs generated by concurrently active dipole moments appeared with traveling components in the vicinity of dipoles by superimposition of individually non-traveling FPs generated by single dipoles. These results indicate that not all traveling FP are generated by traveling neuronal activity, and that recording positions need to be taken into account to describe FP peak components around active neuronal populations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Field potentials (FPs) generated by neuronal activity in the brain occur with fields of opposite polarity. Likewise, in the cerebral cortices, they have mirror-imaged waveforms in upper and lower layers. We show that FPs appear like traveling across the cortical layers. Interestingly, the traveling FPs occur without traveling components of current source density, which represents transmembrane currents associated with neuronal activity. These seemingly odd findings are explained using current source density models of multiple dipoles. Concurrently active, non-traveling dipoles produce FPs as mixtures of FPs produced by individual dipoles, and result in traveling FP waveforms as the mixing ratio depends on the distances from those dipoles. The results suggest that not all traveling FP components are associated with propagating neuronal activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Activity in the Premotor Cortex of Monkeys Reflects Both Cue Salience and Motivation for Action Generation and Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reward prospect weighs on motor decision processes, enhancing the selection of appropriate actions and the inhibition of others. While many studies have investigated the neuronal basis of reward representations and of cortical control of actions, the neuronal correlates of the influences of reward prospect on motor decisions are less clear. We recorded from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of 2 male macaque monkeys performing a modified version of the Stop-signal (countermanding) task. This task challenges motor decisions by requiring responding to a frequent Go stimulus, but to suppress this response when a rare Stop signal is presented during the reaction time. We unbalanced the motivation to respond or to suppress the response by presenting a cue informing on three different rewards schedules: in one case, Go trials were rewarded more than Stop trials; in another case, Stop trials were rewarded more than Go trials; in the last case, both types of trials were rewarded equally. Monkeys adopted different strategies according to reward information provided by the cue: the higher the reward for Stop trials, the higher their ability to suppress the response and the slower their response to Go stimuli. PMd neuronal activity evolved in time and correlated with the behavior: PMd signaled first the cue salience, representing the chance to earn the highest reward at stake, then reflected the shaping of the motor choice by the motivation to move or to stop. These findings represent a neuronal correlate of the influence of reward information on motor decision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The motivation to obtain rewards drives how animals act over their environment. To explore the involvement of motor cortices in motivated behaviors, we recorded high-resolution neuronal activity in the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a task that manipulated the motivation to generate/withhold a movement through different cued reward probabilities. Our results show the presence of neuronal signals dynamically reflecting the salience of the cue, in the time immediately following its presentation, and a motivation-related activity in performing (or cancelling) a motor program, while the behavioral response approached. The encoding of multiple reward-related signals in this region leads to consider an important role of premotor areas in the reward circuitry supporting action.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuropeptide Modulation Increases Dendritic Electrical Spread to Restore Neuronal Activity Disrupted by Temperature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peptide neuromodulation has been implicated to shield neuronal activity from acute temperature changes that can otherwise lead to loss of motor control or failure of vital behaviors. However, the cellular actions neuropeptides elicit to support temperature-robust activity remain unknown. Here, we find that peptide neuromodulation restores rhythmic bursting in temperature-compromised central pattern generator (CPG) neurons by counteracting membrane shunt and increasing dendritic electrical spread. We show that acutely rising temperatures reduced spike generation and interrupted ongoing rhythmic motor activity in the crustacean gastric mill CPG. Neuronal release and extrinsic application of <I>Cancer borealis</I> tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), a substance-P-related peptide, restored rhythmic activity. Warming led to a significant decrease in membrane resistance and a shunting of the dendritic signals in the main gastric mill CPG neuron. Using a combination of fluorescent calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we observed that postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated less far within the dendritic neuropil as the system warmed. In the presence of CabTRP Ia, membrane shunt decreased and both postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated farther. At elevated temperatures, CabTRP Ia restored dendritic electrical spread or extended it beyond that at cold temperatures. Selective introduction of the CabTRP Ia conductance using a dynamic clamp demonstrated that the CabTRP Ia voltage-dependent conductance was sufficient to restore rhythmic bursting. Our findings demonstrate that a substance-P-related neuropeptide can boost dendritic electrical spread to maintain neuronal activity when perturbed and reveals key neurophysiological components of neuropeptide actions that support pattern generation in temperature-compromised conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Changes in body temperature can have detrimental consequences for the well-being of an organism. Temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity can be especially dangerous if they affect vital behaviors. Understanding how temperature changes disrupt neuronal activity and identifying how to ameliorate such effects is critically important. Our study of a crustacean circuit shows that warming disrupts rhythmic neuronal activity by increasing membrane shunt and reducing dendritic electrical spread in a key circuit neuron. Through the ionic conductance activated by it, substance-P-related peptide modulation restored electrical spread and counteracted the detrimental temperature effects on rhythmic activity. Because neuropeptides are commonly implicated in sustaining neuronal activity during perturbation, our results provide a promising mechanism to support temperature-robust activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Connectivity and Neuronal Synchrony during Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is uncertainty regarding when and which groups of neurons fire synchronously during seizures. While several studies found heterogeneous firing during seizures, others suggested synchronous neuronal firing in the seizure core. We tested whether neuronal activity during seizures is orderly in the direction of the excitatory neuronal connections in the circuit. There are strong excitatory connections laterally within the septotemporally organized lamella and inhibitory trans-lamellar connections in the hippocampus, which allow testing of the connectivity hypothesis. We further tested whether epileptogenesis enhances synchrony and antiseizure drug administration disrupts it. We recorded local field potentials from CA1 pyramidal neurons using a small microelectrode array and kindled rats by a rapid, recurrent hippocampal stimulation protocol. We compared cross-correlation, theta phase synchronization, entropy, and event synchronization. These analyses revealed that the firing pattern was correlated along the lamellar, but not the septotemporal, axis during evoked seizures. During kindling, neuronal synchrony increased along the lamellar axis, while synchrony along the septotemporal axis remained relatively low. Additionally, the theta phase distribution demonstrated that CA1 pyramidal cell firing became preferential for theta oscillation negative peak as kindling progressed in the lamellar direction but not in the trans-lamellar direction. Last, event synchronization demonstrated that neuronal firings along the lamellar axis were more synchronized than those along the septotemporal axis. There was a marked decrease in synchronization and phase preference after treatment with phenytoin and levetiracetam. The synchrony structure of CA1 pyramidal neurons during seizures and epileptogenesis depends on anatomic connectivity and plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We could improve the efficacy of brain stimulation to treat seizures by understanding the structure of synchrony. Electrical stimulation may disrupt seizures by desynchronizing neurons, but there is an uncertainty on which groups of neurons fire synchronously or chaotically during seizures. Here, we demonstrate that neurons linked by excitatory connections fire synchronously during seizures, and this synchrony is modulated by epileptogenesis and antiseizure drugs. Closed-loop brain stimulation carefully targeted to disrupt synchrony may improve the treatment of seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Establishment of Emotional Memories Is Mediated by Vagal Nerve Activation: Evidence from Noninvasive taVNS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotional memories are better remembered than neutral ones, but the mechanisms leading to this memory bias are not well understood in humans yet. Based on animal research, it is suggested that the memory-enhancing effect of emotion is based on central noradrenergic release, which is triggered by afferent vagal nerve activation. To test the causal link between vagus nerve activation and emotional memory in humans, we applied continuous noninvasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) during exposure to emotional arousing and neutral scenes and tested subsequent, long-term recognition memory after 1 week. We found that taVNS, compared with sham, increased recollection-based memory performance for emotional, but not neutral, material. These findings were complemented by larger recollection-related brain potentials (parietal ERP Old/New effect) during retrieval of emotional scenes encoded under taVNS, compared with sham. Furthermore, brain potentials recorded during encoding also revealed that taVNS facilitated early attentional discrimination between emotional and neutral scenes. Extending animal research, our behavioral and neural findings confirm a modulatory influence of the vagus nerve in emotional memory formation in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emotionally relevant information elicits stronger and more enduring memories than nonrelevant information. Animal research has shown that this memory-enhancing effect of emotion is related to the noradrenergic activation in the brain, which is triggered by afferent fibers of the vagus nerve (VN). In the current study, we show that noninvasive transcutaneous auricular VN stimulation enhances recollection-based memory formation specifically for emotionally relevant information as indicated by behavioral and electrophysiological indices. These human findings give novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment of emotional episodic memories by confirming the causal link between the VN and memory formation which may help understand the neural mechanisms underlying disorders associated with altered memory functions and develop treatment options.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Combining Repetition Suppression and Pattern Analysis Provides New Insights into the Role of M1 and Parietal Areas in Skilled Sequential Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>How does the brain change during learning? In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, both multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and repetition suppression (RS) have been used to detect changes in neuronal representations. In the context of motor sequence learning, the two techniques have provided discrepant findings: pattern analysis showed that only premotor and parietal regions, but not primary motor cortex (M1), develop a representation of trained sequences. In contrast, RS suggested trained sequence representations in all these regions. Here, we applied both analysis techniques to a five-week finger sequence training study, in which participants executed each sequence twice before switching to a different sequence. Both RS and pattern analysis indicated learning-related changes for parietal areas, but only RS showed a difference between trained and untrained sequences in M1. A more fine-grained analysis, however, revealed that the RS effect in M1 reflects a fundamentally different process than in parietal areas. On the first execution, M1 represents especially the first finger of each sequence, likely reflecting preparatory processes. This effect dramatically reduces during the second execution. In contrast, parietal areas represent the identity of a sequence, and this representation stays relatively stable on the second execution. These results suggest that the RS effect does not reflect a trained sequence representation in M1, but rather a preparatory signal for movement initiation. More generally, our study demonstrates that across regions RS can reflect different representational changes in the neuronal population code, emphasizing the importance of combining pattern analysis and RS techniques.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies using pattern analysis have suggested that primary motor cortex (M1) does not represent learnt sequential actions. However, a study using repetition suppression (RS) has reported M1 changes during motor sequence learning. Combining both techniques, we first replicate the discrepancy between them, with learning-related changes in M1 in RS, but not pattern dissimilarities. We further analyzed the representational changes with repetition, and found that the RS effects differ across regions. M1's activity represents the starting finger of the sequence, an effect that vanishes with repetition. In contrast, activity patterns in parietal areas exhibit sequence dependency, which persists with repetition. These results demonstrate the importance of combining RS and pattern analysis to understand the function of brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Stimulus Reliability Automatically Biases Temporal Integration of Discrete Perceptual Targets in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many decisions, from crossing a busy street to choosing a profession, require integration of discrete sensory events. Previous studies have shown that integrative decision-making favors more reliable stimuli, mimicking statistically optimal integration. It remains unclear, however, whether reliability biases operate even when they lead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we asked human observers to reproduce the average motion direction of two suprathreshold coherent motion signals presented successively and with varying levels of reliability, while simultaneously recording whole-brain activity using electroencephalography. By definition, the averaging task should engender equal weighting of the two component motion signals, but instead we found robust behavioral biases in participants' average decisions that favored the more reliable stimulus. Using population-tuning modeling of brain activity we characterized tuning to the average motion direction. In keeping with the behavioral biases, the neural tuning profiles also exhibited reliability biases. A control experiment revealed that observers were able to reproduce motion directions of low and high reliability with equal precision, suggesting that unbiased integration in this task was not only theoretically optimal but demonstrably possible. Our findings reveal that temporal integration of discrete sensory events in the brain is automatically and suboptimally weighted according to stimulus reliability.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many everyday decisions require integration of several sources of information. To safely cross a busy road, for example, one must consider the movement of vehicles with different speeds and trajectories. Previous research has shown that individual stimuli are weighted according to their reliability. Whereas reliability biases typically yield performance that closely mimics statistically optimal integration, it remains unknown whether such biases arise even when they lead to suboptimal performance. Here we combined a novel integrative decision-making task with concurrent brain recording and modeling to address this question. While unbiased decisions were optimal in the task, observers nevertheless exhibited robust reliability biases in both behavior and brain activity, suggesting that reliability-weighted integration is automatic and dissociable from statistically optimal integration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Learning and Representation of Hierarchical Concepts in Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>A key aspect of conceptual knowledge is that it can be flexibly applied at different levels of abstraction, implying a hierarchical organization. It is yet unclear how this hierarchical structure is acquired and represented in the brain. Here we investigate the computations underlying the acquisition and representation of the hierarchical structure of conceptual knowledge in the hippocampal-prefrontal system of 32 human participants (22 females). We assessed the hierarchical nature of learning during a novel tree-like categorization task via computational model comparisons. The winning model allowed to extract and quantify estimates for accumulation and updating of hierarchical compared with single-feature-based concepts from behavior. We find that mPFC tracks accumulation of hierarchical conceptual knowledge over time, and mPFC and hippocampus both support trial-to-trial updating. As a function of those learning parameters, mPFC and hippocampus further show connectivity changes to rostro-lateral PFC, which ultimately represented the hierarchical structure of the concept in the final stages of learning. Our results suggest that mPFC and hippocampus support the integration of accumulated evidence and instantaneous updates into hierarchical concept representations in rostro-lateral PFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A hallmark of human cognition is the flexible use of conceptual knowledge at different levels of abstraction, ranging from a coarse category level to a fine-grained subcategory level. While previous work probed the representational geometry of long-term category knowledge, it is unclear how this hierarchical structure inherent to conceptual knowledge is acquired and represented. By combining a novel hierarchical concept learning task with computational modeling of categorization behavior and concurrent fMRI, we differentiate the roles of key concept learning regions in hippocampus and PFC in learning computations and the representation of a hierarchical category structure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tau and {beta}-Amyloid Burden Predict Actigraphy-Measured and Self-Reported Impairment and Misperception of Human Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease is associated with poor sleep, but the impact of tau and &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) pathology on sleep remains largely unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that tau and A&beta; predict unique impairments in objective and self-perceived human sleep under real-life, free-living conditions. Eighty-nine male and female cognitively healthy older adults received <sup>18</sup>F-FTP-tau and <sup>11</sup>C-PIB-A&beta; PET imaging, 7 nights of sleep actigraphy and questionnaire measures, and neurocognitive assessment. Tau burden, but not A&beta;, was associated with markedly worse objective sleep. In contrast, A&beta; and tau were associated with worse self-reported sleep quality. Of clinical relevance, A&beta; burden predicted a unique perceptual mismatch between objective and subject sleep evaluation, with individuals underestimating their sleep. The magnitude of this mismatch was further predicted by worse executive function. Thus, early-stage tau and A&beta; deposition are linked with distinct phenotypes of real-world sleep impairment, one that includes a cognitive misperception of their own sleep health.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alzheimer's disease is associated with sleep disruption, often before significant memory decline. Thus, real-life patterns of sleep behavior have the potential to serve as a window into early disease progression. In 89 cognitive healthy older adults, we found that tau burden was associated with worse wristwatch actigraphy-measured sleep quality, and that both tau and &beta;-amyloid were independently predictive of self-reported sleep quality. Furthermore, individuals with greater &beta;-amyloid deposition were more likely to underestimate their sleep quality, and sleep quality underestimation was associated with worse executive function. These data support the role of sleep impairment as a key marker of early Alzheimer's disease, and offer the possibility that actigraphy may be an affordable and scalable tool in quantifying Alzheimer's disease-related behavioral changes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detecting industrial motor faults with current signatures [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A major player in industry is the induction motor. The constant motion and mechanical nature of motors causes much wear and tear, creating a need for frequent maintenance such as changing contact brushes. Unmannered and infrequent monitoring of motors, as is common in the industry, can lead to overexertion and cause major faults. If a motor fault is detected earlier through the use of automated fault monitoring, it could prevent minor faults from developing into major faults, reducing the cost and down-time of production due the motor repairs. There are few available methods to detect three-phase motor faults. One method is to analyze average vibration signals values of V, I, pf, P, Q, S, THD and frequency. Others are to analyze instantaneous signal signatures of V and I frequencies, or V and I trajectory plotting a Lissajous curve. These methods need at least three sensors for current and three for voltage for a three-phase motor detection. Methods: Our proposed method of monitoring faults in three-phase industrial motors uses Hilbert Transform (HT) instantaneous current signature curve only, reducing the number of sensors required. Our system detects fault signatures accurately at any voltage or current levels, whether it is delta or star connected motors. This is due to our system design, which incorporates normalized curves of HT in the fault analysis database. We have conducted this experiment in our campus laboratory for two different three-phase motors with four different fault experiments. Results: The results shown in this paper are a comparison of two methods, the V and I Lissajous trajectory curve and our HT instantaneous current signature curve. Conclusion: We have chosen them as our benchmark as their fault results closely resemble our system results, but our system benefits such as universality and a cost reduction in sensors of 50%.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The potential of lunasin extract for the prevention of breast cancer progression by upregulating E-Cadherin and inhibiting ICAM-1 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Research in natural substances for their anticancer potential has become increasingly popular. Lunasin, a soybean protein, is known to inhibit cancer progression via various pathways.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Lunasin Extract (LE) on the expression of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and epithelial cadherins (E-Cadherin) in breast cancer. Methods: In this true-experimental in vivo study, 24 Sprague-Dawley rats that were induced by 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), were used. Based on the therapy given, the groups were divided into, normal, positive control (PC), negative control (NC), adjuvant, curative, and preventive. Lunasin was extracted from soybean seeds of the Grobogan variety in Indonesia. Tissue samples were obtained, processed, stained with anti-ICAM-1 and anti-E-Cadherin antibodies, examined under a microscope, and quantified using H-score. The data were analyzed using ANOVA, which was then followed by Duncan's test. Results: Statistically significant difference in ICAM-1 expression was observed between the following groups: adjuvant and NC, normal and NC, PC and NC, adjuvant and preventive, normal and preventive, PC and preventive, adjuvant and curative, normal and curative, PC and curative. E-Cadherin expression was significantly different between preventive and NC, adjuvant and NC, PC and NC, normal and NC, adjuvant and curative, PC and curative, normal and curative, normal and preventive. Significant negative correlation was found between ICAM-1 and E-Cadherin [-0.616 (-0.8165; -0.283)] with p = 0.001. Conclusion: Preventive dose of LE was able to reduce ICAM-1 expression while increasing E-Cadherin expression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the data access control using blockchain for healthcare domain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An integrated framework for building trustworthy data-driven epidemiological models: Application to the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sheng Zhang, Joan Ponce, Zhen Zhang, Guang Lin, George Karniadakis</p>

Epidemiological models can provide the dynamic evolution of a pandemic but they are based on many assumptions and parameters that have to be adjusted over the time when the pandemic lasts. However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and projection with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to project the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately project the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYC’s government’s website. In addition, we employ the calibrated data-driven model to study the effects of vaccination and timing of reopening indoor dining in NYC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The induction of preterm labor in rhesus macaques is determined by the  strength of immune response to intrauterine infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Monica Cappelletti, Pietro Presicce, Ma Feiyang, Paranthaman Senthamaraikannan, Lisa A. Miller, Matteo Pellegrini, Myung S. Sim, Alan H. Jobe, Senad Divanovic, Sing Sing Way, Claire A. Chougnet, Suhas G. Kallapur</p>

Intrauterine infection/inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor (PTL). However, IUI does not invariably cause PTL. We hypothesized that quantitative and qualitative differences in immune response exist in subjects with or without PTL. To define the triggers for PTL, we developed rhesus macaque models of IUI driven by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or live <i>Escherichia coli</i>. PTL did not occur in LPS challenged rhesus macaques, while <i>E</i>. <i>coli–</i>infected animals frequently delivered preterm. Although LPS and live <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> both caused immune cell infiltration, <i>E</i>. <i>coli–</i>infected animals showed higher levels of inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6) and prostaglandins, in the chorioamnion-decidua and amniotic fluid (AF). Neutrophil infiltration in the chorio-decidua was a common feature to both LPS and <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. However, neutrophilic infiltration and <i>IL6</i> and <i>PTGS2</i> expression in the amnion was specifically induced by live <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of fetal membranes revealed that specific pathways involved in augmentation of inflammation including type I interferon (IFN) response, chemotaxis, sumoylation, and iron homeostasis were up-regulated in the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> group compared to the LPS group. Our data suggest that the intensity of the host immune response to IUI may determine susceptibility to PTL.

                <p>by Daniel Sauter, Frank Kirchhoff</p>

Viruses may not only affect our daily lives but also shape our genome evolution. A recent study shows that the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) drives CpG suppression in a biased manner. Genes involved in the defense against viral invaders are particularly CpG suppressed to avoid self-targeting and to promote an effective immune response.

                Background Digital transformation is changing the structure and landscape of future banking needs with much emphasis on value creation. Autonomous banking solutions must incorporate on-the-fly processing for risky transactions to create this value. In an autonomous environment, access control with role and trust delegation has been said to be highly relevant. The aim of this research is to provide an end to end working solution that will enable autonomous transaction and task processing for banking. Method We illustrate the use case for task delegation with the aid of risk graphs, risk bands and finite state machines. This paper also highlights a step by step task delegation process using a risk ordering relation methodology that can be embedded into smart contracts. Results Task delegation with risk ordering relation is illustrated with six process owners that share immutable ledgers. Task delegation properties using Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is used to eliminate barriers for autonomous transaction processing. Secondly, the application of risk graph and risk ordering relation with reference to delegation of tasks is a novel approach that is nonexistent in RBAC. Conclusion The novelty of this study is the logic for task delegation and task policies for autonomous execution on autonomous banking platforms akin to the idea of federated ID (Liberty Alliance).

                Background: One way to reduce the length of the gain medium in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) is by doping the fiber core with a high concentration of Erbium. However, this method caused ion clustering effects, which limits the EDFA’s efficiency.  In this research, the use of Gallium as a new co-dopant in erbium-doped silica fiber is explored. Methods: The new fiber, namely Gallium co-doped Erbium fiber (Ga-EDF), is used as a gain medium in an optical fiber amplifier setup. A 2-meter length of the Ga-EDF fiber was used in a single pass configuration with a forward pumping scheme at 150 mW pump power. The Ga-EDF amplifier's gain and noise figure while pumping at 980 nm and 1480 nm were compared. The amplifier's performance was evaluated as the input signal power varied between -30 dBm to 3 dBm, over the wavelength range of 1520 nm to 1580 nm. Results: The 980 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier achieved the maximum small-signal gain of 22.45 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.71 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1535 nm. Meanwhile, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF amplifier attained the maximum small-signal gain of 20.83 dB and the corresponding noise figure of 5.09 dB at the input signal wavelength of 1550 nm. At the input signal power below -20 dBm and the wavelength range 1520 nm to 1547 nm, the Ga-EDF performs better when pumped at 980 nm. Their performance is comparable at the input signal wavelength range between 1547 nm to 1580 nm. At the input signal power above -20 dBm, the 1480 nm-pumped Ga-EDF outperformed the 980 nm-pumped amplifier. Conclusions: The overall performance indicates that the gain saturation point of the 1480 nm-pumped amplifier is higher than the 980 nm-pumped.

                Nason et al. present a real-time brain-machine interface for controlling the simultaneous and independent movements of two groups of fingers in nonhuman primates. These techniques can be used to restore naturalistic control of paralyzed hands and enable a deeper understanding of how motor cortex represents dexterous finger behaviors.

                Astrocytes regulate the formation and function of neuronal synapses via multiple signals, however, what controls regional and temporal expression of these signals during development is unknown. We determined the expression profile of astrocyte synapse-regulating genes in the developing mouse visual cortex, identifying astrocyte signals that show differential temporal and layer-enriched expression. These patterns are not intrinsic to astrocytes, but regulated by visually-evoked neuronal activity, as they are absent in mice lacking glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals. Consequently, synapses remain immature. Expression of synapse-regulating genes and synaptic development are also altered when astrocyte signaling is blunted by diminishing calcium release from astrocyte stores. Single nucleus RNA sequencing identified groups of astrocytic genes regulated by neuronal and astrocyte activity, and a cassette of genes that show layer-specific enrichment. Thus, the development of cortical circuits requires coordinated signaling between astrocytes and neurons, highlighting astrocytes as a target to manipulate in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Signaling pathways in biological systems rely on specific interactions between multiple biomolecules. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy provides a powerful toolbox to quantify such interactions directly in living cells. Cross-correlation analysis of spectrally separated fluctuations provides information about inter-molecular interactions but is usually limited to two fluorophore species. Here, we present scanning fluorescence spectral correlation spectroscopy (SFSCS), a versatile approach that can be implemented on commercial confocal microscopes, allowing the investigation of interactions between multiple protein species at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that SFSCS enables cross-talk-free cross-correlation, diffusion and oligomerization analysis of up to four protein species labeled with strongly overlapping fluorophores. As an example, we investigate the interactions of influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 with two cellular host factors simultaneously. We furthermore apply raster spectral image correlation spectroscopy for the simultaneous analysis of up to four species and determine the stoichiometry of ternary IAV polymerase complexes in the cell nucleus.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The interplay of RNA:DNA hybrid structure and G-quadruplexes determines the outcome of R-loop-replisome collisions</a></h4>

              
                R-loops are a major source of genome instability associated with transcription-induced replication stress. However, how R-loops inherently impact replication fork progression is not understood. Here, we characterize R-loop-replisome collisions using a fully reconstituted eukaryotic DNA replication system. We find that RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes at both co-directional and head-on R-loops can impact fork progression by inducing fork stalling, uncoupling of leading strand synthesis from replisome progression, and nascent strand gaps. RNase H1 and Pif1 suppress replication defects by resolving RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes, respectively. We also identify an intrinsic capacity of replisomes to maintain fork progression at certain R-loops by unwinding RNA:DNA hybrids, repriming leading strand synthesis downstream of G-quadruplexes, or utilizing R-loop transcripts to prime leading strand restart during co-directional R-loop-replisome collisions. Collectively, the data demonstrates that the outcome of R-loop-replisome collisions is modulated by R-loop structure, providing a mechanistic basis for the distinction of deleterious from non-deleterious R-loops.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex specific pubertal and metabolic regulation of Kiss1 neurons via Nhlh2</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons control gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release through the secretion of kisspeptin. Kiss1 neurons serve as a nodal center that conveys essential regulatory cues for the attainment and maintenance of reproductive function. Despite this critical role, the mechanisms that control kisspeptin synthesis and release remain largely unknown. Using Drop-Seq data from the arcuate nucleus of adult mice and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, we identified Nescient Helix-Loop-Helix 2 (<i>Nhlh2),</i> a transcription factor (TF) of the basic helix-loop-helix family, to be enriched in Kiss1 neurons. JASPAR analysis revealed several binding sites for NHLH2 in the <i>Kiss1</i> and <i>Tac2</i> (neurokinin B) 5' regulatory regions. <i>In vitro</i> luciferase assays evidenced a robust stimulatory action of NHLH2 on human <i>KISS1</i> and <i>TAC3</i> promoters. The recruitment of NHLH2 to the <i>KISS1</i> and <i>TAC3</i> promoters was further confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation. <i>In vivo</i> conditional ablation of <i>Nhlh2</i> from Kiss1 neurons using <i>Kiss1</i><sup>Cre</sup>:<i>Nhlh2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice induced a male-specific delay in puberty onset, in line with a decrease in arcuate <i>Kiss1</i> expression. Females retained normal reproductive function albeit with irregular estrous cycles. Further analysis of male <i>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>:Nhlh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice revealed higher susceptibility to metabolic challenges in the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and impaired response to leptin. Overall, in Kiss1 neurons, Nhlh2 contributes to the metabolic regulation of kisspeptin and NKB synthesis and release, with implications for the timing of puberty onset and regulation of fertility in male mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off-target expression of Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses in wild type C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although non-amplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the hippocampus and cortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent non-amplified off-target DIO expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed extensive Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or cFos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry+ cells of C57BL/6J mice. Taken together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have considerable off-target expression in wild type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conformational Change of Syntaxin-3b in Regulating SNARE Complex Assembly in the Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release of synaptic vesicles relies on the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, consisting of syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane and synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle. The formation of the SNARE complex progressively zippers towards the membranes, which drives membrane fusion between the plasma membrane and the synaptic vesicle. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of SNARE complex regulation is unclear. In this study, we investigate the syntaxin-3b isoform found in the retinal ribbon synapses using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to monitor the conformational changes of syntaxin-3b that modulate the SNARE complex formation. We found that syntaxin-3b is predominantly in a self-inhibiting closed conformation, inefficiently forming the ternary SNARE complex. Conversely, a phosphomimetic mutation (T14E) at the N-terminal region of syntaxin-3b promoted the open conformation, similar to the constitutively open form of syntaxin LE mutant. When syntaxin-3b is bound to Munc18-1, SNARE complex formation is almost completely blocked. Surprisingly, the T14E mutation of syntaxin-3b partially abolishes Munc18-1 regulation, acting as a conformational switch to trigger SNARE complex assembly. Thus, we suggest a model where the conformational change of syntaxin-3b induced by phosphorylation initiates the release of neurotransmitters in the ribbon synapses.

                A significant component of the repetitive dynamics during locomotion in vertebrates is generated within the spinal cord. The legged locomotion of mammals is most likely controled by a hierarchical, multi-layer spinal network structure, while the axial circuitry generating the undulatory swimming motion of animals like lamprey is thought to have only a single layer in each segment. Recent experiments have suggested a hybrid network structure in zebrafish larvae in which two types of excitatory interneurons (V2a-I and V2a-II) both make first-order connections to the brain and last-order connections to the motor pool. These neurons are connected by electrical and chemical synapses across segments. Through computational modeling and an asymptotic perturbation approach we show that this interleaved interaction between the two neuron populations allows the spinal network to quickly establish the correct activation sequence of the segments when starting from random initial conditions and to reduce the dependence of the intersegmental phase difference (ISPD) of the oscillations on the swimming frequency. The latter reduces the frequency dependence of the waveform of the swimming motion. In the model the reduced frequency dependence is largely due to the different impact of chemical and electrical synapses on the ISPD and to the significant spike-frequency adaptation that has been observed experimentally in V2a-II neurons, but not in V2a-I neurons. Our model makes experimentally testable predictions and points to a benefit of the hybrid structure for undulatory locomotion that may not be relevant for legged locomotion.

                The cognitive stimulation induced by multilingualism may slow down age-related memory impairment. However, a suitable neuroscientific framework to assess the influence of multilingualism on age-related memory processes is missing. We propose an experimental paradigm that assesses semantic memory processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To this end, we modified the picture-word interference (PWI) task to be suitable for multilingual subjects undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In particular, stimulus material was prepared in multiple languages and closely matched in semantic properties, thus enabling participants to perform the experiment in a language of their choice. This paradigm was validated in a group (n = 62) of healthy elderly ([&ge;]64 years) multilingual subjects, all practicing three or more languages. Consistent with the engagement of semantic memory processes, we found that the encoding and recognition of semantically related vs. unrelated picture-word pairs evoked robust differences in behavior and the neural activity of parietal-temporal networks. These effects were not modulated by the language in which the task was performed. Based on this validation in a multilingual population, we conclude that the proposed paradigm will allow future studies to evaluate whether multilingualism aptitude engages neural systems in a manner that protects long-term memory from aging-related decline.

                Disgust represents a multifaceted defensive-avoidance response. On the behavioral level, the response includes withdrawal and a disgust-specific facial expression. While both serve the avoidance of pathogens the latter additionally transmits social-communicative information. Given that common and distinct brain representation of the primary defensive-avoidance response (core disgust) and encoding of the social-communicative signal (social disgust) remain debated we employed neuroimaging meta-analyses to (1) determine brain systems generally engaged in disgust processing, and (2) segregate common and distinct brain systems for core and social disgust. Disgust processing, in general, engaged a bilateral network encompassing the insula, amygdala, occipital and prefrontal regions. Core disgust evoked stronger reactivity in left-lateralized threat detection and defensive response network including amygdala, occipital and frontal regions while social disgust engaged a right-lateralized superior temporal-frontal network engaged in social cognition. Anterior insula, inferior frontal and fusiform regions were commonly engaged during core and social disgust suggesting a common neural basis. We demonstrate a common and separable neural basis of primary disgust responses and encoding of associated social-communicative signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping electromagnetic networks to haemodynamic networks in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain neural communication is typically estimated from statistical associations among electromagnetic or haemodynamic time-series. The relationship between functional network architectures recovered from these two types of neural activity remains unknown. Here we map electromagnetic networks (measured using magnetoencephalography; MEG) to haemodynamic networks (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI). We find that the relationship between the two modalities is regionally heterogeneous and systematically follows the cortical hierarchy, with close correspondence in unimodal cortex and poor correspondence in transmodal cortex, potentially reflecting patterns of laminar differentiation, recurrent subcortical input and neurovascular coupling. Correspondence between the two is largely driven by slower rhythms, particularly the delta (2-4 Hz) and beta (15-29 Hz) frequency band. Moreover, haemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electromagnetic activity in a single frequency band, but rather arises from the mixing of multiple neurophysiological rhythms. Collectively, these findings demonstrate highly organized but only partly overlapping patterns of connectivity in MEG and fMRI functional networks, opening fundamentally new avenues for studying the relationship between cortical micro-architecture and multi-modal connectivity patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective activation of BK channels in small-headed dendritic spines suppresses excitatory postsynaptic potentials</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are the main receptacles of excitatory information in the brain. Their particular morphology, with a small head connected to the dendrite by a slender neck, has inspired theoretical and experimental work to understand how these structural features affect the processing, storage and integration of synaptic inputs in pyramidal neurons (PNs). The activation of glutamate receptors in spines triggers a large voltage change as well as calcium signals at the spine head. Thus, voltage-gated and calcium-activated potassium channels located in the spine head likely play a key role in synaptic transmission. Here we study the presence and function of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels in spines from layer 5 PNs. We find that BK channels are localized to dendrites and spines regardless of their size, but their activity can only be detected in spines with small head volumes (less than or equal to 0.09 micrometer^3), which reduces the amplitude of two-photon (2P) uncaging (u) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded at the soma. In addition, we find that calcium signals in spines with small head volumes are significantly larger than those observed in spines with larger head volumes. In accordance with our experimental data, numerical simulations predict that synaptic inputs impinging onto spines with small head volumes generate voltage responses and calcium signals within the spine head itself that are significantly larger than those observed in spines with bigger head volumes, which are sufficient to activate spine BK channels. These results show that BK channels are selectively activated in small-headed spines, suggesting a new level of dendritic spine-mediated regulation of synaptic processing, integration, and plasticity in cortical PNs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A generalized cortical activity pattern at internally-generated mental context boundaries during unguided narrative recall</a></h4>

              
                Current theory and empirical studies suggest that humans segment continuous experiences into events based on the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs; detection of these "event boundaries" evokes transient neural responses. However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such "internal boundaries" share neural response properties with externally-driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns were negatively correlated with patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.
