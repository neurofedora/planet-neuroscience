	<p>Fibromyalgia is related to central sensitization syndrome (CSS) and is associated with chronic pain and a decrease in general health. The aim of this study was to explore how changes in brain patterns of female fibromyalgia patients are shaped by neurofeedback therapy and how it affects pain perception and general health. A quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-tests was carried out with 37 female fibromyalgia patients referred by the Pain Unit of the National Health Service of Spain. The method involved applying a sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) protocol to monitor changes in brain waves under different conditions, taking pre-/post-test measurements of perceived pain, general health and the impact on fibromyalgia. Measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and EEG (SMR, theta waves). During therapy, the SMR/theta wave ratio increased significantly and after application of therapy, significant results were observed for the FIQR, VAS and GHQ-28. In conclusion, neurofeedback therapy increases the SMR/theta wave ratio in fibromyalgia, helping to maintain a balance between brain functions. This is associated with the activation of inhibitory processes, which is related to the perceived improvement of pain in fibromyalgia patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">7T MRI Differetiates Remyelinated from Demyelinated Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To noninvasively assess myelin status in chronic white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), we developed and evaluated a simple classification scheme based on T1 relaxation time maps derived from 7-tesla postmortem and in vivo MRI.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the MP2RAGE MRI sequence, we classified 36 lesions from 4 postmortem MS brains as “long-T1,” “short-T1,” and “mixed-T1” by visual comparison to neocortex. Within these groups, we compared T1 times to histologically derived measures of myelin and axons. We performed similar analysis of 235 chronic lesions with known date of onset in 25 MS cases in vivo and in a validation cohort of 222 lesions from 66 MS cases, investigating associations with clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem, lesions classified qualitatively as long-T1, short-T1, and mixed-T1 corresponded to fully demyelinated, fully remyelinated, and mixed demyelinated/remyelinated lesions, respectively (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Demyelination (rather than axon loss) dominantly contributed to initial T1 prolongation. We observed lesions with similar characteristics in vivo, allowing manual classification with substantial interrater and excellent intrarater reliability. Short-T1 lesions were most common in the deep white matter, whereas long-T1 and mixed-T1 lesions were prevalent in the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter (p = 0.02) and were much more likely to have paramagnetic rims suggesting chronic inflammation (p &lt; 0.001). Older age at the time of lesion formation portended less remyelination (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>7-tesla T1 mapping with MP2RAGE, a clinically available MRI method, allows qualitative and quantitative classification of chronic MS lesions according to myelin content, rendering straightforward the tracking of lesional myelination changes over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FLARIM v2.0, an improved method to quantify transcript-ribosome interactions in vivo in the adult Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Neural injury triggers striking immune reactions from glial cells, including significant transcriptional and morphological changes, but it is unclear how these events are coordinated to mount an effective immune response. Here, we present a new variant of the Fluorescence assay to detect ribosome interactions with mRNA (FLARIM), which we term FLARIM v2.0, to visualize single immune gene transcripts and association with ribosomes in glia responding to neurodegeneration. Specifically, using an in vivo axotomy assay in Drosophila, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Mmp-1) mRNAs and associated ribosomes are detected in distal processes of reactive glia where they are actively engulfing degenerating axonal material, suggesting that local translation is an important component of the glial immune response to axotomy. This work also validates our enhanced FLARIM assay as a promising tool to investigate mechanisms of mRNA transport and translation in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical hyperexcitability drives dying forward ALS symptoms and pathology in mice</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal disorder caused by degeneration of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord. The origin of ALS in the central nervous system is unclear, however cortical hyperexcitability appears as an early and intrinsic feature of ALS and has been linked to degeneration of spinal motor neurons via a dying-forward mechanism. Here, we implement chemogenetics to validate the dying forward hypothesis of ALS in mice. We show that chronic hyperexcitability of corticomotoneurons induced by excitatory chemogenetics results in motor symptoms and core neuropathological hallmarks of ALS, including corticomotoneuron loss, corticospinal tract degeneration and reactive gliosis. Importantly, corticomotoneuron loss was sufficient to drive degeneration of spinal motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), associated with cytoplasmic TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. These findings establish a cortical origin of ALS mediated by neuronal hyperexcitability, consistent with a dying forward mechanism of neurodegeneration.

                Gli1 expressing neural stem cells, in the subventricular zone of the adult mammalian brain, respond to demyelination injury by differentiating into oligodendrocytes. We have identified Gpnmb as a novel regulator of oligodendrogenesis in Gli1 neural stem cells, whose expression is induced by TGF{beta}1 signaling via Gli1, in response to a demyelinating injury. Upregulation of Gpnmb further activates the TGF{beta}1 pathway by increasing the expression of the TGF{beta}1 binding receptor subunit, TGF{beta}R2. Thus the TGF{beta}1[-&gt;]Gli1[-&gt;]Gpnmb[-&gt;]TGF{beta}R2 signaling pathway forms a feed forward loop for sustained activation of TGF{beta}1 signaling in Gli1 neural stem cells, resulting in inhibition of their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes following demyelination.

	<p>Along with deficits in spatial cognition, a decline in body-related information is observed in aging and is thought to contribute to impairments in navigation, memory, and space perception. According to the embodied cognition theories, bodily and environmental information play a crucial role in defining cognitive representations. Thanks to the possibility to involve body-related information, manipulate environmental stimuli, and add multisensory cues, virtual reality is one of the best candidates for spatial memory rehabilitation in aging for its embodied potential. However, current virtual neurorehabilitation solutions for aging and neurodegenerative diseases are in their infancy. Here, we discuss three concepts that could be used to improve embodied representations of the space with virtual reality. The virtual bodily representation is the combination of idiothetic information involved during virtual navigation thanks to input/output devices; the spatial affordances are environmental or symbolic elements used by the individual to act in the virtual environment; finally, the virtual enactment effect is the enhancement on spatial memory provided by actively (cognitively and/or bodily) interacting with the virtual space and its elements. Theoretical and empirical findings will be presented to propose innovative rehabilitative solutions in aging for spatial memory and navigation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Sustained axonal degeneration may play a critical role in prolonged disorder of consciousness (DOCs) pathophysiology. We evaluated levels of neurofilament light chain (NFL), an axonal injury marker, in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and in the minimally conscious state (MCS) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). (2) Methods: This prospective multicenter blinded study involved 70 patients with prolonged DOC and 70 sex-/age-matched healthy controls. Serum NFL levels were evaluated at 1–3 and 6 months post-injury and compared with those of controls. NFL levels were compared by DOC severity (UWS vs. MCS) and etiology (TBI vs. HIBI). (3) Results: Patients’ serum NFL levels were significantly higher than those of controls at 1–3 and 6 months post-injury (medians, 1729 and 426 vs. 90 pg/mL; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). NFL levels were higher in patients with UWS than in those in MCS at 1–3 months post-injury (p = 0.008) and in patients with HIBI than in those with TBI at 6 months post-injury (p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: Patients with prolonged DOC present sustained axonal degeneration that is affected differently over time by brain injury severity and etiology.</p>

                <p>Fire plays a dominant role in deforestation, particularly in the tropics, but the relative extent of transformations and influence of fire frequency on eventual forest loss remain unclear. Here, we analyze the frequency of fire and its influence on postfire forest trajectories between 2001 and 2018. We account for ~1.1% of Latin American forests burnt in 2002&ndash;2003 (8,465,850 ha). Although 40.1% of forests (3,393,250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, ~48% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally. As climate change transforms fire regimes across the region, key actions are needed to conserve Latin American forests.</p>

                <p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) results from the capacity of several human cancers to metastasize to the pleural cavity. No effective treatments are currently available, reflecting our insufficient understanding of the basic mechanisms leading to MPE progression. Here, we found that efferocytosis through the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and MERTK led to the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by four distinct pleural cavity macrophage (M) subpopulations characterized by different metabolic states and cell chemotaxis properties. In turn, IL-10 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) inducing the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Genetic ablation of <I>Axl</I> and <I>Mertk</I> in Ms or IL-10 receptor in DCs or <I>Timp1</I> substantially reduced MPE progression. Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade&mdash;from the clearance of apoptotic cells by Ms, to production of IL-10, to induction of TIMP1 in DCs&mdash;that facilitates MPE progression. This inflammatory cascade offers a series of therapeutic targets for MPE.</p>

                <p>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (<I>N</I> = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.</p>

                <p>Oxalate-rich mineral accretions, often found in rock shelters around the world, offer important opportunities for radiocarbon dating of associated rock art. Here, sample characterization and chemical pretreatment techniques are used to characterize the accretions, prescreen for evidence of open-system behavior, and address potential contamination. The results provide stratigraphically consistent sequences of radiocarbon dates in millimeter-scale laminated accretions, demonstrating their reliability for dating rock art, particularly symbolic markings commonly engraved into these relatively soft deposits. The age sequences are also consistent with correlations between distinctive patterns in the layer sequences visible in shelters up to 90 km apart in the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia, suggesting their synchronized formation is not entirely shelter specific but broadly controlled by variations in regional environmental conditions. Consequently, these accretions also offer potential as paleoenvironmental archives, with radiocarbon dating of layers in nine accretions indicating four, approximately synchronous growth intervals covering the past 43 ka.</p>

                <p>Beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) ameliorate environmental stress, but whether they can prevent mortality and the underlying host response mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral <I>Mussismilia hispida</I> exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed "post-heat stress disorder" was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae. This study provides insights into the responses that underlie probiotic host manipulation. We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.</p>

Advancing from current few-qubit devices to silicon quantum processors with upward of a million qubits, as required for fault-tolerant operation, presents several unique challenges, one of the most demanding being the ability to deliver microwave signals for large-scale qubit control. Here, we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nanoelectronic circuit. Critically, this technique uses only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously. We show that the global field can be used to perform spin resonance of single electrons confined in a silicon double quantum dot device, establishing the feasibility of this approach for scalable spin qubit control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nanodissected elastically loaded clathrin lattices relax to increased curvature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major endocytosis pathway for the specific internalization of large compounds, growth factors, and receptors. Formation of internalized vesicles from the flat plasma membrane is accompanied by maturation of cytoplasmic clathrin coats. How clathrin coats mature and the mechanistic role of clathrin coats are still largely unknown. Maturation models proposed clathrin coats to mature at constant radius or constant area, driven by molecular actions or elastic energy. Here, combining high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) imaging, HS-AFM nanodissection, and elasticity theory, we show that clathrin lattices deviating from the intrinsic curvature of clathrin form elastically loaded assemblies. Upon nanodissection of the clathrin network, the stored elastic energy in these lattices drives lattice relaxation to accommodate an ideal area-curvature ratio toward the formation of closed clathrin-coated vesicles. Our work supports that the release of elastic energy stored in curvature-frustrated clathrin lattices could play a major role in CME.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A two-step strategy for delivering particles to targets hidden within microfabricated porous media</a></h4>

              
                <p>The delivery of small particles into porous environments remains highly challenging because of the low permeability to the fluids that carry these colloids. Even more challenging is that the specific location of targets in the porous environment usually is not known and cannot be determined from the outside. Here, we demonstrate a two-step strategy to deliver suspended colloids to targets that are "hidden" within closed porous media. The first step serves to automatically convert any hidden targets into soluto-inertial "beacons," capable of sustaining long-lived solute outfluxes. The second step introduces the deliverable objects, which are designed to autonomously migrate against the solute fluxes emitted by the targets, thereby following chemical trails that lead to the target. Experimental and theoretical demonstrations of the strategy lay out the design elements required for the solute and the deliverable objects, suggesting routes to delivering colloidal objects to hidden targets in various environments and technologies.</p>

                <p>In recent years, lanthanum aluminate/strontium titanate (LAO/STO) heterointerfaces have been used to create a growing family of nanoelectronic devices based on nanoscale control of LAO/STO metal-to-insulator transition. The properties of these devices are wide-ranging, but they are restricted by nature of the underlying thick STO substrate. Here, single-crystal freestanding membranes based on LAO/STO heterostructures were fabricated, which can be directly integrated with other materials via van der Waals stacking. The key properties of LAO/STO are preserved when LAO/STO membranes are formed. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography is shown to successfully create reversible patterns of nanoscale conducting regions, which survive to millikelvin temperatures. The ability to form reconfigurable conducting nanostructures on LAO/STO membranes opens opportunities to integrate a variety of nanoelectronics with silicon-based architectures and flexible, magnetic, or superconducting materials.</p>

                <p>The centrality of the Krebs cycle in metabolism has long been interpreted as evidence of its antiquity, and consequently, questions regarding its provenance, and whether it initially functioned as a cycle or not, have received much attention. The present report shows that prebiotic oxidation of &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be achieved by UV photolysis of a simple geochemical species (HS<sup>&ndash;</sup>), which leads to &alpha;-oxo carboxylates that feature in the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt. Further reaction of these products leads to almost all intermediates of the Krebs cycle proper, succinate semialdehyde bypass, and glyoxylate shunt. Fumarate, the missing Krebs cycle component, and the required &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be provided by a highly related hydrogen cyanide chemistry, which also provides precursors for amino acids, nucleotides, and phospholipids.</p>

                <p>While energy-structure-function (ESF) maps are a powerful new tool for in silico materials design, the cost of acquiring an ESF map for many properties is too high for routine integration into high-throughput virtual screening workflows. Here, we propose the next evolution of the ESF map. This uses parallel Bayesian optimization to selectively acquire energy and property data, generating the same levels of insight at a fraction of the computational cost. We use this approach to obtain a two orders of magnitude speedup on an ESF study that focused on the discovery of molecular crystals for methane capture, saving more than 500,000 central processing unit hours from the original protocol. By accelerating the acquisition of insight from ESF maps, we pave the way for the use of these maps in automated ultrahigh-throughput screening pipelines by greatly reducing the opportunity risk associated with the choice of system to calculate.</p>

                <p>The recruitment of Unc-51-like kinase and TANK-binding kinase 1 complexes is essential for Nuclear dot protein 52-mediated selective autophagy and relies on the specific association of NDP52, RB1-inducible coiled-coil protein 1, and Nak-associated protein 1 (5-azacytidine-induced protein 2, AZI2). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we find that except for the NDP52 SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH)/RB1CC1 coiled-coil interaction, the LC3-interacting region of NDP52 can directly interact with the RB1CC1 Claw domain, as that of NAP1 FIP200-binding region (FIR). The determined crystal structures of NDP52 SKICH/RB1CC1 complex, NAP1 FIR/RB1CC1 complex, and the related NAP1 FIR/Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein complex not only elucidate the molecular bases underpinning the interactions of RB1CC1 with NDP52 and NAP1 but also reveal that RB1CC1 Claw and Autophagy-related protein 8 family proteins are competitive in binding to NAP1 and NDP52. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of NDP52, NAP1 with RB1CC1 and ATG8 family proteins.</p>

                <p>The year 2020 brought unimaginable challenges in public health, with the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires across the western United States. Wildfires produce high levels of fine particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>). Recent studies reported that short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We acquired and linked publicly available daily data on PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and other confounders for 92 western U.S. counties that were affected by the 2020 wildfires. We estimated the association between short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> during the wildfires and the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We adjusted for several time-varying confounding factors (e.g., weather, seasonality, long-term trends, mobility, and population size). We found strong evidence that wildfires amplified the effect of short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> on COVID-19 cases and deaths, although with substantial heterogeneity across counties.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Developmental nicotine exposure (DNE), alters brainstem neurons that control breathing, including hypoglossal motor neurons (XIIMNs), which innervate the tongue. Here, we tested the hypothesis that chronic, episodic DNE (eDNE), which mimics nicotine replacement therapies such as e-cigarettes or nicotine gum, alters the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), XIIMN intrinsic properties, and tongue muscle function <I>in vivo</I> similar to what we have observed with a chronic, sustained exposure model. We delivered nicotine to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats through drinking water and studied pups of either sex in two age groups: postnatal day (P)1&ndash;P5 and P10&ndash;P12, which encompasses a critical period in brain development. At P1&ndash;P5, eDNE was associated with delayed recovery of nAChRs from desensitization; however, there were no changes in the magnitude of desensitization, XIIMN intrinsic properties, or tongue muscle function <I>in vivo.</I> By P10&ndash;P12, eDNE XIIMNs had lower peak firing frequencies in response to depolarizing current injection, larger delayed rectifier potassium currents, and continued to exhibit delayed nAChR recovery. Moreover, this age group exhibited a blunted and delayed tongue muscle response to nasal occlusion <I>in vivo</I>, indicating that changes to XIIMN intrinsic properties is an important mechanism behind this effect, as it is not produced by altered nAChR function alone. Together, these results show that eDNE alters XIIMNs and tongue muscle function during a critical period in brain development and that the specific effects of chronic nicotine exposure may be pattern dependent.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autosomal recessive human thymidine kinase 2 (<i>TK2</i>) mutations cause TK2 deficiency, which typically manifests as a progressive and fatal mitochondrial myopathy in infants and children. Treatment with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides deoxycytidine and thymidine ameliorates mitochondrial defects and extends the lifespan of <i>Tk2</i> knock-in mouse (Tk2<sup>KI</sup>) and compassionate use deoxynucleoside therapy in TK2 deficient patients have shown promising indications of efficacy. To augment therapy for Tk2 deficiency, we assessed gene therapy alone and in combination with deoxynucleoside therapy in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated pAAVsc CB6 PI vectors containing human TK2 cDNA (<i>TK2</i>). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-<i>TK2</i> was administered to Tk2<sup>KI</sup>, which were serially assessed for weight, motor functions, and survival as well as biochemical functions in tissues. AAV-<i>TK2</i> treated mice were further treated with deoxynucleosides.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AAV9 delivery of human TK2 cDNA to Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice efficiently rescued Tk2 activity in all the tissues tested except the kidneys, delayed disease onset, and increased lifespan. Sequential treatment of Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice with AAV9 first followed by AAV2 at different ages allowed us to reduce the viral dose while further prolonging the lifespan. Furthermore, addition of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine supplementation to AAV9 + AAV2 treated Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice dramatically improved mtDNA copy numbers in the liver and kidneys, animal growth, and lifespan.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicate that AAV-<i>TK2</i> gene therapy as well as combination deoxynucleoside and gene therapies is more effective in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice than pharmacological alone. Thus, combination of gene therapy with substrate enhancement is a promising therapeutic approach for TK2 deficiency and potentially other metabolic disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <p>The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved. We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <p>by Kshitij Dwivedi, Michael F. Bonner, Radoslaw Martin Cichy, Gemma Roig</p>

The human visual cortex enables visual perception through a cascade of hierarchical computations in cortical regions with distinct functionalities. Here, we introduce an AI-driven approach to discover the functional mapping of the visual cortex. We related human brain responses to scene images measured with functional MRI (fMRI) systematically to a diverse set of deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform different scene perception tasks. We found a structured mapping between DNN tasks and brain regions along the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Low-level visual tasks mapped onto early brain regions, 3-dimensional scene perception tasks mapped onto the dorsal stream, and semantic tasks mapped onto the ventral stream. This mapping was of high fidelity, with more than 60% of the explainable variance in nine key regions being explained. Together, our results provide a novel functional mapping of the human visual cortex and demonstrate the power of the computational approach.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Glycerol suppresses glucose consumption in trypanosomes through metabolic contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Allmann, Marion Wargnies, Nicolas Plazolles, Edern Cahoreau, Marc Biran, Pauline Morand, Erika Pineda, Hanna Kulyk, Corinne Asencio, Oriana Villafraz, Loïc Rivière, Emmanuel Tetaud, Brice Rotureau, Arnaud Mourier, Jean-Charles Portais, Frédéric Bringaud</p>

Microorganisms must make the right choice for nutrient consumption to adapt to their changing environment. As a consequence, bacteria and yeasts have developed regulatory mechanisms involving nutrient sensing and signaling, known as “catabolite repression,” allowing redirection of cell metabolism to maximize the consumption of an energy-efficient carbon source. Here, we report a new mechanism named “metabolic contest” for regulating the use of carbon sources without nutrient sensing and signaling. <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> is a unicellular eukaryote transmitted by tsetse flies and causing human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. We showed that, in contrast to most microorganisms, the insect stages of this parasite developed a preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose consumption beginning after the depletion of glycerol present in the medium. This “metabolic contest” depends on the combination of 3 conditions: (i) the sequestration of both metabolic pathways in the same subcellular compartment, here in the peroxisomal-related organelles named glycosomes; (ii) the competition for the same substrate, here ATP, with the first enzymatic step of the glycerol and glucose metabolic pathways both being ATP-dependent (glycerol kinase and hexokinase, respectively); and (iii) an unbalanced activity between the competing enzymes, here the glycerol kinase activity being approximately 80-fold higher than the hexokinase activity. As predicted by our model, an approximately 50-fold down-regulation of the GK expression abolished the preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose and glycerol being metabolized concomitantly. In theory, a metabolic contest could be found in any organism provided that the 3 conditions listed above are met.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods and guidance on conducting, reporting, publishing and appraising living systematic reviews: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The living systematic review (LSR) approach is based on an ongoing surveillance of the literature and continual updating. A few guidance documents address the conduct, reporting, publishing and appraisal of systematic reviews (SRs), but the methodology described is either not up-to date or not suitable for LSRs and misses additional LSR-specific considerations. The objective of this scoping review is to systematically collate methodological literature and guidance on how to conduct, report, publish and appraise the quality of LSRs. The scoping review will allow the mapping of the existing evidence on the topic to support LSRs authors seeking guidance and identify related gaps.  Methods: To achieve our objectives, we will conduct a scoping review to survey and evaluate existing evidence, using the standard scoping review methodology. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane using the OVID interface. The search strategy was developed by a researcher experienced in developing literature search strategies with the help of an information specialist. As for searching grey literature, we will seek existing guidelines and handbooks on LSRs from organizations that conduct evidence syntheses using the Lens.org website. Two review authors will extract and catalogue the study data on LSR methodological aspects into a standardized and pilot-tested data extraction form. The main categories will reflect proposed methods for (i) conducting LSRs, (ii) reporting of LSRs, (iii) publishing and (iv) appraising the quality of LSRs. Data synthesis and conclusion: By collecting these data from methodological surveys and papers, as well as existing guidance documents and handbooks on LSRs, we might identify specific issues and components lacking within current LSR methodology. Thus, the systematically obtained findings of the scoping review could be used as basis for the revision of existing methods tools on LSR, for instance a PRISMA statement extension for LSRs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Exploring the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies: a qualitative study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Japan is the world's largest country in terms of the number of long-lived companies, the majority of which are family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises. On the other hand, many business owners will be retiring without successors, and the closure of these small and medium enterprises may have a significant impact on the future economy. The purpose of this study is to explore the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies so that potential successors can know what they will experience as managers and be prepared for the future, and professionals who support successors can be provided with information on the growth process of successors to provide appropriate support. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six successors of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies that are more than half a century old. Their answers were analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach to construct a hypothetical model. Results: In total, 46 concepts, four categories, 17 subcategories, and one core category with an analysis result diagram were formed. The diagram shows the successors gained confidence in management through the dilemma between autonomy and constraint in the early stage of succession, which was found in previous research. Following the initial stage, the successors responded to the crisis caused by market constraints such as being stuck in a new market, unreasonable treatment from customers, and created autonomous strategies in their businesses. Conclusions: By experiencing repetitive crises, the successors tend to acquire new perspectives toward the naturally occurring crises. This change of premise by the successors is considered as the process of double-loop learning. Relationships inside and outside the company influence the generation of this viewpoint. From a long-term perspective, a sense of unity with employees, stable employment, and the pursuit of enjoyment constitute the successors' values in this model.

                The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often chronically colonised with a diverse array of bacterial and fungal species. However, little is known about the relative partitioning of species between the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth in the airways. Existing in vivo and in vitro models of CF airway infection are ill-suited for the long-term recapitulation of mixed microbial communities. Here we describe a simple, in vitro continuous-flow model for the cultivation of polymicrobial biofilms and planktonic cultures on different substrata. Our data provide evidence for inter-species antagonism and synergism in biofilm ecology. We further show that the type of substratum on which the biofilms grow has a profound influence on their species composition. This happens without any major alteration in the composition of the surrounding steady-state planktonic community. Our experimentally-tractable model enables the systematic study of planktonic and biofilm communities under conditions that are nutritionally reminiscent of the CF airway microenvironment, something not possible using any existing in vivo models of CF airway infection.

     alt="The effects of orexin-A and orexin receptors on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a male rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder"/>
<p>SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. SPS reduced the expression levels of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and increased the expression levels of OX1R in the mPFC. Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated anxiety-like behaviors, improved the reduction of locomotor activity in SPS rats, and partly restored OX1R levels in the mPFC. Therefore, the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze (EPM), the sucrose preference test (SPT), and the open field (OF) test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

     alt="Morphometric Analysis of Astrocytes in Vocal Production Circuits of Common Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>In the common marmoset, detailed morphological analysis of 3D-reconstructed astrocytes residing in vocal production circuits revealed that, in general, cortical astrocytes are structurally more complex than those residing within midbrain regions.  We hypothesize that this morphological complexity of cortical astrocytes reflects their function in providing neuronal support or modulation of vocalization.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell population in the Central Nervous System (CNS). They play a key role in modulating activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor behaviors. Common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus)</i>, the most vocal non-human primate (NHP) have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role that astrocytes may play in the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step maybe to study their structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to be involved in vocalization. Here, in common marmoset, we identify all astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate’s brains, including intralaminar astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the metabolic/structural needs of these regions.</p>

                Introduction: The objective of this study was to measure the number of cycles to fracture of four continuous or reciprocating rotary nickel-titanium instruments in different materials. Methods: A total of 40 nickel-titanium instruments were used for the present study. Instruments were divided into four groups (n=10): group 1, Revo-S SU; group 2, ProTaper Next X2; group 3, Reciproc R25; group 4, WaveOne Gold Primary. An artificial stainless-steel was used to test the cyclic fatigue of the instruments. The instruments were introduced into the stainless-steel canal, one at a time, until they reached the other end, then they were rotated inside the canal without in-out motion. The time from the beginning of instrument rotation until the occurrence of breakage was recorded. The number of rotated cycles to fracture of the instrument were calculated based on the revolutions per minute (rpm) of each instrument and the recorded rotated time. The mean number of cycles to fracture and standard deviations were calculated and statistically analysed. Results: The number of cycles to fracture of the Revo-S SU was the lowest, and that of the WaveOne Gold Primary was highest. Scanning electronic microscope images of fracture surfaces revealed the characteristics of fatigue. Conclusions: The number of cycles to fracture of the reciprocating WaveOne Gold Primary system was the highest amongst the tested instruments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Empowering young immigrant girls in Canada through the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gender inequality is a global issue. In Canada, 70% of women experience some form of inequality in their lifetime. Immigrant adolescents in Canada make up a substantial proportion of newcomers, and immigrant girls face the threat of subjugation and oppression, which has a significant impact on their health, development, and economic outcomes as well as gender inequality. Research on girls’ empowerment and resilience-building programs and interventions is virtually nonexistent. In this project, we implemented the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The aim of this project was to engage and empower South Asian (SA) immigrant adolescent girls and to promote gender equality in Canada. Methods: This study utilized a qualitative descriptive design. Pre- and post-curriculum implementation focus group discussions were conducted. Results: A total of 16 adolescent girls ranging from 11 to 18 years of age participated in this study. The participants described challenges many young girls face in relation to gender inequality such as gender discrimination, gendered stereotyping, barriers to education, etc. The ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum allowed participants to highlight and reflect on the various problems faced by SA immigrant adolescents in their communities. The participants learned to examine these challenges through a variety of engaging activities to identify their root cause, effects and propose solutions to bring long-lasting change. The curriculum equipped them with useful tools such as decision-makers maps and advocacy skills to educate decision-makers by creating and delivering powerful messages influenced by personal stories and evidence-based literature.  Conclusion: The study provided significant insight into understanding the diverse challenges encountered by SA immigrant adolescent girls in Canada and linking them to the effectiveness of the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The girl-focused development programs that emphasize developing self-confidence, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and decision making are effective in empowering the socially deprived adolescent girls locally and in the global context.

                The K2P-type ion channel TRAAK, which is involved in action potential propagation, generates leak currents and is further activated by mechanical force. Rietmeijer, Sorum, et al. study TRAAK gain-of-function mutations, including those that cause the human neurodevelopmental FHEIG syndrome, and show that leak and mechanically gated openings have distinct structures and electrical properties.

                Matsumoto et al. uncover that cardinal direction selectivity emerges in retinal bipolar cell axon terminals. The selectivity is established de novo at the terminals by starburst amacrine cells, mediated by both cholinergic transmission and wide-field amacrine cells. The bipolar cells transmit tuned glutamate inputs to directional preference-matched ganglion cells.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Current tools to interrogate microglial biology</a></h4>

              
                Microglial cells perform a plethora of functions in the central nervous system (CNS), involving them in brain development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood, and CNS diseases. Significant technical advancements have prompted the development of novel systems adapted to analyze microglia with increasing specificity and intricacy. The advent of single-cell technologies combined with targeted mouse models has been decisive in deciphering microglia heterogeneity and dissecting microglial functions. However sophisticated these tools have become, clear limitations remain. Understanding their pitfalls and advantages ensures their correct application. Therefore, we provide a guide to the cutting-edge methods currently available to dissect microglial biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95.1% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within- and between-host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracellular functions and motile properties of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8 are regulated by neck linker docking</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we analyzed intracellular functions and motile properties of neck-linker (NL) variants of the bi-directional <i>S. cerevisiae</i> kinesin-5 motor, Cin8. We also examined – by modeling – the configuration of H-bonds during NL docking. Decreasing the number of stabilizing H-bonds resulted in partially functional variants, as long as a conserved backbone H-bond at the N-latch position (proposed to stabilize the docked conformation of the NL) remained intact. Elimination of this conserved H-bond resulted in production of a non-functional Cin8 variant. Surprisingly, additional H-bond stabilization of the N-latch position, generated by replacement of the NL of Cin8 by sequences of the plus-end directed kinesin-5 Eg5, also produced a nonfunctional variant. In that variant, a single replacement of N-latch asparagine with glycine, as present in Cin8, eliminated the additional H-bond stabilization and rescued the functional defects. We conclude that exact N-latch stabilization during NL docking is critical for the function of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8.

                Climate change is dramatically changing ecosystem composition and productivity, leading scientists to consider the best approaches to map natural resistance and foster ecosystem resilience in the face of these changes. Here we present results from a large-scale experimental assessment of coral bleaching resistance, a critical trait for coral population persistence as oceans warm, in 221 colonies of the coral <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i> across 37 reefs in Palau. We find that bleaching resistant individuals inhabit most reefs but are found more often in warmer microhabitats. Our survey also found wide variation in symbiont concentration among colonies, and that colonies with lower symbiont load tended to be more bleaching resistant. By contrast, our data show that low symbiont load comes at the cost of lower growth rate, a tradeoff that may operate widely among corals across environments. Corals with high bleaching resistance have been suggested as a source for habitat restoration or selective breeding in order to increase coral reef resilience to climate change. Our maps show where these resilience corals can be found, but the existence of tradeoffs with heat resistance may suggest caution in unilateral use of this one trait in restoration.

                Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles that are critical for cellular lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells. Taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and <i>in vivo </i>imaging opportunities available in zebrafish, we built a suite of tools to study lipid droplets in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently tagging the lipid-droplet-associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, and adipose tissue. Using these tools, we found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high-fat meal and later replaced by perilipin 2. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues, under different genetic and physiological manipulations, and in a variety of human disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rad53 checkpoint kinase regulation of DNA replication fork rate via Mrc1 phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The Rad53 DNA checkpoint protein kinase plays multiple roles in the budding yeast cell response to DNA replication stress. Key amongst these is its enigmatic role in safeguarding DNA replication forks. Using DNA replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we show Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3/7 or Dbf4-dependent kinase blocks replication initiation whilst phosphorylation of Mrc1 or Mcm10 slows elongation. Mrc1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient to slow replication forks in complete reactions; Mcm10 phosphorylation can also slow replication forks, but only in the absence of unphosphorylated Mrc1. Mrc1 stimulates the unwinding rate of the replicative helicase, CMG, and Rad53 phosphorylation of Mrc1 prevents this. We show that a phosphorylation-mimicking Mrc1 mutant cannot stimulate replication <i>in vitro</i> and partially rescues the sensitivity of a <i>rad53</i> null mutant to genotoxic stress <i>in vivo</i>. Our results show that Rad53 protects replication forks in part by antagonising Mrc1 stimulation of CMG unwinding.

                Neuronal cell fate determinants establish the identities of neurons by controlling gene expression to regulate neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. However, it is not understood if neuronal cell fate determinants have postmitotic functions in synapse pattern formation. Here we identify a novel role for UNC-4 homeobox protein and its corepressor UNC-37/Groucho, in tiled synaptic patterning of the cholinergic motor neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that <i>unc-4</i> is not required during neurogenesis but is required in the postmitotic neurons for proper synapse patterning. In contrast, <i>unc-37</i> is required in both developing and postmitotic neurons. The synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> mutants are suppressed by <i>bar-1/β-catenin</i> mutation, which positively regulates the expression of <i>ceh-12/HB9</i>. Ectopic <i>ceh-12</i> expression partly underlies the synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> and <i>unc-37</i> mutants. Our results reveal a novel postmitotic role of neuronal cell fate determinants in synapse pattern formation through inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

                The Patch-seq approach is a powerful variation of the patch-clamp technique that allows for the combined electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic characterization of individual neurons. To generate Patch-seq datasets at scale, we identified and refined key factors that contribute to the efficient collection of high-quality data. We developed patch-clamp electrophysiology software with analysis functions specifically designed to automate acquisition with online quality control. We recognized the importance of extracting the nucleus for transcriptomic success and maximizing membrane integrity during nucleus extraction for morphology success. The protocol is generalizable to different species and brain regions, as demonstrated by capturing multimodal data from human and macaque brain slices. The protocol, analysis and acquisition software are compiled at https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools. This resource can be used by individual labs to generate data across diverse mammalian species and that is compatible with large publicly available Patch-seq datasets.

                Sleep spindles are major oscillatory components of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, reflecting hyperpolarization-rebound sequences of thalamocortical neurons, the inhibition of which is caused by the NREM-dependent activation of GABAergic neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. Reports suggest a link between sleep spindles and several forms of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) which are considered as expressions of pathological off-line neural plasticity in the central nervous system. Here we investigated the relationship between thalamic sleep spindles, IEDs and ripples in the anterior and mediodorsal nuclei (ANT and MD) of epilepsy patients. Whole-night LFP from the ANT and MD were co-registered with scalp EEG/polysomnography by using externalized leads in 15 epilepsy patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation protocol. Slow (~12 Hz) and fast (~14 Hz) sleep spindles were present in the human ANT and MD. Roughly, one third of thalamic sleep spindles were associated with IEDs or ripples. Both IED- and ripple-associated spindles were longer than pure spindles. IED-associated thalamic sleep spindles were characterized by broadband increase in thalamic and cortical activity, both below and above the spindle frequency range, whereas ripple-associated thalamic spindles exceeded pure spindles in terms of 80-200 Hz thalamic, but not cortical activity as indicated by time-frequency analysis. These result show that thalamic spindles coupled with IEDs are reflected at the scalp slow and beta-gamma oscillation as well. IED density during sleep spindles in the MD, but not in the ANT was identified as correlates of years spent with epilepsy, whereas no signs of pathological processes were correlated with measures of ripple and spindle association. Furthermore, the density of ripple-associated sleep spindles in the ANT showed a positive correlation with general intelligence. Our findings indicate the complex and multifaceted role of the human thalamus in sleep spindle-related physiological and pathological neural plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phase-locking patterns underlying effective communication in exact firing rate models of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory establishes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phaselocking and selective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The diazepam binding inhibitors modulation of the GABA-A receptor is subunit-dependent</a></h4>

              
                First synthesized in the 1950s, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed drugs that exert their anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant actions by binding to GABA-A receptors, the main inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel in the brain. Scientists have long theorized that there exists an endogenous benzodiazepine, or endozepine, in the brain. While there is indirect evidence suggesting a peptide, the diazepam binding inhibitor, is capable of modulating the GABA-A receptor, direct evidence of the modulatory effects of the diazepam binding inhibitor is limited. Here we take a reductionist approach to understand how purified diazepam binding inhibitor interacts with and affects GABA-A receptor activity. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to study how the effects of diazepam binding inhibitor vary with GABA-A receptor subunit composition, and found that GABA-evoked currents from 3-containing GABA-A receptors are weakly inhibited by the diazepam binding inhibitor, while currents from 5-containing receptors are positively modulated. We also used in silico   protein-protein docking to visualize potential diazepam binding inhibitor/GABA-A receptor interactions that revealed diazepam binding inhibitor bound at the benzodiazepine /{gamma} binding site interface, which provides a structural framework for understanding diazepam binding inhibitor effects on GABA-A receptors. Our results provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying how the diazepam binding inhibitor modulates GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The temporal dynamics of the Stroop effect from childhood to young and older adulthood</a></h4>

              
                It is well admitted that children and older adults tend to show longer response latencies at the Stroop task than young adults. The present study aims at clarifying the rational of such changes from childhood to adulthood and in ageing by comparing the impacted cognitive processes across age groups. More precisely, the aim was to clarify if all processes take more time to be executed, hence implying that longer latencies rely mainly on processing speed or if an additional process lengthens the resolution of the conflict in children and/or older adults. To this aim we recorded brain electrical activity using EEG in school-age children, young and older adults while they performed a classic verbal Stroop task. To decompose the signal in the underlying brain networks, we used microstates analyses and compared congruent, incongruent and neutral trials across the three age-groups. Behaviorally, children and older adults presented longer latencies and larger Stroop effects relative to young adults. The microstates results showed that children tend to present different brain configurations compared to both adult groups, even though some brain configurations remained identical among the three groups. In particular, additional brain networks were involved in children to perform the Stroop task, which party account for the longer latencies in this group. By contrast, in aging the results favor the general slowing hypothesis rather than a decline in a specific process since all involved brain networks were similar in the two adult groups but slowed down in the older one.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An approximate stochastic optimal control framework to simulate nonlinear neuromusculoskeletal models in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                Optimal control simulations have shown that both musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise are important determinants of movement. However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.

                Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that present a target for insecticides. However, a better understanding of receptor subunit composition is needed for effective design of insecticides. Peptide neurotoxins are known to block nAChRs by binding to its target subunits. To facilitate the analysis of nAChRs we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate null alleles for all ten nAChR subunit genes. We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles we determined the effects of -Bungarotoxin (-Btx) and {omega}-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm -Btx interactions with the D5, D6, D7 subunits. Finally, we report the localization of fluorescent tagged endogenous D6 during nervous system development. Taken together this study elucidates native Drosophila nAChR subunit interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins.

                Astrocyte-derived cholesterol supports brain cells under physiological conditions. However, in demyelinating lesions, astrocytes downregulate cholesterol synthesis and the cholesterol that is essential for remyelination has to originate from other cellular sources. Here, we show that repair following acute versus chronic demyelination involves distinct processes. In particular, we found that in chronic myelin disease, when recycling of lipids is often defective, de novo neuronal cholesterol synthesis is critical for regeneration. By gene expression profiling, genetic loss of function experiments and comprehensive phenotyping, we provide evidence that neurons increase cholesterol synthesis in chronic myelin disease models and MS patients. In mouse models, neuronal cholesterol facilitated remyelination specifically by triggering OPC proliferation. Our data contribute to the understanding of disease progression and have implications for therapeutic strategies in MS patients.

                Current theories of motor control emphasize forward models as a critical component of the brain's motor execution and learning networks. These internal models are thought to predict the consequences of movement before sensory feedback from these movements can reach the brain, allowing for smooth, continuous online motor performance and for the computation of prediction errors that drive implicit motor learning. Taking this framework to its logical extreme, we tested the hypothesis that movements are not necessary for the generation of predictions, the computation of prediction errors, and implicit motor adaptation. Human participants were cued to move a computer mouse to a visually displayed target and were subsequently cued to withhold those movements on a subset of trials. Visual errors displayed on both trials with and without movements to the target induced single-trial learning. Furthermore, learning on trials without movements persisted when accompanying movement trials were never paired with errors and when movement and sensory feedback trajectories were decoupled. These data provide compelling evidence supporting an internal model framework in which forward models generate sensory predictions independent of the generation of movements.

                Animal research suggests a central role of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system in mediating contact seeking and the stress-buffering function of social touch. However, the human neurochemistry of social motivation in aversive situations is still poorly understood. In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject design, healthy female volunteers (N = 80) received either 10 mg of the mu-opioid agonist morphine sulfate or a placebo. Following psychosocial stress induction, participants engaged in a social reward task, in which the motivation (subjective ratings of wanting and physical effort) to obtain skin-to-skin social touch and the hedonic reactions (subjective ratings of liking and facial electromyography) elicited by it were assessed. Morphine administration prevented the increase of salivary cortisol, usually observed in response to acute stress exposure. The dampened physiological reaction to the psychosocial stress was associated with increased negative mood and subsequent higher subjective wanting of the most pleasurable touch. Furthermore, participants administered with morphine displayed greater activity of the corrugator muscle during reward anticipation, possibly tracking enhanced attention toward the social stimuli. Overall, the results provide novel evidence on the effect of exogenous opioids administration on the reactions to psychosocial stress and point to a state-dependent regulation of social motivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A-GHN: Attention-based Fusion of Multiple GraphHeat Networks for Structural to Functional Brain Mapping</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in learning the mapping from structural connectivity (SC) to functional connectivity (FC) of the brain. The spontaneous fluctuations of the brain activity during the resting-state as captured by functional MRI (rsfMRI) contain rich non-stationary dynamics over a relatively fixed structural connectome. Among the modeling approaches, graph diffusion-based methods with single and multiple diffusion kernels approximating static or dynamic functional connectivity have shown promise in predicting the FC given the SC. However, these methods are computationally expensive, not scalable, and fail to capture the complex dynamics underlying the whole process. Recently, deep learning methods such as GraphHeat networks along with graph diffusion have been shown to handle complex relational structures while preserving global information. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based fusion of multiple GraphHeat networks (A-GHN) for mapping SC-FC. A-GHN enables us to model multiple heat kernel diffusion over the brain graph for approximating the complex Reaction Diffusion phenomenon. We argue that the proposed deep learning method overcomes the scalability and computational inefficiency issues but can still learn the SC-FC mapping successfully. Training and testing were done using the rsfMRI data of 100 participants from the human connectome project (HCP), and the results establish the viability of the proposed model. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that A-GHN outperforms the existing methods in learning the complex nature of human brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humanoid robots are perceived as an evolutionary threat</a></h4>

              
                In the grand challenges of successful social encounters with socially sophisticated robots and shaping the future development of robots in socially acceptable ways, we need to quantify people perception to the robots. The critical assumption at the perception to humanoid robots, namely that people perceive humanoid robots as an evolutionary threat, has not been directly confirmed. We assume the existence of behavioral and neural automaticity for humanoid robots that were previously only evident for evolutionary threats. Here, we observed a monocular advantage for the perception of humanoid robots the same as an evolutionary threat (i.e., snakes). Our neuroimaging analysis indicated that unconscious presentation of humanoid robot vs. human images led to significant left amygdala activation that was associated with negative implicit attitude to humanoid robots. After successfully weakening negative attitude, the left amygdala response to unconscious presentation of humanoid robot images decreased, and the decrease of left amygdala response was positively associated with the decrease of negative attitude. Our results reveal that processing of information about humanoid robots displays automaticity with regard to recruitment of visual pathway and amygdala activation. Our findings that humans may perceive humanoid robots as an evolutionary threat will guide the future direction of robots development and bring us closer to interacting with socially sophisticated robots.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal properties of painful contrast enhancement using repetitive stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Offset analgesia is characterized by a disproportionately large reduction in pain following a small decrease in a heat stimulus and is based on the phenomenon of temporal pain contrast enhancement (TPCE). The aim of this study is to investigate whether this phenomenon can also be induced by repetitive stimulation, i.e., by stimuli that are clearly separated in time. With this aim, the repetitive TPCE paradigm was induced in healthy, pain-free subjects (n=33) at the volar non-dominant forearm using heat stimuli. This paradigm was performed applying three different interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 5, 15, and 25 seconds. All paradigms were contrasted with a control paradigm without temperature change. Participants continuously rated the perceived pain intensity. In addition, electrodermal activity was recorded as a surrogate measure of autonomic arousal. Temporal pain contrast enhancement was confirmed for both ISI 5 seconds (p < 0.001) and ISI 15 seconds (p = 0.005), but not for ISI 25 seconds (p = 0.07), however the magnitude of TPCE did not differ between ISIs (p = 0.11). Electrodermal activity was consistent previous pain ratings, but showing significantly higher autonomic activity being measured. Thus, the phenomenon of temporal contrast enhancement of pain can also be induced by repetitive stimulation. Both the involvement of the autonomic nervous system and the involvement of habituation processes are conceivable, which consequently points to both central and peripheral mechanisms of TPCE.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic and functional analysis of Aβ1-42 oligomer-stimulated human monocyte-derived microglia-like cells</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation of microglial function contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Several genetic and transcriptome studies have revealed microglia specific genetic risk factors, and changes in microglia expression profiles in AD pathogenesis, viz. the human-Alzheimer's microglia/myeloid (HAM) profile in AD patients and the disease-associated microglia profile (DAM) in AD mouse models. The transcriptional changes involve genes in immune and inflammatory pathways, and in pathways associated with A{beta} clearance. A{beta} oligomers have been suggested to be the initial trigger of microglia activation in AD. To study the direct response to A{beta} oligomers exposure, we assessed changes in gene expression in an in vitro model for microglia, the human monocyte-derived microglial-like (MDMi) cells. We confirmed the initiation of an inflammatory profile following LPS stimulation, based on increased expression of IL1B, IL6, and TNF. In contrast, the A{beta}1-42 oligomers did not induce an inflammatory profile or a classical HAM or DAM profile. Interestingly, we observed a specific increase in the expression of metallothioneins in the A{beta}1-42 oligomer treated MDMi cells. Metallothioneins are involved in metal ion regulation, protection against reactive oxygen species, and have anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, our data suggests that A{beta}1-42 oligomers may trigger a protective response both in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stoney vs. Histed: Quantifying the Spatial Effects of Intracortical Microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is used to map neural circuits and restore lost sensory modalities such as vision, hearing, and somatosensation. The spatial effects of ICMS remain controversial: Stoney and colleagues proposed that the volume of somatic activation increased with stimulation intensity, while Histed et al. suggested activation density, but not somatic activation volume, increases with stimulation intensity. Objective: We used computational modeling to quantify the spatial effects of ICMS intensity and unify the apparently paradoxical findings of Histed and Stoney. Methods: We implemented a biophysically-based computational model of a cortical column comprising neurons with realistic morphology and representative synapses. We quantified the spatial effects of single pulse ICMS, including the radial distance to activated neurons and the density of activated neurons as a function of stimulation intensity. Results: At all amplitudes, the dominant mode of somatic activation was by antidromic propagation to the soma following axonal activation, rather than via trans-synaptic activation. There were no occurrences of direct activation of somata or dendrites. The volume over which antidromic action potentials were initiated grew with stimulation amplitude, while the volume of somatic activations did not. However, the density of somatic activation within the activated volume increased with stimulation amplitude. Conclusions: The results resolve the apparent paradox between Stoney and Histed's results by demonstrating that the volume over which action potentials are initiated grows with ICMS amplitude, consistent with Stoney. However, the volume occupied by the activated somata remains approximately constant, while the density of activated neurons within that volume increase, consistent with Histed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gut bacteria regulate the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the composition of gut microbiota are implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we investigated whether gut bacteria affect the hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD) in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models expressing human full-length or N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein, here referred to as HD flies. We find that elimination of commensal gut bacteria by antibiotics reduces the aggregation of amyloidogenic N-terminal fragments of HTT and delays the development of motor defects. Conversely, colonization of HD flies with Escherichia coli (E. coli), a known pathobiont of human gut, accelerates HTT aggregation, aggravates immobility and shortens life span. Similar to antibiotics, treatment of HD flies with compounds such as luteolin, a flavone, or crocin a beta-carotenoid, ameliorates disease phenotypes and promotes survival. Crocin prevents colonization of E. coli in the HD flies gut and alters the levels of commensal bacteria, which may be linked to its protective effects. The opposing effects of E. coli and crocin on HTT aggregation, motor defects and survival in transgenic Drosophila support the involvement of gut-brain networks in the pathogenesis of HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subtle alterations in neonatal neurodevelopment following early or late exposure to prenatal maternal immune activation</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The timing of MIA-exposure has been shown to affect adolescent and adult offspring neurodevelopment, however, less is known about these effects in the neonatal period. To better understand the impact of MIA-exposure on neonatal brain development, we first assess neonate communicative abilities with the ultrasonic vocalization task, followed by high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the neonatal (postnatal day 8) brain. Early exposed offspring displayed decreased communicative ability, while brain anatomy appeared largely unaffected, apart from some subtle alterations. By integrating MRI and behavioural assays to investigate the effects of MIA-exposure on neonatal neurodevelopment we show that offspring neuroanatomy and behaviour are only subtly affected by both early and late exposure. This suggests that the deficits often observed in later stages of life may be dormant, not yet developed in the neonatal period, or not as easily detectable using a cross-sectional approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Carbon Fiber Electrodes for Intracellular Recording and Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                To understand neural circuit dynamics, it is critical to manipulate and record from many neurons, ideally at the single neuron level. Traditional recording methods, such as glass microelectrodes, can only control a small number of neurons. More recently, devices with high electrode density have been developed, but few of them can be used for intracellular recording or stimulation in intact nervous systems, rather than on neuronal cultures. Carbon fiber electrodes (CFEs) are 8 micron-diameter electrodes that can be organized into arrays with pitches as low as 80 m. They have been shown to have good signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and are capable of stable extracellular recording during both acute and chronic implantation in vivo in neural tissue such as rat motor cortex. Given the small fiber size, it is possible that they could be used in arrays for intracellular stimulation. We tested this using the large identified and electrically compact neurons of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. The cell bodies of neurons in Aplysia range in size from 30 to over 250 m. We compared the efficacy of CFEs to glass microelectrodes by impaling the same neuron's cell body with both electrodes and connecting them to a DC coupled amplifier. We observed that intracellular waveforms were essentially identical, but the amplitude and SNR in the CFE were lower than in the glass microelectrode. CFE arrays could record from 3 to 8 neurons simultaneously for many hours, and many of these recordings were intracellular as shown by recording from the same neuron using a glass microelectrode. Stimulating through CFEs coated with platinum-iridium had stable impedances over many hours. CFEs not within neurons could record local extracellular activity. Despite the lower SNR, the CFEs could record synaptic potentials. Thus, the stability for multi-channel recording and the ability to stimulate and record intracellularly make CFEs a powerful new technology for studying neural circuit dynamics.

	<p>Drug addiction is thought to be driven by negative reinforcement, and it is thought that a shift from positive affect upon initial exposure to negative affect after chronic exposure to a drug is responsible for maintaining self-administration (SA) in addicted individuals. This can be modeled in rats by analyzing ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a type of intraspecies communication indicative of affective state based on the frequency of the emission: calls in the 22 kHz range indicate negative affect, whereas calls in the 50 kHz range indicate positive affect. We employed a voluntary chronic, long-access model of fentanyl SA to analyze affective changes in the response to chronic fentanyl exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered either fentanyl (N = 7) or saline (N = 6) for 30 consecutive days and USVs were recorded at four different time points: the day before first SA session (PRE), the first day of SA (T01), the last day of SA (T30), and the first day of abstinence (ABS). At T01, the ratio of 50 to 22 kHz calls was similar between the fentanyl and saline groups, but at T30, the ratio differed between groups, with the fentanyl group showing significantly fewer 50 kHz calls and more 22 kHz calls relative to saline animals. These results indicate a shift toward a negative affect during drug use after chronic exposure to fentanyl and support negative reinforcement as a main driving factor of opioid addiction.</p>

	<p>Functional neuroimaging studies have highlighted the roles of three networks in processing language, all of which are typically left-lateralized: a ventral stream involved in semantics, a dorsal stream involved in phonology and speech production, and a more dorsal “multiple demand” network involved in many effortful tasks. As lateralization in all networks may be affected by life factors such as age, literacy, education, and brain pathology, we sought to develop a task paradigm with which to investigate the engagement of these networks, including manipulations to selectively emphasize semantic and phonological processing within a single task performable by almost anyone regardless of literacy status. In young healthy participants, we administered an auditory word monitoring task, in which participants had to note the occurrence of a target word within a continuous story presented in either their native language, Portuguese, or the unknown language, Japanese. Native language task performance activated ventral stream language networks, left lateralized but bilateral in the anterior temporal lobe. Unfamiliar language performance, being more difficult, activated left hemisphere dorsal stream structures and the multiple demand network bilaterally, but predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that increased demands on phonological processing to accomplish word monitoring in the absence of semantic support may result in the bilateral recruitment of networks involved in speech perception under more challenging conditions.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent pediatric neurologic impairment and is associated with major mobility deficiencies. This has led to extensive investigations of the sensorimotor network, with far less research focusing on other major networks. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) of the main sensory networks (i.e., visual and auditory) and the sensorimotor network, and to link FC to the gait biomechanics of youth with CP. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we first identified the sensorimotor, visual and auditory networks in youth with CP and neurotypical controls. Our analysis revealed reduced FC among the networks in the youth with CP relative to the controls. Notably, the visual network showed lower FC with both the sensorimotor and auditory networks. Furthermore, higher FC between the visual and sensorimotor cortices was associated with larger step length (r = 0.74, pFDR = 0.04) in youth with CP. These results confirm that CP is associated with functional brain abnormalities beyond the sensorimotor network, suggesting abnormal functional integration of the brain’s motor and primary sensory systems. The significant association between abnormal visuo-motor FC and gait could indicate a link with visuomotor disorders in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which can affect 65 million patients worldwide. Recently, network based analyses have been of great help in the investigation of seizures. Now graph theory is commonly applied to analyze functional brain networks, but functional brain networks are dynamic. Methods based on graph theory find it difficult to reflect the dynamic changes of functional brain network. In this paper, an approach to extracting features from brain functional networks is presented. Dynamic functional brain networks can be obtained by stacking multiple functional brain networks on the time axis. Then, a tensor decomposition method is used to extract features, and an ELM classifier is introduced to complete epilepsy prediction. In the prediction of epilepsy, the accuracy and F1 score of the feature extracted by tensor decomposition are higher than the degree and clustering coefficient. The features extracted from the dynamic functional brain network by tensor decomposition show better and more comprehensive performance than degree and clustering coefficient in epilepsy prediction.</p>

                Once inside the host cell, DNA viruses must overcome the physical barrier posed by the nuclear envelope to establish a successful infection. The mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Here, we show that the herpesvirus exploits the immune adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to facilitate nuclear import of the...

                The pairing of homologous chromosomes represents a critical step of meiosis in nearly all sexually reproducing species. In many organisms, pairing involves chromosomes that remain apparently intact. The mechanistic nature of homology recognition at the basis of such pairing is unknown. Using “meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA” (MSUD) as a...

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular phenotyping reveals the identity of Barretts esophagus and its malignant transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The origin of human metaplastic states and their propensity for cancer is poorly understood. Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural basis for target site selection in RNA-guided DNA transposition systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>CRISPR-associated transposition systems allow guide RNA&ndash;directed integration of a single DNA cargo in one orientation at a fixed distance from a programmable target sequence. We used cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate&ndash;bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP&bull;AlF<SUB>3</SUB>. These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.</p>

We report the discovery of a family of copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in plant pathogenic oomycetes and its role in plant infection by <I>P. infestans</I>. We show that LPMO-encoding genes are up-regulated early during infection and that the secreted enzymes oxidatively cleave the backbone of pectin, a charged polysaccharide in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of the most abundant of these LPMOs sheds light on its ability to recognize and degrade pectin, and silencing the encoding gene in <I>P. infestans</I> inhibits infection of potato, indicating a role in host penetration. The identification of LPMOs as virulence factors in pathogenic oomycetes opens up opportunities in crop protection and food security.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Observation of microwave shielding of ultracold molecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>Harnessing the potential wide-ranging quantum science applications of molecules will require control of their interactions. Here, we used microwave radiation to directly engineer and tune the interaction potentials between ultracold calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. By merging two optical tweezers, each containing a single molecule, we probed collisions in three dimensions. The correct combination of microwave frequency and power created an effective repulsive shield, which suppressed the inelastic loss rate by a factor of six, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The demonstrated microwave shielding shows a general route to the creation of long-lived, dense samples of ultracold polar molecules and evaporative cooling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Chemically recyclable thermoplastics from reversible-deactivation polymerization of cyclic acetals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identifying plastics capable of chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the foremost challenge in creating a sustainable circular plastic economy. Polyacetals are promising candidates for CRM but lack useful tensile strengths owing to the low molecular weights produced using current uncontrolled cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) methods. Here, we present reversible-deactivation CROP of cyclic acetals using a commercial halomethyl ether initiator and an indium(III) bromide catalyst. Using this method, we synthesize poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDXL), which demonstrates tensile strength comparable to some commodity polyolefins. Depolymerization of PDXL using strong acid catalysts returns monomer in near-quantitative yield and even proceeds from a commodity plastic waste mixture. Our efficient polymerization method affords a tough thermoplastic that can undergo selective depolymerization to monomer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A characteristic optical variability time scale in astrophysical accretion disks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A fossil record of land plant origins from charophyte algae</a></h4>

              
                <p>Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Multicomponent superconducting order parameter in UTe2</a></h4>

              
                <p>An unconventional superconducting state was recently discovered in uranium&nbsp;ditelluride (UTe<SUB>2</SUB>), in which spin-triplet superconductivity emerges from the paramagnetic normal state of a heavy-fermion material. The coexistence of magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity, together with the crystal structure of this material, suggests that a distinctive set of symmetries, magnetic properties, and topology underlie the superconducting state. Here, we report observations of a nonzero polar Kerr effect and of two transitions in the specific heat upon entering the superconducting state, which together suggest that the superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB> is characterized by a two-component order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. These data place constraints on the symmetries of the order parameter and inform the discussion on the presence of topological superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>
