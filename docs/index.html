              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97487">Target-specific requirements for RNA interference can arise through restricted RNA amplification despite the lack of specialized pathways</a></h4>

              
                Since double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference (RNAi). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that (1) changing <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, (2) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0063-24.2024?rss=1">The Projection-Specific Noradrenergic Modulation of Perseverative Spatial Behavior in Adult Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on efficient cognitive control. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a key node within the executive prefrontal network. The reciprocal connectivity between the locus ceruleus (LC) and ACC is thought to support behavioral reorganization triggered by the detection of an unexpected change. We transduced LC neurons with either excitatory or inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in adult male rats and trained rats on a spatial task. Subsequently, we altered LC activity and confronted rats with an unexpected change of reward locations. In a new spatial context, rats with decreased noradrenaline (NA) in the ACC entered unbaited maze arms more persistently which was indicative of perseveration. In contrast, the suppression of the global NA transmission reduced perseveration. Neither chemogenetic manipulation nor inactivation of the ACC by muscimol affected the rate of learning, possibly due to partial virus transduction of the LC neurons and/or the compensatory engagement of other prefrontal regions. Importantly, we observed behavioral deficits in rats with LC damage caused by virus injection. The latter finding highlights the importance of careful histological assessment of virus-transduced brain tissue as inadvertent damage of the targeted cell population due to virus neurotoxicity or other factors might cause unwanted side effects. Although the specific role of ACC in the flexibility of spatial behavior has not been convincingly demonstrated, our results support the beneficial role of noradrenergic transmission for an optimal function of the ACC. Overall, our findings suggest the LC exerts the projection-specific modulation of neural circuits mediating the flexibility of spatial behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/8/ENEURO.0115-24.2024?rss=1">Somatostatin Interneurons Recruit Pre- and Postsynaptic GABAB Receptors in the Adult Mouse Dentate Gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The integration of spatial information in the mammalian dentate gyrus (DG) is critical to navigation. Indeed, DG granule cells (DGCs) rely upon finely balanced inhibitory neurotransmission in order to respond appropriately to specific spatial inputs. This inhibition arises from a heterogeneous population of local GABAergic interneurons (INs) that activate both fast, ionotropic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) and slow, metabotropic GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R), respectively. GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs in turn inhibit pre- and postsynaptic neuronal compartments via temporally long-lasting G-protein-dependent mechanisms. The relative contribution of each IN subtype to network level GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signal setting remains unknown. However, within the DG, the somatostatin (SSt) expressing IN subtype is considered crucial in coordinating appropriate feedback inhibition on to DGCs. Therefore, we virally delivered channelrhodopsin 2 to the DG in order to obtain control of this specific SSt IN subpopulation in male and female adult mice. Using a combination of optogenetic activation and pharmacology, we show that SSt INs strongly recruit postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs to drive greater inhibition in DGCs than GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs at physiological membrane potentials. Furthermore, we show that in the adult mouse DG, postsynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling is predominantly regulated by neuronal GABA uptake and less so by astrocytic mechanisms. Finally, we confirm that activation of SSt INs can also recruit presynaptic GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs, as has been shown in neocortical circuits. Together, these data reveal that GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R signaling allows SSt INs to control DG activity and may constitute a key mechanism for gating spatial information flow within hippocampal circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012388">The rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diogo L. Pires, Mark Broom</p>

Community organisation permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behaviour emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organise into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organisation dominates over the network structure and emerging behaviour is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared among communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (<i>Q</i>) and number (<i>M</i>) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (<i>V</i>/<i>K</i>) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organisation is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organised into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game yields mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.

                <p>by Ayooluwa J. Bolaji, Ana T. Duggan</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought molecular biology and genomic sequencing into the public consciousness and lexicon. With an emphasis on rapid turnaround, genomic data informed both diagnostic and surveillance decisions for the current pandemic at a previously unheard-of scale. The surge in the submission of genomic data to publicly available databases proved essential as comparing different genome sequences offers a wealth of knowledge, including phylogenetic links, modes of transmission, rates of evolution, and the impact of mutations on infection and disease severity. However, the scale of the pandemic has meant that sequencing runs are rarely repeated due to limited sample material and/or the availability of sequencing resources, resulting in the upload of some imperfect runs to public repositories. As a result, it is crucial to investigate the data obtained from these imperfect runs to determine whether the results are reliable prior to depositing them in a public database. Numerous studies have identified a variety of sources of contamination in public next-generation sequencing (NGS) data as the number of NGS studies increases along with the diversity of sequencing technologies and procedures. For this study, we conducted an <i>in silico</i> experiment with known SARS-CoV-2 sequences produced from Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing to investigate the effect of contamination on lineage calls and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). A contamination threshold below which runs are expected to generate accurate lineage calls and maintain genome-relatedness and integrity was identified. Together, these findings provide a benchmark below which imperfect runs may be considered robust for reporting results to both stakeholders and public repositories and reduce the need for repeat or wasted runs.

                <p>by Yang Xu, Erez Cohen, Craig N. Johnson, Carole A. Parent, Pierre A. Coulombe</p>

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to reach inflamed sites and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Yet, little is known about the pattern of neutrophil infiltration in inflamed skin in vivo and the mechanisms mediating their recruitment. Here, we provide insight into the dynamics of neutrophil infiltration in skin in response to acute or repeated inflammatory stress, highlighting a novel keratinocyte- and keratin 17 (K17)-dependent mechanism that regulates neutrophil recruitment to inflamed skin. We used the phorbol ester TPA and UVB, alone or in combination, to induce sterile inflammation in mouse skin. A single TPA treatment results in a neutrophil influx in the dermis that peaks at 12 h and resolves within 24 h. A subsequent TPA treatment or a UVB challenge, when applied 24 h but not 48 h later, accelerates, amplifies, and prolongs neutrophil infiltration. This transient amplification response (TAR) is mediated by local signals in inflamed skin, can be recapitulated in ex vivo culture, and involves the K17-dependent sustainment of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity and release of chemoattractants by stressed keratinocytes. K17 binds RACK1, a scaffold protein essential for PKCα activity. The N-terminal head domain of K17 is crucial for its association with RACK1 and regulation of PKCα activity. Analysis of RNAseq data reveals a signature consistent with TAR and PKCα activation in inflammatory skin diseases. These findings uncover a novel, keratin-dependent mechanism that amplifies neutrophil recruitment in skin under stress, with direct implications for inflammatory skin disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002766">A noninvasive BCG skin challenge model for assessing tuberculosis vaccine efficacy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nitya Krishnan, Miles Priestman, Iria Uhía, Natalie Charitakis, Izabella T. Glegola-Madejska, Thomas M. Baer, Albin Tranberg, Alan Faraj, Ulrika SH Simonsson, Brian D. Robertson</p>

We report here on the characterisation in mice of a noninvasive bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) skin challenge model for assessing tuberculosis (TB) vaccine efficacy. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) are valuable tools for assessing the relevant biological activity of vaccine candidates, with the potential to accelerate TB vaccine development into the clinic. TB infection poses significant constraints on the design of a CHIM using the causative agent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb). A safer alternative is a challenge model using the attenuated vaccine agent <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> BCG as a surrogate for Mtb, and intradermal (skin) challenge as an alternative to pulmonary infection. We have developed a unique noninvasive imaging system based on fluorescent reporters (FluorBCG) to quantitatively measure bacterial load over time, thereby determining a relevant biological vaccine effect. We assessed the utility of this model to measure the effectiveness of 2 TB vaccines: the currently licenced BCG and a novel subunit vaccine candidate. To assess the efficacy of the skin challenge model, a nonlinear mixed effect model was built describing the decline of fluorescence over time. The model-based analysis identified that BCG vaccination reduced the fluorescence readout of both fluorophores compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, vaccination with the novel subunit candidate did not alter the fluorescence decline compared to unvaccinated mice (<i>p</i> > 0.05). BCG-vaccinated mice that showed the reduced fluorescent readout also had a reduced bacterial burden in the lungs when challenged with Mtb. This supports the fluorescence activity in the skin as a reflection of vaccine induced functional pulmonary immune responses. This novel noninvasive approach allows for repeated measurements from the challenge site, providing a dynamic readout of vaccine induced responses over time. This BCG skin challenge model represents an important contribution to the ongoing development of controlled challenge models for TB.

                <p>by Sriraksha Srinivasan, Andrea Di Luca, Daniel Álvarez, Arun T. John Peter, Charlotte Gehin, Museer A. Lone, Thorsten Hornemann, Giovanni D’Angelo, Stefano Vanni</p>

Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are key players in cellular homeostasis and regulation, as they coordinate the exchange of lipids between different cellular organelles. Despite their importance, our mechanistic understanding of how LTPs function at the molecular level is still in its infancy, mostly due to the large number of existing LTPs and to the low degree of conservation at the sequence and structural level. In this work, we use molecular simulations to characterize a representative dataset of lipid transport domains (LTDs) of 12 LTPs that belong to 8 distinct families. We find that despite no sequence homology nor structural conservation, the conformational landscape of LTDs displays common features, characterized by the presence of at least 2 main conformations whose populations are modulated by the presence of the bound lipid. These conformational properties correlate with their mechanistic mode of action, allowing for the interpretation and design of experimental strategies to further dissect their mechanism. Our findings indicate the existence of a conserved, fold-independent mechanism of lipid transfer across LTPs of various families and offer a general framework for understanding their functional mechanism.

Dynamic properties are essential for microtubule (MT) physiology. Current techniques for in vivo imaging of MTs present intrinsic limitations in elucidating the isotype-specific nuances of tubulins, which contribute to their versatile functions. Harnessing the power of the AlphaFold2 pipeline, we engineered a strategy for the minimally invasive fluorescence labeling of endogenous tubulin isotypes or those harboring missense mutations. We demonstrated that a specifically designed 16-amino acid linker, coupled with sfGFP11 from the split-sfGFP system and integration into the H1-S2 loop of tubulin, facilitated tubulin labeling without compromising MT dynamics, embryonic development, or ciliogenesis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Extending this technique to human cells and murine oocytes, we visualized MTs with the minimal background fluorescence and a pathogenic tubulin isoform with fidelity. The utility of our approach across biological contexts and species set an additional paradigm for studying tubulin dynamics and functional specificity, with implications for understanding tubulin-related diseases known as tubulinopathies.

<p>Disrupted connectivity between the amygdala and the default mode network (DMN) is highlighted in schizophrenia, with significant changes observed in specific amygdala subregions after treatment.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disrupted connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is well-documented in schizophrenia (SCZ). The amygdala, a key component in the neurobiology of SCZ, comprises distinct subregions that may exert varying effects on the disorder. This study aimed to investigate variations in functional connectivity (FC) between distinct amygdala subregions and the DMN in SCZ individuals and explore the effects of treatment on these connections. Fifty-six SCZ patients and 51 healthy controls underwent FC analysis and questionnaire surveys during resting state. The amygdala was selected as the region of interest (ROI) and subdivided into four parts. Changes in FC were examined, and correlations between questionnaire scores and brain activity were explored. Pre-treatment, SCZ patients exhibited reduced FC between the amygdala and DMN compared to HCs. After treatment, significant differences persisted in the right medial amygdala, while other regions did not differ significantly from controls. In addition, PANSS scores positively correlated with FC between the Right Medial Amygdala and the left SMFC (<i>r</i> = .347, <i>p</i> = .009), while RBANS5A scores showed a positive correlation with FC between the Left Lateral Amygdala and the right MTG (rho = −.347, <i>p</i> = .009). The rsFC between the amygdala and the DMN plays a crucial role in the treatment mechanisms of SCZ. This could provide a promising predictive indicator for understanding the neural mechanisms behind treatment and symptomatic improvement.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resistance exercise training (RET) is considered an excellent tool for preventing diseases with an inflammatory background. Its neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for positively modulating cholinergic and oxidative systems, promoting neurogenesis, and improving memory. However, the mechanisms behind these actions are largely unknown. In order to investigate the pathways related to these effects of exercise, we conducted a 12-week long-term exercise training protocol and used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce damage to the cortex and hippocampus of male Wistar rats. The cholinergic system, oxidative stress, and histochemical parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and memory tests were also performed. It was observed that LPS: (1) caused memory loss in the novel object recognition (NOR) test; (2) increased the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Iba1 protein density; (3) reduced the protein density of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1); (4) elevated the levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and reactive species (RS); and (5) caused inflammatory damage to the dentate gyrus. RET, on the other hand, was able to prevent all alterations induced by LPS, as well as increase per se the protein density of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRα7) and Nestin, and the levels of protein thiols (T-SH). Overall, our study elucidates some mechanisms that support resistance physical exercise as a valuable approach against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and memory loss.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) can result from dominant, gain of function variants of neuronal ion channels. More than 450 de novo missense variants of the sodium channel gene <i>SCN8A</i> have been identified in individuals with DEE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied a mouse model carrying the patient <i>Scn8a</i> variant p.Asn1768Asp. An AAV-PHP.eB virus carrying an allele-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Cas9 was provided by an inherited transgene.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Allele-specific disruption of the reading frame of the pathogenic transcript generated out-of-frame indels in 1/4 to 1/3 of transcripts throughout the brain. This editing efficiency was sufficient to rescue lethality and seizures. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reduced in cells expressing the virus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data demonstrate efficient allele-specific editing of a dominant missense variant and support the feasibility of allele-specific therapy for DEE epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96652">Beyond Haldane’s rule: Sex-biased hybrid dysfunction for all modes of sex determination</a></h4>

              
                Haldane’s rule occupies a special place in biology as one of the few ‘rules’ of speciation, with empirical support from hundreds of species. And yet, its classic purview is restricted taxonomically to the subset of organisms with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. I propose explicit acknowledgement of generalized hypotheses about Haldane’s rule that frame sex bias in hybrid dysfunction broadly and irrespective of the sexual system. The consensus view of classic Haldane’s rule holds that sex-biased hybrid dysfunction across taxa is a composite phenomenon that requires explanations from multiple causes. Testing of the multiple alternative hypotheses for Haldane’s rule is, in many cases, applicable to taxa with homomorphic sex chromosomes, environmental sex determination, haplodiploidy, and hermaphroditism. Integration of a variety of biological phenomena about hybrids across diverse sexual systems, beyond classic Haldane’s rule, will help to derive a more general understanding of the contributing forces and mechanisms that lead to predictable sex biases in evolutionary divergence and speciation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96216">Artificially inserted strong promoter containing multiple G-quadruplexes induces long-range chromatin modification</a></h4>

              
                Although the role of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures has been suggested in chromosomal looping this was not tested directly. Here, to test causal function, an array of G4s, or control sequence that does not form G4s, were inserted within chromatin in cells. In vivo G4 formation of the inserted G4 sequence array, and not the control sequence, was confirmed using G4-selective antibody. Compared to the control insert, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of 3D chromatin looping interactions from the inserted G4 array. This was evident within the immediate topologically associated domain (TAD) and throughout the genome. Locally, recruitment of enhancer histone marks and the transcriptional coactivator p300/Acetylated-p300 increased in the G4-array, but not in the control insertion. Resulting promoter-enhancer interactions and gene activation were clear up to 5 Mb away from the insertion site. Together, these show the causal role of G4s in enhancer function and long-range chromatin interactions. Mechanisms of 3D topology are primarily based on DNA-bound architectural proteins that induce/stabilize long-range interactions. Involvement of the underlying intrinsic DNA sequence/structure in 3D looping shown here therefore throws new light on how long-range chromosomal interactions might be induced or maintained.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97027">Iron-sulfur cluster loss in mitochondrial CISD1 mediates PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila orthologue of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76940">Fam49b dampens TCR signal strength to regulate survival of positively selected thymocytes and peripheral T cells</a></h4>

              
                The fate of developing T cells is determined by the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signal they receive in the thymus. This process is finely regulated through the tuning of positive and negative regulators in thymocytes. The Family with sequence similarity 49 member B (Fam49b) protein is a newly discovered negative regulator of TCR signaling that has been shown to suppress Rac-1 activity in vitro in cultured T cell lines. However, the contribution of Fam49b to the thymic development of T cells is unknown. To investigate this important issue, we generated a novel mouse line deficient in Fam49b (Fam49b-KO). We observed that Fam49b-KO double positive (DP) thymocytes underwent excessive negative selection, whereas the positive selection stage was unaffected. Fam49b deficiency impaired the survival of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells. This altered development process resulted in significant reductions in CD4 and CD8 single-positive thymocytes as well as peripheral T cells. Interestingly, a large proportion of the TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> and CD8αα<sup>+</sup>TCRαβ<sup>+</sup> gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes were absent in Fam49b-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that Fam49b dampens thymocytes TCR signaling in order to escape negative selection during development, uncovering the function of Fam49b as a critical regulator of the selection process to ensure normal thymocyte development and peripheral T cells survival.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94109">Multiple guidance mechanisms control axon growth to generate precise T-shaped bifurcation during dorsal funiculus development in the spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal funiculus in the spinal cord relays somatosensory information to the brain. It is made of T-shaped bifurcation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory axons. Our previous study has shown that Slit signaling is required for proper guidance during bifurcation, but loss of Slit does not affect all DRG axons. Here, we examined the role of the extracellular molecule Netrin-1 (Ntn1). Using wholemount staining with tissue clearing, we showed that mice lacking Ntn1 had axons escaping from the dorsal funiculus at the time of bifurcation. Genetic labeling confirmed that these misprojecting axons come from DRG neurons. Single axon analysis showed that loss of Ntn1 did not affect bifurcation but rather altered turning angles. To distinguish their guidance functions, we examined mice with triple deletion of Ntn1, Slit1, and Slit2 and found a completely disorganized dorsal funiculus. Comparing mice with different genotypes using immunolabeling and single axon tracing revealed additive guidance errors, demonstrating the independent roles of Ntn1 and Slit. Moreover, the same defects were observed in embryos lacking their cognate receptors. These in vivo studies thus demonstrate the presence of multi-factorial guidance mechanisms that ensure proper formation of a common branched axonal structure during spinal cord development.

                The protein dynamical transition at ~200 K, where the biomolecule transforms from a harmonic, non-functional form to an anharmonic, functional state, has been thought to be slaved to the thermal activation of dynamics in its surface hydration water. Here, by selectively probing the dynamics of protein and hydration water using elastic neutron scattering and isotopic labeling, we found that the onset of anharmonicity in the two components around 200 K is decoupled. The one in protein is an intrinsic transition, whose characteristic temperature is independent of the instrumental resolution time, but varies with the biomolecular structure and the amount of hydration, while the one of water is merely a resolution effect.

">The multi-stage plasticity in the aggression circuit underlying the winner effect</a></h4>

              
                Winning increases the readiness to attack and the probability of winning, a widespread phenomenon known as the "winner effect". Here, we reveal a transition from target-specific to generalized aggression enhancement over 10 days of winning in male mice, which is supported by three stages of plasticity in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), a critical node for aggression. Over 10-day winning, VMHvl cells experience monotonic potentiation of long-range excitatory inputs, a transient local connectivity strengthening, and a delayed excitability increase. These plasticity events are causally linked. Optogenetically coactivating the posterior amygdala (PA) terminals and VMHvl cells potentiates the PA-VMHvl pathway and triggers the cascade of plasticity events as those during repeated winning. Optogenetically blocking PA-VMHvl synaptic potentiation eliminates all winning-induced plasticity. These results reveal the complex Hebbian synaptic and excitability plasticity in the aggression circuit during winning that ultimately leads to an increase in "aggressiveness" in repeated winners.

">Compressed higher-order structures facilitate human knowledge network learning</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge seeking is innate to human nature, yet integrating vast and fragmented information into a unified network is a daunting challenge, especially in the information explosion era. Graph theory describes knowledge as a network characterising relationships (edges) between isolated data (nodes). Accordingly, knowledge learning could be abstracted as network navigation through random walks, where local connections are gradually learned and integrated to form the global picture. To facilitate network learning, we develop a novel "compressive learning" approach that decomposes network structures into substructures based on higher-order inhomogeneity properties and designs pre-learning paths highlighting key substructures. Large-scale behavioural experiments and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings demonstrate its effectiveness and better network formation in human brains. Hypergraph-based computational models reveal that the pre-learning path helps establish the core network skeleton to efficiently accommodate late inputs. Overall, higher-order network structures are crucial to network learning and can be utilised to better "connect the dots".

">The developing hippocampus: Microstructural evolution through childhood and adolescence</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a structure in the medial temporal lobe which serves multiple cognitive functions. While important, the development of the hippocampus in the formative period of childhood and adolescence has not been extensively investigated, with most contemporary research focusing on macrostructural measures of volume. Thus, there has been little research on the development of the micron-scale structures (i.e., microstructure) of the hippocampus, which engender its cognitive functions. The current study examined age-related changes of hippocampal microstructure using diffusion MRI data acquired with an ultra-strong gradient (300 mT/m) MRI scanner in a sample of children and adolescents (N=88; 8-19 years). Surface-based hippocampal modelling was combined with established microstructural approaches, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion Density Imaging (NODDI), and a more advanced gray matter diffusion model Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI). No significant changes in macrostructural measures (volume, gyrification, and thickness) were found between 8-19 years, while significant changes in microstructure measures related to neurites (from NODDI and SANDI), soma (from SANDI), and mean diffusivity (from DTI) were found. In particular, there was a significant increase across age in neurite MR signal fraction and a significant decrease in extracellular MR signal fraction and mean diffusivity across the hippocampal subfields and long-axis. A significant negative correlation between age and MR apparent soma radius was found in the subiculum and CA1 throughout the anterior and body of the hippocampus. Further surface-based analyses uncovered variability in age-related microstructural changes between the subfields and long-axis, which may reflect ostensible developmental differences along these two axes. Finally, correlation of hippocampal surfaces representing age-related changes of microstructure with maps derived from histology allowed for postulation of the potential underlying microstructure that diffusion changes across age may be capturing. Overall, distinct neurite and soma developmental profiles in the human hippocampus during late childhood and adolescence are reported for the first time.

">Feminization of social play behavior depends on microglia</a></h4>

              
                Many sex differences in brain and behavior are established developmentally by the opposing processes of feminization and masculinization, which manifest following differential steroid hormone exposure in early life. The cellular mechanisms underlying masculinization are well-documented, a result of the fact that it is steroid-mediated and can be easily induced in newborn female rodents via exogenous steroid treatment. However, the study of feminization of particular brain regions has largely been relegated to being not masculinization given the absence of an identified initiating trigger. As a result, the mechanisms of this key developmental process remain elusive. Here we describe a novel role for microglia, the brains innate immune cell, in the feminization of the medial amygdala and a complex social behavior, juvenile play. In the developing amygdala, microglia promote proliferation of astrocytes equally in both sexes, with no apparent effect on rates of cell division, but support cell survival selectively in females through the trophic actions of Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF). We demonstrate that disrupting TNF signaling, either by depleting microglia or inhibiting the associated signaling pathways, prevents the feminization of astrocyte density and increases juvenile play levels to that seen in males. This data, combined with our previous finding that male-like patterns of astrocyte density are sculpted by developmental microglial phagocytosis, reveals that sexual differentiation of the medial amygdala involves opposing tensions between active masculinization and active feminization, both of which require microglia but are achieved via distinct processes.

">Molecular Visualization of Neuronal TDP43 Pathology In Situ</a></h4>

              
                Nuclear exclusion and cytoplasmic accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43 are characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Despite this, the origin and ultrastructure of cytosolic TDP43 deposits remain unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal RNA homeostasis can drive pathological TDP43 mislocalization, enhancing RNA misprocessing due to loss of nuclear TDP43 and engendering a cycle that ends in cell death. Here, we show that adding small monovalent oligonucleotides successfully recapitulates pathological TDP43 mislocalization and aggregation in iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons). By employing a multimodal in situ cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy pipeline, we examine how RNA influences the localization and aggregation of TDP43 in near-native conditions. We find that mislocalized TDP43 forms ordered fibrils within lysosomes and autophagosomes in iNeurons as well as in patient tissue, and provide the first high-resolution snapshots of TDP43 aggregates in situ. In so doing, we provide a cellular model for studying initial pathogenic events underlying ALS, FTLD, and related TDP43-proteinopathies.

">CA1 ensemble plasticity is coupled to context change and modulated by task familiarity</a></h4>

              
                When should plasticity mechanisms get recruited (stability-plasticity dilemma)? Environments change over time, re/entering a given context increases uncertainty and predicts the need for updating. The hippocampus (HPC) is key to tracking context change but also navigation relative to moving targets. CA1 ensembles expressing immediate-early genes (IEGs) are contextually specific, while the amount of IEG expression correlates with HPC-dependent task demands. However, task effects on the IEG-expressing ensembles per se remain unclear. In three experiments, we tested the effect of context change and HPC task demands on CA1 IEG+ ensembles in rats. Experiment 1 showed that the IEG+ (Arc, Homer1a RNA) ensemble size drops to baseline level during uninterrupted 30 min exploration, reflecting familiarization and decreasing uncertainty, unless context change is present; the ensemble sizes reflect both context identity and context change. Experiment 2 showed no evidence of task-specificity of IEG+ ensembles during highly HPC-dependent mobile robot avoidance nor HPC-independent stationary robot avoidance. Experiment 3 replicated the findings of Experiment 2 for c-Fos protein. Nonetheless, the data suggest that ensembles shrink with task mastery/familiarity and grow with novelty presented by the acquisition of behavioral extinction. Overall, our results shed light on the temporal dynamics, and the context and task control of CA1 IEG+ ensembles. The present results and the relevant literature suggest that context change resets the ensemble of IEG-expressing CA1 neurons and novelty delays the time-dependent ensemble shrinking.

">Uncovering immune characteristics of neurons in the context of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.

">Burst Estimation through Atomic Decomposition (BEAD): A Toolbox to find Oscillatory Bursts in Brain Signals</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that brain signals often show oscillatory bursts of short durations, which have been linked to various aspects of computation and behaviour. Traditional methods often use direct spectral estimators to estimate the power of brain signals in spectral and temporal domains, from which bursts are identified. However, direct spectral estimators are known to be noisy, such that even stable oscillations may appear bursty. We have previously shown that the Matching Pursuit (MP) algorithm, which uses a large overcomplete dictionary of basis functions (called "atoms") to decompose the signal directly in the time domain, partly addresses this concern and robustly finds long bursts in synthetic as well as real data. However, MP is a greedy algorithm that can give non-optimal solutions and requires a large sized dictionary. To address these concerns, we extended two other algorithms - orthogonal MP (OMP) and OMP using Multiscale Adaptive Gabor Expansion (OMP-MAGE), to perform burst duration estimation. We also develop a novel algorithm, called OMP using Gabor Expansion with Atom Reassignment (OMP-GEAR). These algorithms overcome some of the limitations of MP and can work with a significantly smaller dictionary size. We find that, in synthetic data, OMP, OMP-MAGE and OMP-GEAR converge faster than MP. Also, OMP-MAGE and OMP-GEAR outperform both MP and OMP when the dictionary size is small. Finally, OMP-GEAR outperforms OMP-MAGE when the bursts are overlapping. Importantly, the burst durations obtained using MP and OMP with a very large-sized dictionary are comparable to that obtained using OMP-MAGE with a much smaller-sized dictionary in real data obtained from two monkeys passively viewing static gratings which induced gamma bursts in the primary visual cortex. OMP-GEAR yields slightly smaller burst durations, but all the estimated burst durations are still significantly larger than the duration estimated using traditional methods. These results suggest that gamma bursts are longer than previously reported. Raw data from two monkeys, as well as codes for both traditional and new methods, are publicly available as part of this toolbox.

">Peripheral Blood Immune Cells from Individuals with Parkinson's Disease or Inflammatory Bowel Disease Share Deficits in Iron Storage and Transport that are Modulated by Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which dysregulated neuroimmune crosstalk and inflammatory relay via the gut-blood-brain axis have been implicated in PD pathogenesis. Although alterations in circulating inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with PD, no biomarkers have been identified that predict clinical progression or disease outcome. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, which involves perturbation of the underlying immune system, is an early and often-overlooked symptom that affects up to 80% of individuals living with PD. Interestingly, 50-70% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a GI condition that has been epidemiologically linked to PD, display chronic illness-induced anemia - which drives toxic accumulation of iron in the gut. Ferroptotic (or iron loaded) cells have small and dysmorphic mitochondria-suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of iron accumulation. In pro-inflammatory environments, iron accumulates in immune cells, suggesting a possible connection and/or synergy between iron dysregulation and immune cell dysfunction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) recapitulate certain PD-associated neuropathological and inflammatory signatures and can act as communicating messengers in the gut-brain axis. Additionally, this communication can be modulated by several environmental factors; specifically, our data further support existing literature demonstrating a role for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in modulating immune transcriptional states in inflamed individuals. A mechanism linking chronic gut inflammation to iron dysregulation and mitochondrial function within peripheral immune cells has yet to be identified in conferring risk for PD. To that end, we isolated PBMCs and simultaneously evaluated their directed transcriptome and bioenergetic status, to investigate if iron dysregulation and mitochondrial sensitization are linked in individuals living with PD or IBD because of chronic underlying remittent immune activation. We have identified shared features of peripheral inflammation and immunometabolism in individuals living with IBD or PD that may contribute to the epidemiological association reported between IBD and risk for PD.

">Trust or doubt? Neural resonance based on facial expressions in a deception game reflected by frontal EEG activities.</a></h4>

              
                The frontal cortex plays a critical role in the deception. While previous neuroimaging studies have examined the functions of various subregions within the frontal cortex, particularly in relation to truth inhibition and lie production, there is a limited understanding of frontal activities during deception in the context of social interaction. To bridge this gap, we investigated an EEG dataset collected during a deception game involving two participants (one player and one observer) who engaged in social interaction. In the game, the player was instructed or chose spontaneously whether to lie or tell the truth, while the observer decided whether to doubt or trust the player based on the player's facial expressions. Our analyses on the behavioral and EEG data revealed two major findings: (1) The observers' responses were directly impacted by the players' facial expressions. Without being informed about the trial conditions, the observer was more likely to doubt the player in instructed conditions compared to the spontaneous ones, a tendency that was evident in both the behavioral data and the observer's vlPFC activities. (2) Despite a performance at the chance level, the observer's responses seemed to depend on the player's neural activities. As evidence, both the observer's vlPFC and the player's dmPFC-vlPFC activities reflected the observer's responses (trust versus doubt). According to these results and previous research, we propose a neural resonance model driven by facial expressions from the player's emotional regulation system (dmPFC-vlPFC) to the observer's emotion perception system (vlPFC) during the deception game.

">The stretch-shortening cycle effect is not associated with cortical or spinal excitability modulations</a></h4>

              
                It is unclear whether cortical and spinal excitability modulations contribute to enhanced SSC performance. Therefore, this study investigated cortical and spinal excitability modulations during and following shortening of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) contractions compared with pure shortening (SHO) contractions. Participants (N = 18) performed submaximal voluntary plantar flexion contractions while prone on the dynamometer bench. The right foot was strapped onto the dynamometer footplate attachment and the resultant ankle joint torque and crank arm angle were recorded. Cortical and spinal excitability modulations of the soleus muscle were analyzed by eliciting compound muscle actional potentials via electrical nerve stimulation, cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) via electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) via magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex. Mean torque following stretch was significantly increased by 7 plus minus 3% (p=0.029) compared with the fixed-end reference (REF) contraction and mean torque during shortening of SSC compared with SHO was significantly increased by 12 plus minus 24% (p=0.046). Mean steady-state torque was significantly lower by 13 plus minus 3% (p=0.006) and 9 plus minus 12% (p=0.011) following SSC compared with REF and SHO, respectively. Mean steady-state torque was not significantly lower following SHO compared with REF (7 plus minus 8%, p=0.456). CMEPs and MEPs were also not significantly different during shortening of SSC compared with SHO or during the steady state of SSC, SHO, and REF. Therefore, our results indicate that SSC performance was not associated with cortical or spinal excitability modulations during or after shortening, but rather driven by mechanical mechanisms triggered during active stretch.

">Fast implicit and slow explicit learning of temporal context in cortico-cerebellar loops</a></h4>

              
                One is seldom aware of the anticipatory and preemptive feats that the eyeblink systems achieves in daily life but it frequently protects the eye from projectiles gone awry and insects on apparent collision courses. This poor awareness is why predictive eyeblinks are considered a form of implicit learning. In motor neuroscience, implicit learning is considered to be slow and, eyeblink conditioning, in particular, is believed to be a rigid and inflexible cerebellar-dependent behavior. In cognitive neuroscience, however, implicit and automatic processes are thought to be rapidly acquired. Here we show that the eyeblink system is, in fact, capable of remarkable cognitive flexibility and can learn on more rapid timescales than previously expected. In a task where we yoked contextual learning of predictive eyeblinks and manual responses in humans, well-timed eyeblink responses flexibly adjusted to external context on each trial. The temporal precision of the predictive eyeblinks exceeded that of manual response times. Learning of the well-timed eyeblink responses was also more rapid than that for the manual response times. This pattern persevered with the use of a cognitive strategy, which seemed to accelerate both types of learning. These results suggest that behaviors associated with the cerebellar cortex that were previously believed to be inflexible and largely implicit, can demonstrate rapid and precise context-dependent temporal control.

">Cerebellar encoding of prior knowledge of temporal statistics</a></h4>

              
                We possess the ability to anticipate and preempt occurrences under familiar circumstances, which suggests a reliance on prior experience with regularities in our environment, especially when observations become more uncertain. We know little about the neural mechanisms that can learn the probabilities of events in the environment and use this prior experience to guide actions. To examine this, we studied a rudimentary predictive behavior, eyeblink conditioning, and asked whether a simple effector like the eyelid could adapt its movements to varying probabilities of environmental events that reflect different degrees of uncertainty. We found that predictive eyeblink behavior systematically changed almost all its properties according to the temporal statistics of stimulus probability distributions. We also found that the activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells and putative molecular layer interneurons changed concomitantly with temporal statistics of the stimuli and with behavior. Targeted optogenetic perturbation of Purkinje cells during critical time windows severely attenuated the predictive behavior but left reflexive eyeblinks intact. Furthermore, we discovered a novel Purkinje cell complex spike signal coinciding with the onset of the earliest probable time interval in prior distributions with high uncertainty. This signal could not be explained as a motor or sensory correlate and appears to be anticipatory in nature. Theoretical modeling results pointed to a possible synaptic mechanism for how Purkinje cells could encode prior experience of environmental statistics in their activity through the juxtaposition of long-term depression and potentiation dynamics.

">Balancing Selectivity and Generality in Object Recognition through Structured Interconnectivity.</a></h4>

              
                Balancing selectivity and generality in object recognition is a significant challenge, as it requires the ability to discern fine details that set objects apart while simultaneously embracing the common threads that classify them into one single category. Here we investigated how the brain addresses this challenge by examining the relationship between the interconnectivity of neural networks, the dimensionality of neural space, and the balance of selectivity and generality using neurophysiological data and computational modeling. We found that higher interconnectivity in the TEa of macaques IT cortex was associated with lower dimensionality and increased generality, while lower interconnectivity in the TEO correlated with higher dimensionality and enhanced selectivity. To establish the causal link, we developed a brain-inspired computational model formed through Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules, with wiring length constraints derived from biological brains. The resulting structured interconnectivity created an optimal dimensionality of the neural space, allowing for efficient energy distribution across the representational manifold embedded in the neural space to balance selectivity and generality. Interestingly, this structured interconnectivity placed the network in a critical state that balances adaptability and stability, and fostered a cognitive module with cognitive impenetrability. In summary, our study underscores the importance of structured interconnectivity in achieving a balance between selectivity and generality, providing a unifying view of balancing two extreme demands in object recognition.

">A meta-analysis of sex differences in neonatal rodent ultrasonic vocalizations and the implication for the preclinical maternal immune activation model</a></h4>

              
                As the earliest measure of social communication in rodents, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in response to maternal separation are critical in preclinical research on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). While sex differences in both USV production and behavioral outcomes are reported, many studies overlook sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of NDDs. We aimed to evaluate sex differences in USV call parameters and to determine if USVs are differently impacted based on sex in the preclinical maternal immune activation (MIA) model. Results indicate that sex differences in USVs vary with developmental stage and are more pronounced in MIA offspring. Specifically, control females exhibited longer call durations than males in early development (up to postnatal day [PND] 8), but this pattern reverses after PND8. MIA leads to a reduction in call numbers for females compared to same-sex controls in early development, with a reversal post-PND8. MIA decreased call duration and increased total call duration in males, but unlike females, developmental stage did not influence these differences. In males, MIA effects varied by species, with decreased call numbers in rats but increased call numbers in mice. The timing of MIA (gestational day less than or equal to 12.5 vs. > 12.5) did not significantly affect the results. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex, developmental timing, and species in USVs research. We discuss how analyzing USV call types and incorporating sex as a biological variable can enhance our understanding of neonatal ultrasonic communication and its translational value in NDD research.

">Learning to use landmarks for navigation amplifies their representation in retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual landmarks provide powerful reference signals for efficient navigation by altering the activity of spatially tuned neurons, such as place cells, head direction cells, and grid cells. To understand the neural mechanism by which landmarks exert such strong influence, it is necessary to identify how these visual features gain spatial meaning. In this study, we characterized visual landmark representations in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) using chronic two-photon imaging of the same neuronal ensembles over the course of spatial learning. We found a pronounced increase in landmark-referenced activity in RSC neurons that, once established, remained stable across days. Changing behavioral context by uncoupling treadmill motion from visual feedback systematically altered neuronal responses associated with the coherence between visual scene flow speed and self-motion. To explore potential underlying mechanisms, we modeled how burst firing, mediated by supralinear somatodendritic interactions, could efficiently mediate context- and coherence-dependent integration of landmark information. Our results show that visual encoding shifts to landmark-referenced and context-dependent codes as these cues take on spatial meaning during learning.

">Neural Mechanisms of Feedback Processing and Behavioral Adaptation during Neurofeedback Training</a></h4>

              
                The acquisition of new skills can be facilitated by providing individuals with feedback that reflects their performance. This process creates a closed loop that utilizes feedback processing and behavioral adaptation following feedback to promote effective training. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback is a specific instantiation of this principle, where the brain is trained directly by providing feedback of its self-regulation. Neurofeedback is unique in that it is the most direct form of brain training and it trains something we do not normally have conscious access to - our brain activity. To understand how learning with neurofeedback or other forms of feedback is accomplished, it is essential to understand how the feedback is evaluated and how behavior is adjusted following guidance from the feedback signal. In this pre-registered mega-analysis, we re-analyzed data from eight intermittent fMRI neurofeedback studies (N = 153 individuals) to investigate brain regions whose activity and connectivity are associated with feedback processing and behavioral adaptation to feedback during neurofeedback training. We converted and harmonized feedback scores across studies, and computed their linear associations with brain activity and connectivity in parametric general linear model analyses. We observed that, during feedback processing, feedback scores were positively associated with (1) activity in key regions of the reward system, as well as the dorsal attention network, default mode network, and cerebellum; and with (2) reward system-related connectivity in the salience network. During behavioral adaptation (i.e., regulation after feedback), no significant associations were observed between feedback scores and either activity or associative learning-related connectivity. Our results demonstrate that neurofeedback is processed in the reward system, thereby endorsing the theory that reinforcement learning shapes this form of brain training towards behavioral change. In addition, the association of large-scale networks with feedback suggests that higher-level processing, involving the continuous transition between the evaluation of external feedback and the subsequent internal evaluation of the adopted cognitive state, is also involved in this type of learning. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of performance-related feedback as a driving force during learning, a conclusion that can potentially be extended to other processes beyond neurofeedback training.

">Attention and working memory investigated through the P300 component in children practicing Karate at different stages of biological maturation</a></h4>

              
                Aim: To investigate attention and working memory, comparing children practice Karate and non-Karate practitioners at different stages of biological maturation through the amplitude and latency of the P300 component during the execution of a Go/No-Go paradigm. Material and Methods: The P300 was analyzed for Fz, Cz, and Pz electrodes in 80 participants separated in two groups: an Karate practitioners group comprising Karate practitioners and comprising non-Karate practitioners. Each group was further subdivided according to the biological maturation range defined by Peak Height Velocity. In addition, the participants performed a Go/No-Go paradigm to measure amplitude and latency. Results: The EEG analysis showed Ffr electrodes Pz and Cz, an interaction was found between group and Peak Height Velocity for the amplitude variable (respectively: F = 45.858; d = 0.38; p < 0.001 / F = 10.411; d = 0.17; p = 0.004). For the Fz electrode, a main effect was found between group and Peak Height Velocity (respectively: F = 40.330; d = 0.34; p = 0.010 / F = 36.730; d = 0.30; p = 0.012) for the variable amplitude and latency. main effect between group and Peak Height Velocity (respectively: F = 7.719; d = 0.14; p = 0.012 / F = 38.370; d = 0.31; p = 0.010). Conclusions: In general, it is possible to conclude that participants in the Karate practitioners group exhibited electrocortical measures corresponding to greater efficiency in decision-making and attention processes, motor planning, working memory, attention allocation, motor execution, and greater attentional engagement. It was also demonstrated that, despite the children being at very close chronological ages, their biological maturation differed.

">Awe is characterized as an ambivalent experience in the human behavior and cortex: integrated virtual reality-electroencephalogram study</a></h4>

              
                Understanding complex emotions, characterized by the co-occurrence of positive and negative feelings, is crucial for unlocking the full spectrum of human affective experiences. However, the behavior and neural representation of ambivalent feelings, particularly during awe, remain elusive. To address this gap, we combined awe-inducing virtual reality clips, electroencephalogram, and a deep learning-based dimensionality reduction technique (N = 43). Behaviorally, awe ratings were precisely predicted by the duration and intensity of ambivalent feelings, not by single valence metrics. In the electrophysiological analysis, we identified participant- and clip-specific latent neural spaces sharing valence representation structures across individuals and stimuli. In these spaces, ambivalent feelings during awe were distinctly represented, and the variability in their distinctiveness specifically predicted awe ratings. Additionally, frontal delta oscillations mainly engaged in differentiating valence representations. Our findings demonstrate that awe is fundamentally an ambivalent experience reflected in both behavior and distinct patterns of electrophysiological activity. This work provides a new framework for understanding complex emotions and their neural underpinnings, with potential implications for affective neuroscience and mental health research.

">Network influence determines the impact of cortical ensembles on stimulus detection</a></h4>

              
                Observation of neural firing patterns can constrain theories for the types of activity patterns that the brain uses to guide behavior. However, directly perturbing these patterns, ideally with great specificity, is required to causally test any particular theory. We combined two-photon imaging and cellular resolution optogenetic photo-stimulation to causally test how neural activity in the mouse visual cortex is read out to detect visual stimuli. Contrary to expectations, targeted activation of highly sensitive neural ensembles did not preferentially modify behavior compared to random ensembles, contradicting a longstanding hypothesis for how neural activity drives stimulus detection. Instead, the main predictor of a targeted neural ensemble's impact on perception was its effect on network activity. This argues that downstream regions summate visual cortex activity without preferentially weighting more informative neurons to make sensory detection decisions. Comparing mouse behavioral performance to decoding models of neural activity implies that mice employ this simple, albeit suboptimal strategy to solve the task. This work challenges conventional notions for how sensory representations mediate perception and demonstrates that specific neural perturbations are critical for determining which features of neural activity drive behavior.

">Connectivity of the neuronal network for contextual fear memory is disrupted in a mouse model of third-trimester binge-like ethanol exposure</a></h4>

              
                Background: In rodents, third-trimester equivalent alcohol exposure (TTAE) produces significant deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory processes such as contextual fear conditioning (CFC). The present study sought to characterize changes in both behavior and Fos+ neurons following CFC in ethanol (EtOH)-treated versus saline-treated mice using TRAP2:Ai14 mice that permanently label Fos+ neurons following a tamoxifen injection. We hypothesized that TTAE would produce long-lasting disruptions to the networks engaged following CFC with a particular emphasis on the limbic memory system. Methods: On postnatal day 7, mice received either two injections of saline or 2.5 g/kg EtOH spaced 2 hours apart. The mice were left undisturbed until they reached adulthood, at which point they underwent CFC. After context exposure on day 2, mice received a tamoxifen injection. Brain tissue was harvested. Slides were automatically imaged using a Zeiss AxioScanner. Manual counts on a priori regions of interest were conducted. Automated counts were performed on the whole brain using the QUINT 2D stitching pipeline. Last, novel network analyses were applied to identify future regions of interest. Results: TTAE reduced context recall on day 2 of CFC. Fos+ neural density increased in the CA1 and CA3. Fos+ counts were reduced in the anteroventral (AV) and anterodorsal thalamus. The limbic memory system showed significant hyperconnectivity in male TTAE mice and the AV shifted affinity towards hippocampal subregions. Last, novel regions such as a subparafascicular area and basomedial amygdalar nucleus were implicated as important mediators. Discussion: These results suggest that CFC is mediated by the limbic memory system and is disrupted following TTAE. Given the increase in CA1 and CA3 activity, a potential hypothesis is that TTAE causes disruptions to memory encoding following day 1 conditioning. Future studies will aim to determine whether this disruption specifically affects the encoding or retrieval of fear memories.

">ROLE OF WORKING MEMORY IN INTERLIMB GENERALIZATION OF NEWLY LEARNED SKILLS</a></h4>

              
                Newly acquired skill memory can generalize/transfer to the untrained arm. Such interlimb generalization of a learned skill has been shown to be symmetric in nature and is thought to be mediated by cognitive processes that emerge during skill learning. However, it is unknown whether engaging in other cognitively demanding tasks following skill acquisition can influence skill generalization. Our research goal was to uncover how a secondary task, involving working memory, interacts with a newly formed skill memory and influences subsequent interlimb generalization. To test this idea, we conducted a set of three experiments by recruiting right-handed young healthy individuals (N=92) who learned a novel motor skill (long or short training on a skilled reaching task) followed by performing a working memory or control task with the right arm. Finally, all individuals were tested for immediate or delayed (after 24 hours) interlimb skill generalization to the untrained left arm. We found significant immediate as well as delayed generalization in individuals who received long training on the motor skill task, irrespective of whether they performed working memory or control task. On the other hand, performing the working memory but not control task following short skill training impaired generalization when the untrained arm was tested 24 hours later. These findings indicate that short training reflecting early stages of skill learning and the subsequent skill memory stabilization are dependent on working memory such that the underlying neural interactions mediating these processes can have implications for skill generalization.

">ClearScope: a fully integrated light sheet theta microscope for sub-cellular resolution imaging without lateral size constraints</a></h4>

              
                Three-dimensional (3D) ex vivo imaging of cleared intact brains of animal models and large human and non-human primate postmortem brain specimens is important for understanding the physiological neural network connectivity patterns and the pathological alterations underlying neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Light-sheet microscopy has emerged as a highly effective imaging modality for rapid high-resolution imaging of large cleared samples. However, the orthogonal arrangements of illumination and detection optics in light sheet microscopy limits the size of specimen that can be imaged. Recently developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM) technology addressed this by utilizing a unique arrangement of two illumination light paths oblique to the detection light path, while allowing perpendicular arrangement of the detection light path relative to the specimen surface. Here, we report development of a next-generation, fully integrated, and user-friendly LSTM system for rapid sub-cellular resolution imaging uniformly throughout a large specimen without constraining the lateral (XY) size. In addition, we provide a seamlessly integrated workflow for image acquisition, data storage, pre- and post-processing, enhancement, and quantitative analysis. We demonstrate the system performance by high-resolution 3D imaging of intact mouse brains and human brain samples, and complete data analysis including digital neuron tracing, vessel reconstruction and design-based stereological analysis in 3D. This technically enhanced and user-friendly LSTM implementation will enable rapid quantitative mapping of molecular and cellular features of interests in diverse types of very large samples.

">Engagement in moderate-intensity physical activity supports overnight emotional memory retention in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Preserving the ability to vividly recall emotionally rich experiences contributes to quality of life in older adulthood. While prior work suggests that moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) may bolster memory, it is unclear whether this extends to emotionally salient memories consolidated during sleep. Objective: To investigate associations between engagement in physical activity (PA) and overnight emotional memory retention and examine whether theoretically replacing 30-minutes of lower-intensity activity with MPA is associated with better consolidation. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional study of 40 community-dwelling older adults free of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Data were collected from May 2018 to July 2022 and analyzed from January to July 2024. Exposures: Participants completed an overnight polysomnography (PSG) with emotional memory tested before and after sleep and a self-report questionnaire assessing habitual PA. Main Outcome(s) and Measures(s): Emotional memory performance was assessed via recognition memory or mnemonic discrimination performance. Overnight memory retention was calculated by subtracting immediate test from delayed test performance for both recognition memory and mnemonic discrimination, with more negative scores indicating lower memory retention. Frequency and duration of MPA, light-intensity PA, non-exertive activity, and sedentary behavior were calculated from the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) Activities Questionnaire for Older Adults. Isotemporal substitution modelling evaluated whether statistically reallocating time spent in sedentary and lower-intensity activity to MPA was associated with better overnight memory retention. Results: Data from 40 participants were analyzed (mean age=72.3, 26 female). Better overnight emotional recognition memory retention was associated with the frequency ({beta}=0.663, SE=0.212, p=0.003) and duration ({beta}=0.214, SE=0.101, p=0.042) of MPA. No relationships were found with mnemonic discrimination or neutral recognition memory. Statistically modelling the replacement of 30 minutes of lower-intensity activity with MPA was associated with better overnight retention of emotional memories ({beta}=0.108, SE=0.048, p=0.030), but not neutral ({beta}=-0.029, SE=0.069, p=0.679). Conclusions and Relevance: MPA may enhance sleep-dependent consolidation of emotional memories in older adults. Modest increases in MPA may yield significant benefits for sleep-dependent emotional memory retention. These findings may guide interventions to preserve memory function and inform public health recommendations by demonstrating that substituting even short durations of low-intensity activity for MPA could produce significant cognitive gains relevant for maintaining quality of life in older adulthood.

">A virtual clinical trial of psychedelics to treat patients with disorders of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Disorders of consciousness (DoC), including the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and the minimally conscious state (MCS), have limited treatment options. Recent research suggests that psychedelic drugs, known for their complexity-enhancing properties, could be promising treatments for DoC. This study uses whole-brain computational models to explore this potential. We created individualised models for DoC patients, optimised with empirical fMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data, and simulated the administration of LSD and psilocybin. We used an in-silico perturbation protocol to distinguish between different states of consciousness, including DoC, anaesthesia, and the psychedelic state, and assess the dynamical stability of the brains of DoC patients pre- and post-psychedelic simulation. Our findings indicate that LSD and psilocybin shift DoC patients' brains closer to criticality, with a greater effect in MCS patients. In UWS patients, the treatment response correlates with structural connectivity, while in MCS patients, it aligns with baseline functional connectivity. This virtual clinical trial lays a computational foundation for using psychedelics in DoC treatment and highlights the future role of computational modelling in drug discovery and personalised medicine.

">Benchmarking macaque gene expression for horizontal and vertical translation</a></h4>

              
                The spatial patterning of gene expression shapes cortical organization and emergent function. Advances in spatial transcriptomics make it possible to comprehensively map cortical gene expression in both humans and model organisms. The macaque is a particularly valuable model organism, due to its evolutionary similarity with the human. The translational potential of macaque gene expression rests on the assumption that it is a good proxy for spatial patterns of corresponding proteins (vertical translation) and for spatial patterns of ortholog human genes (horizontal translation). Here we systematically benchmark the spatial distribution of gene expression in the macaque cortex against (a) cortical receptor density in the macaque and (b) cortical gene expression in the human. We find that there is moderate cortex-wide correspondence between gene expression and protein density in the macaque, which is improved by considering layer specific gene expression. We find greater correspondence between orthologous gene expression in the macaque and human. Inter-species correspondence of gene expression exhibits systematic regional heterogeneity, with greater correspondence in unimodal than transmodal cortex, mapping onto patterns of evolutionary cortical expansion. We extend these results to additional micro-architectural features using macaque immunohistochemistry and T1w:T2w ratio, and replicate them using macaque RNA-seq and human RNA-seq gene expression. Collectively, the present results showcase both the potential and limitations of macaque spatial transcriptomics as an engine of translational discovery within and across species.

                Cryoanesthesia-a purely physical anesthesia treatment that freezes tissue and attenuate nerve activity-can provide fast treatment through freezing and thawing of cryo-machine and is inexpensive compared to other anesthetics. However, cryoanesthesia has not been widely adopted because securing safe and effective conditions requires quantitative measurement and analysis of neuronal signaling during freezing and recovery, for which research tools are limited. A lack of rapid and localized cooling technologies for quantitative cellular level analysis, in particular, hinders research on not only the optimal cryo-modulation of neuronal activities but also its influence to neighboring cells via cellular networks. Here, we introduce a novel cryo-neuromodulation platform, a high-speed precision probe-type cooling device (~20 C/s at cooling) that provides localized cooling combined with a microelectrode array (MEA) system. We explored the temperature conditions for efficient silencing and recovery of neuronal activities without cell damage. We found that electrical activities of neurons were fully recovered within 1 minute of cooling duration with the maximum cooling speed, which was also confirmed with calcium imaging. The impact of silenced neurons on the neighboring neural network was explored using the localized cooling and we perceived that its influence can be transmitted if the neuronal network is well organized. Our new cryo-device provides rapid and reversible control of neural activities, which allows not just quantitative analysis of the network dynamics, but also new applications in clinical settings.

">Behavioral and Eye-Tracking Evidence for Disrupted Event Segmentation during Continuous Memory Encoding Due to Short Video Watching</a></h4>

              
                The widespread use of short-video platforms (e.g., TikTok), with over one billion monthly active users worldwide in 2023, necessitates an examination of their effects on cognitive functions. We hypothesized that because of the frequent, user-driven shifts in content during short-video watching, it mainly impairs event segmentation, a critical cognitive process in continuous perception and memory formation. To investigate this, we integrated memory encoding-retrieval tasks, eye-tracking technology, self-report questionnaires, and advanced machine learning analyses of eye movements. Our experiments (Study1 N=113, Study2 N=60), which varied the types of videos (random vs. personalized) and memory stimuli (continuous movies vs. static images), demonstrated that watching randomly selected short videos, particularly when integrated into daily viewing patterns, detrimentally affects memory encoding, especially in the initial and middle phases of continuous memory encoding. However, this impairment was not evident in trial-based image encoding tasks, suggesting a selective disruption in continuous memory processes. Intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis of eye movements revealed decreased synchronization at event boundaries during movie watching after exposure to random short videos. Furthermore, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analyses indicated that participants were more likely to experience fragmented event segmentation during continuous memory encoding following exposure to random short videos. These findings underscore the potentially harmful impact of short-video watching on event segmentation and memory formation, emphasizing the role of recommendation algorithms in modulating human cognition.

">Platelet-derived LPA16:0 inhibits adult neurogenesis and stress resilience in anxiety disorder</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety disorders are accompanied by changes in brain plasticity, stress vulnerability and heightened risk of depression. Here, we found that serum LPA16:0 abundance increased with trait anxiety in both human and mice and was sufficient to reduce the proliferation of adult hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells. In humans, the main LPA receptor, LPA1, bears single nucleotide polymorphism variants associated with anxiety. In mice, LPA16:0 decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and stress resilience, whereas LPA1 antagonism or the reduction of platelets, the main source of circulating LPA16:0, increased adult neurogenesis and resilience to acute stress. Finally, the inhibition of adult neurogenesis abolished the beneficial effect of LPA1 antagonism on resilience against both acute and chronic stress. Together, these findings identify LPA16:0-LPA1 signaling as a regulation mechanism of adult neurogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for mood disorders.

">Biological sex and BMI influence the longitudinal evolution of adolescent and young adult MRI-visible perivascular spaces</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: An association recently emerged between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible perivascular spaces (MV-PVS) with intracerebral solute clearance and neuroinflammation, in adults. However, it is unknown how MV-PVS change throughout adolescence and what factors influence MV-PVS volume and morphology. This study assesses the temporal evolution of MV-PVS volume in adolescents and young adults, and secondarily evaluates the relationship between MV-PVS, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods: This analysis included a 783 participant cohort from the longitudinal multicenter National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence study that involved up to 6 imaging visits spanning 5 years. Healthy adolescents aged 12-21 years at study entry with at least two MRI scans were included. The primary outcome was mean MV-PVS volume (mm3/white matter cm3). Results: On average, males had greater MV-PVS volume at all ages compared to females. A linear mixed-effect model for MV-PVS volume was performed. Mean BMI and increases in a person's BMI were associated with increases in MV-PVS volume over time. In females only, changes in BMI correlated with MV-PVS volume. One unit increase in BMI above a person's average BMI was associated with a 0.021 mm3/cm3 increase in MV-PVS volume (p<0.001). Conclusion: This longitudinal study showed sex differences in MV-PVS features during adolescence and young adulthood. Importantly, we report that increases in BMI from a person's mean BMI are associated with increases in MV-PVS volume in females only. These findings suggest a potential link between MV-PVS, sex, and BMI that warrants future study.

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of overground robot exoskeleton gait training on gait outcomes, balance, and motor function in patients with stroke. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, literature searches were performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Ovid-LWW, and RISS databases. A total of 504 articles were identified, of which 19 were included for analysis after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The included literature was qualitatively evaluated using the PEDro scale, while the Egger&amp;amp;rsquo;s regression, funnel plot, and trim-and-fill methods were applied to assess and adjust for publication bias. Results: The averaged PEDro score was 6.21 points, indicating a high level of methodological quality. In the analysis based on dependent variables, higher effect sizes were observed in the following ascending order: gait speed (g = 0.26), motor function (g = 0.21), gait ability (g = 0.18), Timed Up and Go Test (g = &amp;amp;minus;0.15), gait endurance (g = 0.11), and Berg Balance Scale (g = 0.05). Subgroup analyses further revealed significant differences in Asian populations (g = 0.26), sessions lasting longer than 30 min (g = 0.37), training frequency of three times per week or less (g = 0.38), and training duration of four weeks or less (g = 0.25). Overall, the results of this study indicate that overground robot exoskeleton gait training is effective at improving gait speed in patients with stroke, particularly when the sessions exceed 30 min, are conducted three times or less per week, and last for four weeks or less. Conclusion: our results suggest that training is an effective intervention for patients with stroke, provided that appropriate goal-setting and intensity and overground robot exoskeleton gait are applied.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have validated a close association between inflammatory factors and multiple sclerosis (MS), but their causal relationship is not fully profiled yet. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal effect of circulating inflammatory proteins on MS. Data from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) were analyzed using a two-sample MR method to explore the relationship between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and MS. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the main method for evaluating exposures and outcomes. Furthermore, series of the methods of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used to fortify the final results. The results of the IVW method were corrected with Bonferroni (bon) and false discovery rate (fdr) for validating the robustness of results and ensuring the absence of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. The sensitivity analysis was also performed. The results of the forward MR analysis showed that higher levels of CCL25 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS according to IVW results, OR: 1.085, 95% CI (1.011, 1.165), p = 2.42 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Similarly, higher levels of CXCL10 were found to be associated with an increased risk of MS, OR: 1.231, 95% CI (1.057, 1.433), p = 7.49 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;3, adjusted p_adj_bon = 0.682, p_adj_fdr = 0.227. In contrast, elevated levels of neurturin (NRTN) were associated with a decreased risk of MS, OR: 0.815, 95% CI (0.689, 0.964), p = 1.68 &amp;amp;times; 10&amp;amp;minus;2, adjusted p_adj_bon = 1, p_adj_fdr = 0.307. Reverse MR analysis showed no causal relationship between MS and the identified circulating inflammatory cytokines. The effects of heterogeneity and level pleiotropy were further excluded by sensitivity analysis. This study provides new insights into the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and MS and brings up a new possibility of using these cytokines as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The data in this study show that there are only weak associations between inflammatory molecules and MS risk, which did not survive bon and fdr correction, and the obtained p-values are quite low. Therefore, further studies on larger samples are needed.</p>

	<p>Motor imagery (MI) requires the mental representation of the body, obtained by integrating exteroceptive and interoceptive information. This study aimed to investigate the role of interoceptive sensitivity (IS) in MI performed through visual and kinesthetic modalities by participants with low (lows, N = 26; SHSS: A, M + SD: 1.00 + 1.52), medium (mediums, N = 11; SHSS: A, 6.00 + 0.77) and high hypnotizability scores (highs, N = 16; SHSS:A, 9.75 + 1.24), as measured by the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form A. The three groups displayed different MI abilities and IS levels. The efficacy of MI was measured using the chronometric index and self-reported experience, while IS was measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. Alpha and beta power spectrum densities (PSDs) were extracted from the EEG signals acquired during baseline, actual movement and visually and kinesthetically imagined movements. The chronometric indices do not reveal significant differences between groups and imagery modalities. The self-report MI efficacy indicates better kinesthetic imagery in highs and mediums than in lows, and no modality difference among lows. The MAIA dimensions sustain the differences in subjective experience and almost all the EEG differences. The latter are slightly different in highs, mediums and lows. This is the first report of the major role played by IS in MI and strongly supports the theory of embodied cognition.</p>

	<p>Long COVID (Coronavirus disease), affecting millions globally, presents unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems due to its complex, multifaceted nature and the lack of effective treatments. This perspective review explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-guided transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an innovative approach to address the urgent need for effective Long COVID management. The authors examine how AI could optimize tDCS protocols, enhance clinical trial design, and facilitate personalized treatment for the heterogeneous manifestations of Long COVID. Key areas discussed include AI-driven personalization of tDCS parameters based on individual patient characteristics and real-time symptom fluctuations, the use of machine learning for patient stratification, and the development of more sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials. This perspective addresses ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access to AI-enhanced treatments. It also explores challenges and opportunities for implementing AI-guided tDCS across diverse healthcare settings globally. Future research directions are outlined, including the need for large-scale validation studies and investigations of long-term efficacy and safety. The authors argue that while AI-guided tDCS shows promise for addressing the complex nature of Long COVID, significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges remain. They emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, patient-centered approaches, and a commitment to global health equity in realizing the potential of this technology. This perspective article provides a roadmap for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers involved in developing and implementing AI-guided neuromodulation therapies for Long COVID and potentially other neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p>

	<p>Calcium imaging, especially two-photon imaging, has become essential in neuroscience for studying neuronal and astrocytic activity under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Current advances in the development of calcium sensors as well as imaging hardware enable high-frequency measurements of calcium signals in hundreds of cells simultaneously. The analysis of these large datasets requires special tools and usually a certain level of programming experience. Despite advancements in calcium imaging analysis software development, significant gaps remain, particularly for data acquired at a high sampling rate that would allow for the spectral analysis of calcium signals. The FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox addresses these gaps by offering a comprehensive solution for analyzing simultaneously measured calcium imaging and electrophysiological data. It features both GUI-based and command-line approaches, emphasizing frequency domain analysis to reveal network-level oscillatory signals linked to single-cell activity. In addition, the toolbox puts special emphasis on differentiating between astrocytes and neurons, revealing the interactions between the network activity of the two major cell types of the brain. It facilitates a streamlined workflow for data loading, ROI identification, cell classification, fluorescence intensity calculation, spectral analysis, and report generation, supporting both manual and automated high-throughput analysis. This versatile platform enables the comprehensive analysis of large imaging datasets. In conclusion, the FluoAnalysis MATLAB toolbox provides a robust and versatile platform for the integrated analysis of calcium imaging and electrophysiological data, supporting diverse neuroscience research applications.</p>

                Interfering with cell metabolism is a strategy to inhibit tumor growth, but it may also impact T cells that are key for anti-tumor immunity. Gubser et al. define GLS1 as a target that does not affect T cell responses against cancer. In contrast, LDHA is essential for the anti-tumor activity of T cells.

	<p>Current pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are often only partially effective, with many patients experiencing no significant benefit, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, a classical serotonergic psychedelic, has emerged as a notable emerging treatment for such disorders. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize and discuss the most recent evidence about the therapeutic effects of single-dose and two-dose psilocybin administration on the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as compare the efficacy of these interventions among patients with a primary diagnosis of MDD or TRD. Articles were collected from EBSCOhost and PubMed following the PRISMA guidelines, yielding 425 articles with 138 duplicates. After screening 287 records, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. A quantitative analysis of the studies indicates that psilocybin is highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms severity among patients with primary MDD or TRD. Both single-dose and two-dose psilocybin treatments significantly reduced depressive symptoms severity, with two-dose administration sometimes yielding more pronounced and lasting effects. However, it is unclear if this was solely due to dosage or other factors. Future research should include standardized trials comparing these dosing strategies to better inform clinical practice.</p>

<br/>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

                In a study exploring the intricate relationship between PDAC matrix stiffness and the Warburg effect, Zheng et al. reveal CLIC1 as a critical mediator. Matrix stiffness increases CLIC1 levels through the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF4 pathway, correlating with adverse outcomes and tumor progression. Reducing matrix stiffness may offer therapeutic benefits by targeting CLIC1.

	<p>(1) Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) utilizing multi-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (ME-GE-EPI) has demonstrated higher sensitivity and stability compared to utilizing single-echo gradient echo-planar imaging (SE-GE-EPI). The direct derivation of T2* maps from fitting multi-echo data enables accurate recording of dynamic functional changes in the brain, exhibiting higher sensitivity than echo combination maps. However, the widely employed voxel-wise log-linear fitting is susceptible to inevitable noise accumulation during image acquisition. (2) Methods: This work introduced a synthetic data-driven deep learning (SD-DL) method to obtain T2* maps for multi-echo (ME) fMRI analysis. (3) Results: The experimental results showed the efficient enhancement of the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), improved task-based blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) percentage signal change, and enhanced performance in multi-echo independent component analysis (MEICA) using the proposed method. (4) Conclusion: T2* maps derived from ME-fMRI data using the proposed SD-DL method exhibit enhanced BOLD sensitivity in comparison to T2* maps derived from the LLF method.</p>

	<p>In recent years, sports-related concussion (SRC) in soccer has been extensively researched worldwide. However, there have been no reports of large-scale SRC studies among soccer players in Japan. The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of SRC among university soccer players in Japan. This descriptive epidemiological study collected data on the history of SRC and details of SRC injuries during soccer. The participants were university male soccer players belonging to the Japan University Football Association. SRC rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). A total of 5953 students participated in this study. The SRC rate was 0.10/1000 AE during total activities. The SRC rate during competition (0.42/1000 AE) was higher than in practice (0.04/1000 AE). The most frequent mechanism of SRC was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (26.9%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (24.2%). During competition, the most frequent mechanism was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (30.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (19.3%) followed, while in practice, it was &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ball&amp;amp;rdquo; (34.8%), followed by &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-ground&amp;amp;rdquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;ldquo;head-to-head&amp;amp;rdquo; (17.2%). Thus, there was a difference in the mechanism of injury between competition and practice. In this study, among Japanese university soccer players, the SRC rate was to be approximately ten times higher in competition than in practice.</p>

	<p>The current descriptive study reports the sleep, diet, and exercise patterns among 114 dementia caregivers, whose mean age was 55.7 (SD: 10.4) years, with 83 (72.8%) being women. The results indicate significant sleep dysfunction: 37.2% of caregivers reported rarely or never feeling rested upon waking, and 46.5% did not get enough sleep, with 45.6% sleeping only 5 to 5.5 h on average. Sleep latency was also prevalent, as 33.3% required 16 to 30 min to fall asleep. Dietary habits showed reliance on coffee, with 69.4% consuming it daily. Meat consumption was reported by 75%, and 60.9% ate pasta, indicating common dietary preferences. While 86.2% had one to three meals per day, 100% of the caregivers supplemented their diets with vitamins. The physical activity level was low, with 62.3% of respondents reporting no exercise in the past week. These findings underscore significant health concerns among dementia caregivers, including sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and physical inactivity. The report emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to promote self-care practices that can enhance caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; health, including better sleep hygiene, balanced nutrition, and regular exercise.</p>

	<p>Fatigue is one of the most frequent complaints of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), one of the 30 available fatigue questionnaires, is commonly applied because it evaluates multidimensional aspects of fatigue. The chief objectives of this study were to validate FIS and evaluate the psychometric properties of MS patients in Serbia. One hundred and twenty-one (121) MS patients and one hundred and twenty-two (122) age-, gender- and education-matched healthy control (HC) subjects completed the FIS and the Beck Depression Inventory. Internal consistency of the FIS subscales was determined using Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha Coefficient. Test/retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for each FIS subscale was performed. The total FIS score and subscale scores showed statistically significant differences between the MS patients and the HC subjects in both FIS sessions. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s Alpha was 0.966. All ICCs were statistically significant (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The Serbian version of this instrument may be useful as a clinical measure for fatigue and functionality in patients with MS.</p>

                <p>by Catherine M Byrne, Ana Citlali Márquez, Bing Cai, Daniel Coombs, Soren Gantt</p>

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection. Several HCMV vaccines are in development, but none have yet been approved. An understanding of the kinetics of CMV replication and transmission may inform the rational design of vaccines to prevent this infection. The salivary glands (SG) are an important site of sustained CMV replication following primary infection and during viral reactivation from latency. As such, the strength of the immune response in the SG likely influences viral dissemination within and between hosts. To study the relationship between the immune response and viral replication in the SG, and viral dissemination from the SG to other tissues, mice were infected with low doses of murine CMV (MCMV). Following intra-SG inoculation, we characterized the viral and immunological dynamics in the SG, blood, and spleen, and identified organ-specific immune correlates of protection. Using these data, we constructed compartmental mathematical models of MCMV infection. Model fitting to data and analysis indicate the importance of cellular immune responses in different organs and point to a threshold of infection within the SG necessary for the establishment and spread of infection.

                <p>by Ao Liu, Andrea Mair, Juliana L. Matos, Macy Vollbrecht, Shou-Ling Xu, Dominique C. Bergmann</p>

The development of multicellular organisms requires coordinated changes in gene expression that are often mediated by the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (CREs). During development and differentiation, the accessibility of CREs is dynamically modulated by the epigenome. How the epigenome, CREs, and TFs together exert control over cell fate commitment remains to be fully understood. In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf epidermis, meristemoids undergo a series of stereotyped cell divisions, then switch fate to commit to stomatal differentiation. Newly created or reanalyzed scRNA-seq and ChIP-seq data confirm that stomatal development involves distinctive phases of transcriptional regulation and that differentially regulated genes are bound by the stomatal basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) TFs. Targets of the bHLHs often reside in repressive chromatin before activation. MNase-seq evidence further suggests that the repressive state can be overcome and remodeled upon activation by specific stomatal bHLHs. We propose that chromatin remodeling is mediated through the recruitment of a set of physical interactors that we identified through proximity labeling—the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex and the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. The bHLHs and chromatin remodelers localize to overlapping genomic regions in a hierarchical order. Furthermore, plants with stage-specific knockdown of the SWI/SNF components or HAC1 fail to activate specific bHLH targets and display stomatal development defects. Together, these data converge on a model for how stomatal TFs and epigenetic machinery cooperatively regulate transcription and chromatin remodeling during progressive fate specification.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23621?af=R">17β‐Estradiol reduces inhibitory synaptic currents in entorhinal cortex neurons through G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23622?af=R">Cholinergic and behavior‐dependent beta and gamma waves are coupled between olfactory bulb and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory oscillations may enhance cognitive processing through coupling with beta (β, 15–30 Hz) and gamma (γ, 30–160 Hz) activity in the hippocampus (HPC). We hypothesize that coupling between olfactory bulb (OB) and HPC oscillations is increased by cholinergic activation in control rats and is reduced in kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy. OB γ2 (63–100 Hz) power was higher during walking and immobility-awake (IMM) compared to sleep, while γ1 (30–57 Hz) power was higher during grooming than other behavioral states. Muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (25 mg/kg ip) with peripheral muscarinic blockade increased OB power and OB-HPC coherence at β and γ1 frequency bands. A similar effect was found after physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg ip) but not scopolamine (10 mg/kg ip). Pilocarpine increased bicoherence and cross-frequency coherence (CFC) between OB slow waves (SW, 1–5 Hz) and hippocampal β, γ1 and γ2 waves, with stronger coherence at CA1 alveus and CA3c than CA1 stratum radiatum. Bicoherence further revealed a nonlinear interaction of β waves in OB with β waves at the CA1-alveus. Beta and γ1 waves in OB or HPC were segregated at one phase of the OB-SW, opposite to the phase of γ2 and γ3 (100–160 Hz) waves, suggesting independent temporal processing of β/γ1 versus γ2/γ3 waves. At CA1 radiatum, kainic-acid-treated epileptic rats compared to control rats showed decreased theta power, theta-β and theta-γ2 CFC during baseline walking, decreased CFC of HPC SW with γ2 and γ3 waves during baseline IMM, and decreased coupling of OB SW with β and γ2 waves at CA1 alveus after pilocarpine. It is concluded that β and γ waves in the OB and HPC are modulated by a slow respiratory rhythm, in a cholinergic and behavior-dependent manner, and OB-HPC functional connectivity at β and γ frequencies may enhance cognitive functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23625?af=R">Nogo‐A‐mediated constraints on activity‐dependent synaptic plasticity and associativity in rat hippocampal CA2 synapses</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-402/v2?src=rss">Anticancer activities of tocotrienols: A Systematic Scoping Review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The increasing number of cancer cases requires developing newer approaches to treat this disease. One approach uses natural compounds with known anticancer effects, such as tocotrienols. Many cell-based and animal-model studies found that tocotrienols possess potent anticancer activities. However, the exact molecular regulatory mechanism through which tocotrienols exert anticancer actions remains unclear. Methods: This scoping review analysed data from original research articles reporting on the anticancer effects of tocotrienols on human cancer cell lines published in the last seven years (January 2015 and September 2021) using a systematic scoping review approach. From the initial 619 research papers [ProQuest (n= 61), PubMed (n= 84), Embase (n = 148), Ovid Medline (n =53), Scopus (n = 137), Web of Science (n =136)] identified using pre-defined keywords, only 37 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. Human cancers commonly studied in the 37 research articles include breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines. Results: The analysis showed that exposing human cancer cell lines to tocotrienols triggered common anticancer mechanisms such as activation of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis and cell migration through regulation of key regulatory genes and proteins involved in these pathways. Conclusions: The findings show that tocotrienols regulate a number of biomarkers that induce cell death and regulate cell cycle in various types of human cancer cells. Further targeted studies are required to map the definite pathways by which T3 exerts their action and to better understand the cellular actions and the regulatory pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92826">Hyperglycemia induced cathepsin L maturation linked to diabetic comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes, a prevalent chronic condition, significantly increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with <i>CTSL</i> knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside <i>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></i>mice and <i>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></i>mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81571">Membrane curvature sensing and symmetry breaking of the M2 proton channel from Influenza A</a></h4>

              
                The M2 proton channel aids in the exit of mature influenza viral particles from the host plasma membrane through its ability to stabilize regions of high negative gaussian curvature (NGC) that occur at the neck of budding virions. The channels are homo-tetramers that contain a cytoplasm-facing amphipathic helix (AH) that is necessary and sufficient for NGC generation; however, constructs containing the transmembrane spanning helix, which facilitates tetramerization, exhibit enhanced curvature generation. Here we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of M2 channels in lipid bilayers revealing that the AH is dynamic, quickly breaking the 4-fold symmetry observed in most structures. Next, we carried out MD simulations with the protein restrained in 4-fold and 2-fold symmetric conformations to determine the impact on the membrane shape. While each pattern was distinct, all configurations induced pronounced curvature in the outer leaflet, while conversely, the inner leaflets showed minimal curvature and significant lipid tilt around the AHs. The MD-generated profiles at the protein-membrane interface were then extracted and used as boundary conditions in a continuum elastic membrane model to calculate the membrane bending energy of each conformation embedded in different membrane surfaces characteristic of a budding virus. The calculations show that all three M2 conformations are stabilized in inward-budding, concave spherical caps and destabilized in outward-budding, convex spherical caps, the latter reminiscent of a budding virus. One of the C2-broken symmetry conformations is stabilized by 4 kT in NGC surfaces with the minimum energy conformation occurring at a curvature corresponding to 33 nm radii. In total, our work provides atomistic insight into the curvature sensing capabilities of M2 channels and how enrichment in the nascent viral particle depends on protein shape and membrane geometry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91568">Biocalcification in porcelaneous foraminifera</a></h4>

              
                Living organisms control the formation of mineral skeletons and other structures through biomineralization. Major phylogenetic groups usually consistently follow a single biomineralization pathway. Foraminifera, which are very efficient marine calcifiers, making a substantial contribution to global carbonate production and global carbon sequestration, are regarded as an exception. This phylum has been commonly thought to follow two contrasting models of either <i>in situ</i> ‘mineralization of extracellular matrix’ attributed to hyaline rotaliid shells, or ‘mineralization within intracellular vesicles’ attributed to porcelaneous miliolid shells. Our previous results on rotaliids along with those on miliolids in this paper question such a wide divergence of biomineralization pathways within the same phylum of Foraminifera. We have found under a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that precipitation of high-Mg calcitic mesocrystals in porcelaneous shells takes place <i>in situ</i> and form a dense, chaotic meshwork of needle-like crystallites. We have not observed calcified needles that already precipitated in the transported vesicles, what challenges the previous model of miliolid mineralization. Hence, Foraminifera probably utilize less divergent calcification pathways, following the recently discovered biomineralization principles. Mesocrystalline chamber walls in both models are therefore most likely created by intravesicular accumulation of pre-formed liquid amorphous mineral phase deposited and crystallized within the extracellular organic matrix enclosed in a biologically controlled privileged space by active pseudopodial structures. Both calcification pathways evolved independently in the Paleozoic and are well conserved in two clades that represent different chamber formation modes.

	<p>Objectives: Hypersensitive acupoints in specific body areas are associated with corresponding internal or visceral disorders. Back-shu points are clinically significant for the diagnosis of visceral organ disease, according to the biomechanical characteristics of the acupoints. In this study, we assessed the biomechanical characteristics and pain sensitivities of five back-shu points linked to five visceral organs in healthy participants. Methods: The study included 48 volunteer participants. A myotonometry was used to assess muscle tone and muscle stiffness at five back-shu points associated with visceral organs. Pressure was monitored using a microcontroller and a force sensor. Pain sensitivity was assessed in response to deep pressure pain produced by a constant force. Results: Substantial differences in muscle tone and stiffness were observed at the five back-shu points; muscle tone was highest at BL15, whereas muscle tone and muscle stiffness were lowest at BL23. Moreover, pain sensitivity was significantly different among the acupoints; pain sensitivity was highest at BL23. There was a significant negative correlation between muscle tone and pain sensitivity. Conclusions: We found significant differences in muscle tone, muscle stiffness, and pain sensitivity among five back-shu points associated with visceral organs, which may be attributable to anatomical variations at each point. Our findings suggest that differences at back-shu points should be considered to ensure the accurate diagnosis of visceral disease.</p>

	<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective treatments for psychiatric disorders. ECT has proven effective in the treatment of depression, mania, catatonia and psychosis. It is presumed that seizures induced during ECT administration cause toxicity and potentially neuronal and glial cell death. A broad range of neurological disorders increase cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100b protein. This study aims to investigate the effect of ECT on NSE and S-100b levels, which, together, serve as a proxy for neuronal cell damage. Serum concentrations of S-100b and NSE of adult patients who received ECT were measured by immunoluminometric analysis before and after treatment. A two-way ANOVA test was used to estimate the statistical differences in marker concentrations between the subgroups of the study population. Results: A total of 55 patients were included in the analysis: 52.73% (n = 29) were diagnosed with depression, 21.82% (n = 12) with schizophrenia or other psychosis, 16.36% (n = 9) with mania and 9.09% (n = 5) with catatonia. There were no statistically significant changes in NSE (p = 0.288) and S-100b (p = 0.243) levels. We found no evidence that ECT induced neuronal damage based on NSE and S-100b protein levels measured in the serum of patients before and after treatment.</p>

	<p>Tracheostomy ventilation (TV) can increase survival time for people living with motor neurone disease (MND); however, the use of TV varies between countries. Concerns regarding anticipated quality of life (QoL) are among the reasons given by healthcare professionals for not recommending this intervention, yet little is known about QoL in this context. This scoping review was conducted to examine the evidence on QoL for those with MND who use TV and family members involved in their care. Using the methodological guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute, 23 papers were identified for inclusion, and findings were inductively analysed to identify key themes. We found that people living with MND tend to rate QoL post TV more positively than anticipated by healthcare professionals or family members. QoL was found to be related to positive relationships and activities the person could maintain. Feeling able to make a choice and an adequate level of financial resources were also important factors. Family members tended to experience lower QoL, associated with the uncertainty surrounding an emergency procedure and the complexity of subsequently required care. More evidence on QoL from the perspectives of people with MND who use TV is needed to support decision making and inform guidance.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can objectively reflect a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional state and have been widely studied in emotion recognition. However, the effective feature fusion and discriminative feature learning from EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS data is challenging. In order to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition, a graph convolution and capsule attention network model (GCN-CA-CapsNet) is proposed. Firstly, EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS signals are collected from 50 subjects induced by emotional video clips. And then, the features of the EEG and fNIRS are extracted; the EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS features are fused to generate higher-quality primary capsules by graph convolution with the Pearson correlation adjacency matrix. Finally, the capsule attention module is introduced to assign different weights to the primary capsules, and higher-quality primary capsules are selected to generate better classification capsules in the dynamic routing mechanism. We validate the efficacy of the proposed method on our emotional EEG&amp;amp;ndash;fNIRS dataset with an ablation study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GCN-CA-CapsNet method achieves a more satisfactory performance against the state-of-the-art methods, and the average accuracy can increase by 3&amp;amp;ndash;11%.</p>

	<p>This study investigated relations between a measure of early-stage visual function and self-reported visual anomalies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Eleven individuals at CHR identified via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) were recruited from a CHR-P research program in NYC. The sample was ~36% female, ranging from 16 to 33 years old (M = 23.90, SD = 6.14). Participants completed a contrast sensitivity task on an iPad with five spatial frequencies (0.41&amp;amp;ndash;13 cycles/degree) and completed the self-report Audio-Visual Abnormalities Questionnaire. Higher contrast sensitivity (better performance) to low spatial frequencies was associated with higher perceptual (r = 0.616, p = 0.044) and visual disturbances (r = 0.667, p = 0.025); lower contrast sensitivity to a middle spatial frequency was also associated with higher perceptual (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.604, p = 0.049) and visual disturbances (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.606, p = 0.048). This relation between the questionnaire and contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency may be indicative of a reduction in lateral inhibition and &amp;amp;ldquo;flooding&amp;amp;rdquo; of environmental stimuli. The association with middle spatial frequencies, which play a critical role in face processing, may result in a range of perceptual abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that self-reported perceptual anomalies occur in these individuals and are linked to performance on a measure of early visual processing.</p>

                Background In Australia, we are not meeting our goals in relation to breastfeeding overall, and in particular, promoting and supporting breastfeeding rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies especially breastfeeding to at least six months. The WHO has recognised the importance of exclusively breastfeeding a baby for a minimum of six months to ensure a healthy start to life. Breastfeeding has been shown to be a protective factor against asthma and allergy development, ear disease, infections, respiratory illness and gastrointestinal issues. This study aims to improve predominant breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies in the Perth Metropolitan area (Western Australia, Australia). Methods and analysis We will use an interrupted time series design to determine the effectiveness of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program delivered over 6 months by selected community health staff. The intervention will be delivered at two community health regions and the remaining 17 community health regions will be the control group. The primary outcomes will be predominant breastfeeding rates at two and four months, and secondary outcomes will include any breastfeeding at two and four months, and hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and immunisation data at 6 months. Discussion The study will allow us to determine the breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal babies, identify the barriers and enablers to initiating and maintaining breastfeeding and determine whether a CQI program can achieve improvements in breastfeeding rates.

                <p>by Scott L. Nuismer, Andrew J. Basinski, Courtney L. Schreiner, Evan A. Eskew, Elisabeth Fichet-Calvet, Christopher H. Remien</p>

Reducing spillover of zoonotic pathogens is an appealing approach to preventing human disease and minimizing the risk of future epidemics and pandemics. Although the immediate human health benefit of reducing spillover is clear, over time, spillover reduction could lead to counterintuitive negative consequences for human health. Here, we use mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the conditions under which unanticipated consequences of spillover reduction can occur in systems where the severity of disease increases with age at infection. Our results demonstrate that, because the average age at infection increases as spillover is reduced, programs that reduce spillover can actually increase population-level disease burden if the clinical severity of infection increases sufficiently rapidly with age. If, however, immunity wanes over time and reinfection is possible, our results reveal that negative health impacts of spillover reduction become substantially less likely. When our model is parameterized using published data on Lassa virus in West Africa, it predicts that negative health outcomes are possible, but likely to be restricted to a small subset of populations where spillover is unusually intense. Together, our results suggest that adverse consequences of spillover reduction programs are unlikely but that the public health gains observed immediately after spillover reduction may fade over time as the age structure of immunity gradually re-equilibrates to a reduced force of infection.

                <p>by Rachael Stentiford, James C. Knight, Thomas Nowotny, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

The central complex of insects contains cells, organised as a ring attractor, that encode head direction. The ‘bump’ of activity in the ring can be updated by idiothetic cues and external sensory information. Plasticity at the synapses between these cells and the ring neurons, that are responsible for bringing sensory information into the central complex, has been proposed to form a mapping between visual cues and the heading estimate which allows for more accurate tracking of the current heading, than if only idiothetic information were used. In Drosophila, ring neurons have well characterised non-linear receptive fields. In this work we produce synthetic versions of these visual receptive fields using a combination of excitatory inputs and mutual inhibition between ring neurons. We use these receptive fields to bring visual information into a spiking neural network model of the insect central complex based on the recently published Drosophila connectome. Previous modelling work has focused on how this circuit functions as a ring attractor using the same type of simple visual cues commonly used experimentally. While we initially test the model on these simple stimuli, we then go on to apply the model to complex natural scenes containing multiple conflicting cues. We show that this simple visual filtering provided by the ring neurons is sufficient to form a mapping between heading and visual features and maintain the heading estimate in the absence of angular velocity input. The network is successful at tracking heading even when presented with videos of natural scenes containing conflicting information from environmental changes and translation of the camera.

Enteric pathogens navigate distinct regional microenvironments within the intestine that cue important adaptive behaviors. We investigated the response of <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>, a model of human pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection in mice, to regional gastrointestinal pH. We found that small intestinal pH (4.4–4.8) triggered virulence gene expression and altered cell morphology, supporting initial intestinal attachment, while higher pH, representative of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i>’s replicative niches further along the murine intestine, supported pathogen growth. Gastric pH, a key barrier to intestinal colonization, caused significant accumulation of intra-bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting growth of <i>C</i>. <i>rodentium</i> and related human pathogens. Within-host adaptation increased gastric acid survival, which may be due to a robust acid tolerance response (ATR) induced at colonic pH. However, the intestinal environment changes throughout the course of infection. We found that murine gastric pH decreases postinfection, corresponding to increased serum gastrin levels and altered host expression of acid secretion-related genes. Similar responses following <i>Salmonella</i> infection may indicate a protective host response to limit further pathogen ingestion. Together, we highlight interlinked bacterial and host adaptive pH responses as an important component of host–pathogen coevolution.

                <p>by Alex E. Yuan, Wenying Shou</p>

In disciplines from biology to climate science, a routine task is to compute a correlation between a pair of time series and determine whether the correlation is statistically significant (i.e., unlikely under the null hypothesis that the time series are independent). This problem is challenging because time series typically exhibit autocorrelation and thus cannot be properly analyzed with the standard iid-oriented statistical tests. Although there are well-known parametric tests for time series, these are designed for linear correlation statistics and thus not suitable for the increasingly popular nonlinear correlation statistics. There are also nonparametric tests that can be used with any correlation statistic, but for these, the conditions that guarantee correct false positive rates are either restrictive or unclear. Here, we describe the truncated time-shift (TTS) test, a nonparametric procedure to test for dependence between 2 time series. We prove that this test correctly controls the false positive rate as long as one of the time series is stationary, a minimally restrictive requirement among current tests. The TTS test is versatile because it can be used with any correlation statistic. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that this test performs correctly even while other tests suffer high false positive rates. In simulation examples, simple guidelines for parameter choices allow high statistical power to be achieved with sufficient data. We apply the test to datasets from climatology, animal behavior, and microbiome science, verifying previously discovered dependence relationships and detecting additional relationships.

Horizontal mitochondrial transfer (HMT) has emerged as a novel phenomenon in cell biology, but it is unclear how this process of intercellular movement of mitochondria is regulated. A new study in <i>PLOS Biology</i> reports that ADP released by stressed cells is a signal that triggers HMT.

                <p>by Kevin Gross, Carl T. Bergstrom</p>

Scientific research requires taking risks, as the most cautious approaches are unlikely to lead to the most rapid progress. Yet, much funded scientific research plays it safe and funding agencies bemoan the difficulty of attracting high-risk, high-return research projects. Why don’t the incentives for scientific discovery adequately impel researchers toward such projects? Here, we adapt an economic contracting model to explore how the unobservability of risk and effort discourages risky research. The model considers a hidden-action problem, in which the scientific community must reward discoveries in a way that encourages effort and risk-taking while simultaneously protecting researchers’ livelihoods against the vicissitudes of scientific chance. Its challenge when doing so is that incentives to motivate effort clash with incentives to motivate risk-taking, because a failed project may be evidence of a risky undertaking but could also be the result of simple sloth. As a result, the incentives needed to encourage effort actively discourage risk-taking. Scientists respond by working on safe projects that generate evidence of effort but that don’t move science forward as rapidly as riskier projects would. A social planner who prizes scientific productivity above researchers’ well-being could remedy the problem by rewarding major discoveries richly enough to induce high-risk research, but in doing so would expose scientists to a degree of livelihood risk that ultimately leaves them worse off. Because the scientific community is approximately self-governing and constructs its own reward schedule, the incentives that researchers are willing to impose on themselves are inadequate to motivate the scientific risks that would best expedite scientific progress.

                <p>by Jessica E. Buddle, Lucy M. Thompson, Anne S. Williams, Rosanna C. T. Wright, William M. Durham, Claire E. Turner, Roy R. Chaudhuri, Michael A. Brockhurst, Robert P. Fagan</p>

<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> is an important human pathogen, for which there are very limited treatment options, primarily the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin. In recent years, vancomycin resistance has emerged as a serious problem in several gram-positive pathogens, but high-level resistance has yet to be reported for <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>, although it is not known if this is due to constraints upon resistance evolution in this species. Here, we show that resistance to vancomycin can evolve rapidly under ramping selection but is accompanied by fitness costs and pleiotropic trade-offs, including sporulation defects that would be expected to severely impact transmission. We identified 2 distinct pathways to resistance, both of which are predicted to result in changes to the muropeptide terminal D-Ala-D-Ala that is the primary target of vancomycin. One of these pathways involves a previously uncharacterised D,D-carboxypeptidase, expression of which is controlled by a dedicated two-component signal transduction system. Our findings suggest that while <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i> is capable of evolving high-level vancomycin resistance, this outcome may be limited clinically due to pleiotropic effects on key pathogenicity traits. Moreover, our data identify potential mutational routes to resistance that should be considered in genomic surveillance.

                <p>by Corinne von Känel, Philip Stettler, Carmela Esposito, Stephan Berger, Simona Amodeo, Silke Oeljeklaus, Salvatore Calderaro, Ignacio M. Durante, Vendula Rašková, Bettina Warscheid, André Schneider</p>

Protein import and genome replication are essential processes for mitochondrial biogenesis and propagation. The J-domain proteins Pam16 and Pam18 regulate the presequence translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the protozoan <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, their counterparts are TbPam16 and TbPam18, which are essential for the procyclic form (PCF) of the parasite, though not involved in mitochondrial protein import. Here, we show that during evolution, the 2 proteins have been repurposed to regulate the replication of maxicircles within the intricate kDNA network, the most complex mitochondrial genome known. TbPam18 and TbPam16 have inactive J-domains suggesting a function independent of heat shock proteins. However, their single transmembrane domain is essential for function. Pulldown of TbPam16 identifies a putative client protein, termed MaRF11, the depletion of which causes the selective loss of maxicircles, akin to the effects observed for TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, depletion of the mitochondrial proteasome results in increased levels of MaRF11. Thus, we have discovered a protein complex comprising TbPam18, TbPam16, and MaRF11, that controls maxicircle replication. We propose a working model in which the matrix protein MaRF11 functions downstream of the 2 integral inner membrane proteins TbPam18 and TbPam16. Moreover, we suggest that the levels of MaRF11 are controlled by the mitochondrial proteasome.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Background Food security’s multidimensional nature poses challenges in measurement and policy targeting. This comprehensive study explores the nexus between small-scale irrigation and household food security in Raya Kobo Woreda, Ethiopia, in a cross-sectional data. Methods Employing a two-stage sampling technique, the research examines 152 irrigation participants and 196 non-participants. Utilizing descriptive and econometric models, including a binary logit model and propensity score matching. Results The study reveals that 15% of participants and 12% of non-participants are food secure. Descriptive analysis reveals positive correlations between irrigation participation and household food security, dietary diversity, and food consumption scores. Econometric analysis identifies factors influencing participation, such as the age of the household head, family size and tropical livestock units have negative relationship with irrigation participation while the importance of agriculture is found to be positively associated with irrigation participation. Propensity score matching reveals a substantial positive impact on household expenditure, reaffirmed through sensitivity analysis. Conclusion The findings contribute to understanding the complexities of small-scale irrigation in enhancing rural livelihoods and emphasize the importance of targeted interventions for sustained positive outcomes.

                Background Cataracts are a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness globally, with a particularly high incidence in diabetic patients due to the complex interplay of metabolic dysregulation and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Diabetic cataract development is influenced by several modifiable risk factors including smoking and hypertension, which may exacerbate lens opacity through various biological mechanisms. This study aims to determine the effects of smoking and hypertension on cataract development in diabetic patients. Methods Conducted from December 2022 to November 2023, this cross-sectional study at a specialized diabetes and ophthalmology healthcare facility involved 60 diabetic patients. The participants were divided into two groups: those with cataracts (n=32) and those without (n=28). Data collection focused on demographics, smoking history, hypertension status, and cataract presence, using structured interviews and medical record reviews. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between cataracts and potential risk factors, adjusting for age, diabetes duration, and glycemic control. Results Age and genderfi were not significantly different between the two groups, with mean ages of 50.21±14.34 years in the cataract group and 49.41±12.15 years in the non-cataract group (P=0.087). The prevalence of smoking was similar between those with cataracts (14.3%) and without (15.6%), showing no significant association (P=0.885). Hypertension was more prevalent in the cataract group (71.4%) compared to the non-cataract group (53.1%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.146). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking had a minimal effect on cataract development (OR=1.187; 95% CI=0.264-5.33; P=0.823), and while hypertension showed a stronger association (OR=2.277; 95% CI=0.749-6.92), it also lacked statistical significance (P=0.147). Conclusion Neither smoking nor hypertension showed significant associations with cataract development. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on cataract progression may differ in diabetic individuals due to the complex interplay of metabolic and vascular changes associated with the condition.

                Background Acute coronary syndromes refer to STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina. The preferred biomarkers for assessing myocardial damage are cTnI and cTnT, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are recommended in clinical practice. Other biomarkers such as CK-MB have lower sensitivity and specificity. Platelets play a major role in thrombosis, which is a causative factor for most acute coronary syndromes. In our study, we attempted to analyze the effectiveness of platelet indices (mean platelet volume, platelet count, and platelet distribution width) as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes. Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, and plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers. Methods A total of 290 subjects were recruited for the study, including 145 cases and 145 controls matched for sex and age. Cases presented with the first episode of acute coronary syndrome. Controls are those without acute coronary syndrome during present admission or in the past. Results MPV and plateletcrit correlated with both troponin T and pro-BNP, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with troponin T. The only significant correlation was between the plateletcrit and pro-BNP levels. The plateletcrit showed a positive correlation with other parameters (degree of ventricular dysfunction, severity of coronary artery disease, and presence of arrhythmia). On comparing platelet indices with risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, MPV showed a positive correlation with HbA1c and the entire lipid profile, whereas PDW showed a positive correlation only with HbA1c and triglycerides. The plateletcrit was positively correlated with HbA1c and total cholesterol levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are potential diagnostic markers, whereas plateletcrits can serve as prognostic markers.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

                Background: Conversion therapy practices (CTPs) are discredited efforts that target lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, Two-Spirit, or other (LGBTQ2S+) people and seek to change, deny, or discourage their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of CTPs across Canadian provinces and territories and identify whether CTP bans reduce the prevalence of CTPs. Methods: We collected 119 CTPs from 31 adults (18+) in Canada who have direct experience with CTPs, know people who have gone to CTPs, or know of conversion therapy practitioners using a 2020 anonymous online survey. Mapping analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Online. CTP prevalence was compared between provinces/territories with and without bans using chi-square tests. Results: Three provinces and eleven municipalities had CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories with bans was 2.34 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 1.65, 3.31). The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 4.13 per 1,000,000 population (95% CI 3.32, 5.14). Accounting for the underlying population, provinces/territories with the highest prevalence of CTPs per 1,000,000 population were New Brunswick (6.69), Nova Scotia (6.50), and Saskatchewan (6.37). Conclusions: Findings suggest only 55% of Canadians were protected under CTP bans. The prevalence of CTPs in provinces/territories without bans was 1.76 times greater than provinces/territories with bans. CTPs are occurring in most provinces/territories, with higher prevalence in the west and the Atlantic. These findings and continued efforts to monitor CTP prevalence can help inform policymakers and legislators as society is increasingly acknowledging CTPs as a threat to the health and well-being of LGBTQ2S+ people.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-923/v1?src=rss">Uncaria nervosa Elmer, a new herbal source for betulinic acid and ursolic acid: Metabolites profiling, isolation, and in vitro cytotoxicity studies against T47D breast cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Uncaria nervosa Elmer is an Indonesian herbal plant that is traditionally used for breast cancer. The results of phytochemical screening contained alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the ethanol extract of this plant. Based on literature searches, reports regarding the bioactive compounds responsible for breast cancer have not been found. Further research is needed to understand the potential of Uncaria nervosa Elmer as a breast cancer treatment and to identify the specific compounds responsible for its effects Methods This study aims to determine the metabolite profiling of ethanol extract, the isolation, characterization of bioactive compounds, and their bioactivity in T47D breast cancer cells. The research began by extracting the leaves by maceration using 70% ethanol, and then solid phase extraction was carried out using the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. In this study, the sorbent used was polyamide. The extract was analyzed using a tandem analysis technique based on LCMS using the MZmine and SIRIUS platforms. Isolation was carried out using column chromatography, and preparative recycling HPLC. Bioactive compounds were characterized using UV, HPLC, NMR, and 2D NMR, as well as bioactivity tests using the MTT method. Results The results show that the extract contained N-[(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-7-prop-2-ynylpurin-8-yl) amino] formamide, N-(3-phenylbutyl)hexan-2-amine, 1,1-Dichloro-1-nitrosopropane, ceratodictyol, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, 7-methyl-N-[6-[(7-methyl-6-oxooctanoyl) amino] hexyl]-6-oxononanamide, Nervisterol and 3,5,10-tris (acetyloxy)-2-hydroxy-4,14,16,16-tetramethyl-8-methylidene-13-oxo-15oxatetracyclo [9.4.1.01,14.04,9] hexadecan-7-yl 3-phenylprop-2-enoate. The ethanol extract of Uncaria nervosa Elmer leaves contains nine compounds consisting of alkaloids, terpenoids, and fatty acid. The bioactive compounds that were successfully isolated were betulinic acid, and ursolic acid, with IC50 values of ˃100 and 14,70±4,50 μg/ml, respectively. These compounds were reported in this plant for the first time. Conclusion Betulinic acid, and ursolic acid have been successfully isolated from leaves Uncaria nervosa Elmer, and ursolic acid have moderate cytotoxic activity on T47D breast cancer cells.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23631?af=R">Differential role of NMDA receptors in hippocampal‐dependent spatial memory and plasticity in juvenile male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97107">A dynamic generative model can extract interpretable oscillatory components from multichannel neurophysiological recordings</a></h4>

              
                Modern neurophysiological recordings are performed using multichannel sensor arrays that are able to record activity in an increasingly high number of channels numbering in the 100s to 1000s. Often, underlying lower-dimensional patterns of activity are responsible for the observed dynamics, but these representations are difficult to reliably identify using existing methods that attempt to summarize multivariate relationships in a post hoc manner from univariate analyses or using current blind source separation methods. While such methods can reveal appealing patterns of activity, determining the number of components to include, assessing their statistical significance, and interpreting them requires extensive manual intervention and subjective judgment in practice. These difficulties with component selection and interpretation occur in large part because these methods lack a generative model for the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics. Here, we describe a novel component analysis method anchored by a generative model where each source is described by a bio-physically inspired state-space representation. The parameters governing this representation readily capture the oscillatory temporal dynamics of the components, so we refer to it as oscillation component analysis. These parameters – the oscillatory properties, the component mixing weights at the sensors, and the number of oscillations – all are inferred in a data-driven fashion within a Bayesian framework employing an instance of the expectation maximization algorithm. We analyze high-dimensional electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings from human studies to illustrate the potential utility of this method for neuroscience data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95009">Exploring the role of the immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma: Implications for immunotherapy and drug resistance</a></h4>

              
                Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver tumor, is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and the incidence of liver cancer is still increasing worldwide. Curative hepatectomy or liver transplantation is only indicated for a small population of patients with early-stage HCC. However, most patients with HCC are not candidates for radical resection due to disease progression, leading to the choice of the conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib as first-line treatment. In the past few years, immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized the clinical strategy for HCC. Combination therapy with ICIs has proven more effective than sorafenib, and clinical trials have been conducted to apply these therapies to patients. Despite significant progress in immunotherapy, the molecular mechanisms behind it remain unclear, and immune resistance is often challenging to overcome. Several studies have pointed out that the complex intercellular communication network in the immune microenvironment of HCC regulates tumor escape and drug resistance to immune response. This underscores the urgent need to analyze the immune microenvironment of HCC. This review describes the immunosuppressive cell populations in the immune microenvironment of HCC, as well as the related clinical trials, aiming to provide insights for the next generation of precision immunotherapy.

Recent advancements in experimental techniques, including high-throughput sequencing and microscopy, have provided valuable insights into nuclear organization. Computational modeling has played significant roles in interpreting experimental observations by reconstructing high-resolution structural ensembles and uncovering organization principles. However, the absence of standardized modeling tools poses challenges for furthering nuclear investigations. We present OpenNucleome—an open-source software designed for conducting GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of the human nucleus. OpenNucleome offers particle-based representations of chromosomes at a resolution of 100 KB, encompassing nuclear lamina, nucleoli, and speckles. This software furnishes highly accurate structural models of nuclear architecture, affording the means for dynamic simulations of condensate formation, fusion, and exploration of non-equilibrium effects. We applied OpenNucleome to uncover the mechanisms driving the emergence of ‘fixed points’ within the nucleus—signifying genomic loci robustly anchored in proximity to specific nuclear bodies for functional purposes. This anchoring remains resilient even amidst significant fluctuations in chromosome radial positions and nuclear shapes within individual cells. Our findings lend support to a nuclear zoning model that elucidates genome functionality. We anticipate OpenNucleome to serve as a valuable tool for nuclear investigations, streamlining mechanistic explorations and enhancing the interpretation of experimental observations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85794">A rapid phylogeny-based method for accurate community profiling of large-scale metabarcoding datasets</a></h4>

              
                Environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming an increasingly important tool in diverse scientific fields from ecological biomonitoring to wastewater surveillance of viruses. The fundamental challenge in eDNA analyses has been the bioinformatical assignment of reads to taxonomic groups. It has long been known that full probabilistic methods for phylogenetic assignment are preferable, but unfortunately, such methods are computationally intensive and are typically inapplicable to modern Next-Generation Sequencing data. We here present a fast approximate likelihood method for phylogenetic assignment of DNA sequences. Applying the new method to several mock communities and simulated datasets, we show that it identifies more reads at both high and low taxonomic levels more accurately than other leading methods. The advantage of the method is particularly apparent in the presence of polymorphisms and/or sequencing errors and when the true species is not represented in the reference database.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80622">Plasticity-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft regulates intracellular AMPA receptor trafficking</a></h4>

              
                AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing plasticity to increase synaptic transmission, but it is not fully understood if and how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses. Here, we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from their endogenous loci in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and characterized the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced structural plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of synaptic activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96496">Probing PAC1 receptor activation across species with an engineered sensor</a></h4>

              
                Class-B1 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an important family of clinically relevant drug targets that remain difficult to investigate via high-throughput screening and in animal models. Here, we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, a novel genetically encoded sensor based on a class-B1 GPCR (the human PAC1 receptor, hmPAC1R) endowed with high dynamic range (Δ<i>F</i>/<i>F</i><sub>0</sub> = 1100%), excellent ligand selectivity, and rapid activation kinetics (<i>τ</i><sub>ON</sub> = 1.15 s). To showcase the utility of this tool for in vitro applications, we thoroughly characterized and compared its expression, brightness and performance between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-transfected and stably expressing cells. Demonstrating its use in animal models, we show robust expression and fluorescence responses upon exogenous ligand application ex vivo and in vivo in mice, as well as in living zebrafish larvae. Thus, the new GPCR-based sensor can be used for a wide range of applications across the life sciences empowering both basic research and drug development efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97327">RGS10 deficiency facilitates distant metastasis by inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Distant metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with breast cancer. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Regulator of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins modulates metastasis in various cancers. This study identified a novel role for RGS10 in EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues, and deficiency in RGS10 protein predicted a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer. RGS10 protein levels were lower in the highly aggressive cell line MDA-MB-231 than in the poorly aggressive, less invasive cell lines MCF7 and SKBR3. Silencing <i>RGS10</i> in SKBR3 cells enhanced EMT and caused SKBR3 cell migration and invasion. The ability of RGS10 to suppress EMT and metastasis in breast cancer was dependent on lipocalin-2 and <i>MIR539-5p</i>. These findings identify RGS10 as a tumor suppressor, prognostic biomarker, and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

	<p>In recent years, EEG-based emotion recognition technology has made progress, but there are still problems of low model efficiency and loss of emotional information, and there is still room for improvement in recognition accuracy. To fully utilize EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional information and improve recognition accuracy while reducing computational costs, this paper proposes a Convolutional-Recurrent Hybrid Network with a dual-stream adaptive approach and an attention mechanism (CSA-SA-CRTNN). Firstly, the model utilizes a CSAM module to assign corresponding weights to EEG channels. Then, an adaptive dual-stream convolutional-recurrent network (SA-CRNN and MHSA-CRNN) is applied to extract local spatial-temporal features. After that, the extracted local features are concatenated and fed into a temporal convolutional network with a multi-head self-attention mechanism (MHSA-TCN) to capture global information. Finally, the extracted EEG information is used for emotion classification. We conducted binary and ternary classification experiments on the DEAP dataset, achieving 99.26% and 99.15% accuracy for arousal and valence in binary classification and 97.69% and 98.05% in ternary classification, and on the SEED dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.63%, surpassing relevant algorithms. Additionally, the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficiency is significantly higher than other models, achieving better accuracy with lower resource consumption.</p>

	<p>Neurodegeneration occurs naturally as humans age, but the presence of additional pathogenic mechanisms yields harmful and consequential effects on the brain. Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a composite of such factors. Despite extensive research to identify the exact causes of AD, therapeutic approaches for treating the disease continue to be ineffective, indicating important gaps in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an endogenous class of regulatory RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, involved in various regulatory networks, whose dysregulation is evident in several neural and extraneural diseases. LncRNAs are ubiquitously expressed across all tissues with a wide range of functions, including controlling cell differentiation and development, responding to environmental stimuli, and other physiological processes. Several lncRNAs have been identified as potential contributors in worsening neurodegeneration due to altered regulation during abnormal pathological conditions. Within neurological disease, lncRNAs are prime candidates for use as biomarkers and pharmacological targets. Gender-associated lncRNA expression is altered in a gender-dependent manner for AD, suggesting more research needs to be focused on this relationship. Overall, research on lncRNAs and their connection to neurodegenerative disease is growing exponentially, as commercial enterprises are already designing and employing RNA therapeutics. In this review we offer a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on the role of lncRNAs in AD and discuss the potential implications of lncRNA as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Most intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can be treated either with microsurgical clipping or endovascular techniques. In a few cases, simultaneous treatment utilizing both modalities in a hybrid operation room may be favorable. This study analyzes the indication and benefits of a true hybrid approach (tHA) that combines simultaneous endovascular and microsurgical procedures for treatment of IAs in one session. (2) Methods: All patients receiving a true hybrid procedure between 2010 and 2022 in our institution were included. Demographic characteristics, neurological symptoms, pre-interventional treatments, angiographic findings, and postoperative clinical and radiological outcomes were analyzed. Results are discussed in the light of a systematic literature review on reported true hybrid procedures for IA treatment. (3) Results: In total, 10 tHAs were performed. Of these, coiling and concomitant decompressive craniectomy or hematoma evacuation was performed on six occasions. In two patients, multiple IAs were treated with different modalities during the same procedure. In two patients, intraoperative conditions did not allow for complete IA clipping, and the remnant was coiled in the same session. The review of the literature revealed nine papers comprising 58 IAs treated with a tHA. (4) Conclusions: The need for a tHA for IA treatment is rare and limited to highly selective cases. In our experience, tHAs have been most valuable in an emergency setting concerning ruptured IAs. Furthermore, tHAs may also be considered in patients with multiple aneurysms in different vascular territories.</p>

	<p>Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) experience severe face memory deficits that are often accompanied by impairments in face perception. Images of human facial features are better discriminated between when they are presented in the locations on the visual field that they typically appear in while viewing human faces in daily life, than in locations which they do not typically appear (i.e., better performance for eyes in the upper visual field, and better performance for mouths in the lower visual field). These feature-to-location tuning effects (FLEs) can be explained by a retinotopically organised visual statistical learning mechanism. We had a large group of DP participants (N = 64), a control group (N = 74) and a group of individuals with a mild form of DP (N = 58) complete a single-feature discrimination task to determine whether face perception deficits in DP can be accounted for by an impairment in face feature-to-location tuning. The results showed that individuals with DP did not have significant FLEs, suggesting a marked impairment in the underlying visual statistical learning mechanism. In contrast, the mild DP group showed normal FLE effects which did not differ from the control group. Both DP groups had impaired single-feature processing (SFP) as compared to the control group. We also examined the effects of age on FLEs and SFP.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region plays an important role in learning and memory. CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) receive two prominent excitatory inputs&mdash;mossy fibers (MFs) from dentate gyrus (DG) and recurrent collaterals (RCs) from CA3 PNs&mdash;that play opposing roles in pattern separation and pattern completion, respectively. Although the dorsoventral heterogeneity of the hippocampal anatomy, physiology, and behavior has been well established, nothing is known about the dorsoventral heterogeneity of synaptic connectivity in CA3 PNs. In this study, we performed Timm's sulfide silver staining, dendritic and spine morphological analyses, and ex vivo electrophysiology in mice of both sexes to investigate the heterogeneity of MF and RC pathways along the CA3 dorsoventral axis. Our morphological analyses demonstrate that ventral CA3 (vCA3) PNs possess greater dendritic lengths and more complex dendritic arborization, compared with dorsal CA3 (dCA3) PNs. Moreover, using ChannelRhodopsin2 (ChR2)-assisted patch-clamp recording, we found that the ratio of the RC-to-MF excitatory drive onto CA3 PNs increases substantially from dCA3 to vCA3, with vCA3 PNs receiving significantly weaker MFs, but stronger RCs, excitation than dCA3 PNs. Given the distinct roles of MF versus RC inputs in pattern separation versus completion, our findings of the significant dorsoventral variations of MF and RC excitation in CA3 PNs may have important functional implications for the contribution of CA3 circuit to the dorsoventral difference in hippocampal function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e0382242024?rss=1">Fast Inhibition Slows and Desynchronizes Mouse Auditory Efferent Neuron Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The encoding of acoustic stimuli requires precise neuron timing. Auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and brainstem are&nbsp;well suited for accurate analysis of fast acoustic signals, given their physiological specializations of fast membrane time constants, fast axonal conduction, and reliable synaptic transmission. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) neurons that provide efferent inhibition of the cochlea reside in the ventral brainstem and participate in these fast neural circuits. However, their modulation of cochlear function occurs over time scales of a slower nature. This suggests the presence of mechanisms that reduce MOC inhibition of cochlear function. To determine how monaural excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs integrate to affect the timing of MOC neuron activity, we developed a novel in vitro slice preparation ("wedge-slice"). The wedge-slice maintains the ascending auditory nerve root, the entire CN and projecting axons, while preserving the ability to perform visually guided patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings from genetically identified MOC neurons. The "in vivo-like" timing of the wedge-slice demonstrates that the inhibitory pathway accelerates relative to the excitatory pathway when the ascending circuit is intact, and the CN portion of the inhibitory circuit is precise enough to compensate for reduced precision in later synapses. When combined with machine learning PSC analysis and computational modeling, we demonstrate a larger suppression of MOC neuron activity when the inhibition occurs with in vivo-like timing. This delay of MOC activity may ensure that the MOC system is only engaged by sustained background sounds, preventing a maladaptive hypersuppression of cochlear activity.</p>

                <p>Humans are immensely curious and motivated to reduce uncertainty, but little is known about the neural mechanisms that generate curiosity. Curiosity is inversely associated with confidence, suggesting that it is triggered by states of low confidence (subjective uncertainty), but the neural mechanisms of this link, have been little investigated. Inspired by studies of sensory uncertainty, we hypothesized that visual areas provide multivariate representations of uncertainty, which are read out by higher-order structures to generate signals of confidence and, ultimately, curiosity. We scanned participants (17 female, 15 male) using fMRI while they performed a new task in which they rated their confidence in identifying distorted images of animals and objects and their curiosity to see the clear image. We measured the activity evoked by each image in the occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) and devised a new metric of "OTC Certainty" indicating the strength of evidence this activity conveys about the animal versus object categories. We show that, perceptual curiosity peaked at low confidence and OTC Certainty negatively correlated with curiosity, establishing a link between curiosity and a multivariate representation of sensory uncertainty. Moreover, univariate (average) activity in two frontal areas&mdash;vmPFC and ACC&mdash;correlated positively with confidence and negatively with curiosity, and the vmPFC mediated the relationship between OTC Certainty and curiosity. The results reveal novel mechanisms through which uncertainty about an event generates curiosity about that event.</p>

                <p>The neocortex and striatum are topographically organized for sensory and motor functions. While sensory and motor areas are lateralized for touch and motor control, respectively, frontal areas are involved in decision-making, where lateralization of function may be less important. This study contrasted the topographic precision of cell-type&ndash;specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical projections while varying the injection site location in transgenic mice of both sexes. While sensory cortical areas had strongly topographic outputs to the ipsilateral cortex and striatum, they were weaker and not as topographically precise to contralateral targets. The motor cortex had somewhat stronger projections but still relatively weak contralateral topography. In contrast, frontal cortical areas had high degrees of topographic similarity for both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the cortex and striatum. Corticothalamic organization is mainly ipsilateral, with weaker, more medial contralateral projections. Corticostriatal computations might integrate input outside closed basal ganglia loops using contralateral projections, enabling the two hemispheres to act as a unit to converge on one result in motor planning and decision-making.</p>

                <p>Synapses are fundamental to the function of the central nervous system and are implicated in a number of brain disorders. Despite their pivotal role, a comprehensive imaging resource detailing the distribution of synapses in the human brain has been lacking until now. Here, we employ high-resolution PET neuroimaging in healthy humans (17F/16M) to create a 3D atlas of the synaptic marker Synaptic Vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Calibration to absolute density values (pmol/ml) was achieved by leveraging postmortem human brain autoradiography data. The atlas unveils distinctive cortical and subcortical gradients of synapse density that reflect functional topography and hierarchical order from core sensory to higher-order integrative areas&mdash;a distribution that diverges from SV2A mRNA patterns. Furthermore, we found a positive association between IQ and SV2A density in several higher-order cortical areas. This new resource will help advance our understanding of brain physiology and the pathogenesis of brain disorders, serving as a pivotal tool for future neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/33/e2012232024?rss=1">Conflicting Sensory Information Sharpens the Neural Representations of Early Selective Visuospatial Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adaptive behaviors require the ability to resolve conflicting information caused by the processing of incompatible sensory inputs. Prominent theories of attention have posited that early selective attention helps mitigate cognitive interference caused by conflicting sensory information by facilitating the processing of task-relevant sensory inputs and filtering out behaviorally irrelevant information. Surprisingly, many recent studies that investigated the role of early selective attention on conflict mitigation have failed to provide positive evidence. Here, we examined changes in the selectivity of early visuospatial attention in male and female human subjects performing an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task, where they discriminated the shape of a visual target surrounded by congruent or incongruent distractors. We used the inverted encoding model to reconstruct spatial representations of visual selective attention from the topographical patterns of amplitude modulations in alpha band oscillations in scalp EEG (~8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz). We found that the fidelity of the alpha-based spatial reconstruction was significantly higher in the incongruent compared with the congruent condition. Importantly, these conflict-related modulations in the reconstruction fidelity occurred at a much earlier time window than those of the lateralized posterior event-related potentials associated with target selection and distractor suppression processes, as well as conflict-related modulations in the frontocentral negative-going wave and midline-frontal theta oscillations (~3&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz), thought to track executive control functions. Taken together, our data suggest that conflict resolution is supported by the cascade of neural processes underlying early selective visuospatial attention and frontal executive functions that unfold over time.</p>

                <p>An economic choice entails computing and comparing the values of individual offers. Offer values are represented in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)&mdash;an area that participates in value comparison&mdash;but it is unknown where offer values are computed in the first place. One possibility is that this computation takes place in OFC. Alternatively, offer values might be computed upstream of OFC. For choices between edible goods, a primary candidate is the gustatory region of the anterior insula (gustatory cortex, GC). Here we recorded from the GC of male rhesus monkeys choosing between different juice types. As a population, neurons in GC represented the flavor, the quantity, and the subjective value of the juice chosen by the animal. These variables were represented by distinct groups of cells and with different time courses. Specifically, chosen value signals emerged shortly after offer presentation, while neurons encoding the chosen juice and the chosen quantity peaked after juice delivery. Surprisingly, neurons in GC did not represent individual offer values in a systematic way. In a computational sense, the variables encoded in GC follow the process of value comparison. Thus our results argue against the hypothesis that offer values are computed in GC. At the same time, signals representing the subjective value of the expected reward indicate that responses in GC are not purely sensory. Thus neuronal responses in GC appear consummatory in nature.</p>
