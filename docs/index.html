              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04549">Discounting and Drug Seeking in Biological Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a strong desire to quit, individuals with long-term substance use disorder (SUD) often struggle to resist drug use, even when aware of its harmful consequences. This disconnect between knowledge and compulsive behavior reflects a fundamental cognitive-behavioral conflict in addiction. Neurobiologically, differential cue-induced activity within striatal subregions, along with dopamine-mediated connectivity from the ventral to the dorsal striatum, contributes to compulsive drug-seeking. However, the functional mechanism linking these findings to behavioral conflict remains unclear. Another hallmark of addiction is temporal discounting: individuals with drug dependence exhibit steeper discount rates than non-users. Assuming the ventral-dorsal striatal organization reflects a gradient from cognitive to motor representations, addiction can be modeled within a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. However, integrating discounting into biologically grounded HRL remains an open challenge. In this work, we build on a model showing how action choices reinforced with drug rewards become insensitive to the negative consequences that follow. We address the integration of discounting by ensuring natural reward values converge across all levels in the HRL hierarchy, while drug rewards diverge due to their dopaminergic effects. Our results show that high discounting amplifies drug-seeking across the hierarchy, linking faster discounting with increased addiction severity and impulsivity. We demonstrate alignment with empirical findings on temporal discounting and propose testable predictions, establishing addiction as a disorder of hierarchical decision-making.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04875">Consciousness via MIPT?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04906">TRACE: Contrastive learning for multi-trial time-series data in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural recording techniques such as two-photon imaging allow to acquire vast time-series datasets with responses of hundreds or thousands of neurons. Contrastive learning is a powerful self-supervised framework for learning representations of complex datasets. Existing applications for neural time series rely on generic data augmentations and do not exploit the multi-trial data structure inherent in many neural datasets. Here we present TRACE, a new contrastive learning framework that averages across different subsets of trials to generate positive pairs. TRACE allows to directly learn a two-dimensional embedding, combining ideas from contrastive learning and neighbor embeddings. We show that TRACE outperforms other methods, resolving fine response differences in simulated data. Further, using in vivo recordings, we show that the representations learned by TRACE capture both biologically relevant continuous variation, cell-type-related cluster structure, and can assist data quality control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04943">The Hippocampal Place Field Gradient: An Eigenmode Theory Linking Grid Cell Projections to Multiscale Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hippocampus encodes space through a striking gradient of place field sizes along its dorsal-ventral axis, yet the principles generating this continuous gradient from discrete grid cell inputs remain debated. We propose a unified theoretical framework establishing that hippocampal place fields arise naturally as linear projections of grid cell population activity, interpretable as eigenmodes. Critically, we demonstrate that a frequency-dependent decay of these grid-to-place connection weights naturally transforms inputs from discrete grid modules into a continuous spectrum of place field sizes. This multiscale organization is functionally significant: we reveal it shapes the inductive bias of the population code, balancing a fundamental trade-off between precision and generalization. Mathematical analysis and simulations demonstrate an optimal place field size for few-shot learning, which scales with environment structure. Our results offer a principled explanation for the place field gradient and generate testable predictions, bridging anatomical connectivity with adaptive learning in both biological and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05320">Generalizable, real-time neural decoding with hybrid state-space models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU). These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289">Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature, \textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs (e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively. Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04379">Visualizing and Controlling Cortical Responses Using Voxel-Weighted Activation Maximization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models, our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536">NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

                arXiv:2506.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05303">Transient dynamics of associative memory models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape as shallow, unstable remnants of below-capacity stable basins. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

                arXiv:2412.12106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain-mesh model introduces a novel three-layered architecture that integrates local and macro-regional connectivity with an underlying, mesh-inspired network layer. This foundational mesh layer, based on metallic mesh structures, spans the entire brain and generates interference patterns, noise, and resonance effects that modulate both local and global neural dynamics. The fused model goes beyond traditional connectivity frameworks by providing a unified explanation for phenomena such as brain-wide phase gradients, stable low-frequency resonance frequencies, and long-range plasticity effects, which are often difficult to explain cohesively within existing models.
  In addition to accounting for classical neurobiological observations, such as phase synchrony, functional connectivity fluctuations, and local Hebbian plasticity, the model offers novel insights into less understood phenomena. Specifically, it predicts connectivity-independent phase gradients across non-synaptic regions, harmonic resonance peaks consistent across individuals, and diffuse plasticity driven by global interference patterns, all of which are challenging to explain under current frameworks.
  These unique predictions align with partial empirical observations, such as traveling wave dynamics, consistent low-frequency oscillations, and task-induced connectivity shifts, underscoring the model's relevance. Additionally, the brain-mesh model generates testable hypotheses that distinguish it from traditional approaches. This provides a promising framework for future experimental validation and opens new avenues for understanding global brain function.

                arXiv:2412.20292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-matching diffusion models can generate highly original images that lie far from their training data. However, optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches at different scales and image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.77$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.

                arXiv:2506.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model, allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms (BIAs) utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. This survey categorizes BIAs into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their core principles, strengths, and limitations. We illustrate the usage of these algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of bio-inspired computing.

                arXiv:2506.04328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the recent decades, quantum-inspired variants are known for fast and high-fitness convergence and small resource requirement. Here the application to the patient scheduling problem in proton therapy is reported. Quantum chromosomes are tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses. Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex. Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation. Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic algorithm.

                arXiv:2506.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since soft robotics are composed of compliant materials, they perform better than conventional rigid robotics in specific fields, such as medical applications. However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically, the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.

                arXiv:2506.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

                arXiv:2506.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a highly efficient method to sample from an unnormalized probability distribution. However, the SVGD update relies on gradients of the log-density, which may not always be available. Existing gradient-free versions of SVGD make use of simple Monte Carlo approximations or gradients from surrogate distributions, both with limitations. To improve gradient-free Stein variational inference, we combine SVGD steps with evolution strategy (ES) updates. Our results demonstrate that the resulting algorithm generates high-quality samples from unnormalized target densities without requiring gradient information. Compared to prior gradient-free SVGD methods, we find that the integration of the ES update in SVGD significantly improves the performance on multiple challenging benchmark problems.

">aNy-way ICA and its application to estimate cortico-thalamo-cerebellar functional links in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Multimodal data collected by international and national biobanking efforts have distinct scales and model orders and provide unique and complementary insights into disease mechanisms. We propose a novel, flexible and efficient data fusion approach, aNy-way independent component analysis (aNy-way ICA). aNy-way ICA fuses N-way multimodal or multidomain data by optimizing the entire loading correlation structure of linked components via Gaussian independent vector analysis (IVA-G) and simultaneously optimizing independence via separate ICAs. This allows for distinct model orders for different modalities/domains and multiple linked sources detection across any number of modalities or domains without requiring orthogonality constraints on sources. Simulation results demonstrate that aNy-way ICA identifies the designed sources and loadings, as well as the true covariance patterns, with improved accuracy compared to other approaches, especially under noisy conditions. Applying aNy-way ICA to fuse 4D multi-domain fMRI data in schizophrenia, we identified a cortico-thalamo-cerebellar circuit, highlighting the functional linkages among higher order thalamic nuclei, the visual cortex, default mode network, and the posterior lobe of cerebellum. Their function links were replicated in two independent datasets. The connection among higher order thalamic nuclei, the visual cortex, and default mode network discriminates schizophrenia from controls and this aberrant connection is related to multiple cognitive deficits in both discovery and replication datasets, indicating the identified cortico-thalamo-cerebellar circuit may underlie "cognitive dysmetria" in schizophrenia.

">Regulators of Interferon-Responsive Microglia Uncovered by Genome-wide CRISPRi Screening</a></h4>

              
                Microglia dynamically support brain homeostasis through the induction of specialized activation programs or states. One such program is the Interferon-Responsive Microglia state (IRM), which has been identified in developmental windows, aging, and disease. While the functional importance of this state is becoming increasingly clear, our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern IRM induction remain incomplete. To systematically identify genetic regulators of the IRM state, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in human iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Microglia) using IFIT1 as a representative IRM marker. We identified 772 genes that modulate IRM, including canonical type I interferon signaling genes (IFNAR2, TYK2, STAT1/2, USP18) and novel regulators. We uncovered a non-canonical role for the CCR4-NOT complex subunit CNOT10 in IRM activation, independent of its traditional function. This work provides a comprehensive resource for dissecting IRM biology and highlights both established and novel targets for modulating microglial interferon signaling in health and disease.

">Neural coding of spectrotemporal modulations in the auditory cortex supports speech and music categorization</a></h4>

              
                Humans effortlessly distinguish speech from music, but the neural basis of this categorization remains debated. Here, we combined intracranial recordings in humans with behavioral categorization of speech or music taken from a naturalistic movie soundtrack to test whether the encoding of spectrotemporal modulation (STM) acoustic features is sufficient to categorize the two classes. We show that primarily temporal and primarily spectral modulation patterns characterize speech and music, respectively, and that non-primary auditory regions robustly track these acoustic features over time. Critically, cortical representations of STMs predicted perceptual judgments gathered in an independent sample. Finally, speech- and music-related STM representations showed stronger tracking of category-specific acoustical features in the left versus right non-primary auditory regions, respectively. These findings support a domain-general framework for auditory categorization, such that perceptual categories emerge from efficient neural coding of low-level acoustical cues, highlighting the computational relevance of STMs in shaping auditory representations that support behavior.

">Working memory modulates auditory perceptual sensitivity during speech planning</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Working memory plays a critical role in speech production. However, how working memory influences speech systems remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate how maintaining a vowel in working memory alters perceptual sensitivity during speech planning. Method: Thirty healthy adults completed speaking and reading tasks while performing a concurrent working memory task. In speaking blocks, participants produced monosyllabic words, whereas in reading blocks, they silently read them. During each trial, participants categorized an auditory probe stimulus positioned between the vowels /{varepsilon}/ and /ae/. Trials were classified as congruent or incongruent depending on whether the vowel maintained in working memory matched the auditory target. Perceptual sensitivity and speech variability were measured across conditions. Results: In the speaking condition, participants showed higher perceptual sensitivity in congruent trials compared to incongruent trials, indicating that maintaining a vowel in working memory biased auditory target perception during speech planning. No such effect was observed in the reading condition. Additionally, participants exhibited a trend of reduced speech variability in congruent compared to incongruent trials, suggesting that working memory modulates speech outcome. No significant relationship was found between changes in perceptual sensitivity and speech variability across subjects. Conclusion: These findings suggest that maintaining a vowel in working memory shapes auditory target representations and modulates speech outcomes. This study provides novel evidence for the influence of working memory on speech systems.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors are expressed in early postnatal interneurons, but their role is enigmatic. We tested whether treatment with the GluN2C/D positive allosteric modulator CIQ and non-competitive antagonist DQP-1105 from days in vitro (DIV) 5–10 and DIV 15–20 modulates neurite growth in organotypic cultures. Calcium imaging confirmed a functional expression of GluN2D in nonpyramidal neurons. DQP treatment enhanced apical dendritic branching and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and spine density, suggesting a disinhibitory effect mirrored by a reduced expression of GAD-65, VGAT, and Syt-2. Control basket cells had larger axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs), and under CIQ, the AcDs grew even larger. The axons of CIQ-treated basket cells formed more branches within the dendritic field, and the effect was strongest for axons emerging from AcDs. DQP-treated basket cells also displayed more complex AcDs, presumably driven by enhanced network activity. However, local branching of basket cell axons was reduced under DQP in somatic axon cells but at control level in AcD cells. This suggested a growth-promoting effect of the enhanced network activity and that the AcD configuration neutralized the inhibitory action of DQP on basket cell axons. The results suggest a specific role of GluN2D signaling for development and remodeling of interneuronal axons.</span>

Older adults reconfigure more than young adults when completing goal-directed tasks with known age deficits. Less is known about task states that more closely mirror the complexity of daily life. Thus, we examined reconfiguration between rest and passive viewing of a mockumentary television show, involving richly contextualized social interactions, among young (18 to 35 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 101) and older (61 to 92 years; <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 83) adults. Then, we related reconfiguration to participants’ accurate understanding of those social interactions (theory of mind) on a novel task conducted outside of the scanner. Consistent with prior work, older adults exhibited greater cortical reconfiguration and worse theory-of-mind performance compared to young adults. Greater reconfiguration related to worse theory-of-mind performance, and the default and frontoparietal networks most strongly contributed to this association. These findings provide greater insight into how reduced neural specializations with age disrupt social cognition even in the absence of an explicit task.</span>

Gaussian causal mixture modeling was applied to characterize the genetic architecture and overlap between schizophrenia and ventricular subregion volumes phenotypes.

Our findings revealed significant, age-related differences in the left hemisphere of ASD participants compared to controls, with the RC network predominantly localized in this region. Furthermore, an interaction effect in local RC organization—though not in global RC or feeder connections—was observed between diagnostic groups and brain lateralization. Notably, rightward lateralization in local RC networks increased with age in ASD individuals, whereas it decreased with age in controls.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A mental set is a cognitive bias that results from repeatedly applying a stereotypical problem-solving strategy, which can hinder new and creative ideas. However, the neural mechanisms underlying mental set induction remain unclear. We hypothesized that repeated use of a strategy increases neural representation similarity, thus producing a mental set. To test this, we conducted representational similarity analysis across continuously presented mindset-induction trials using the same loose chunk decomposition problem-solving strategy. This induction was expected to impair the solving of subsequent probe trials requiring a more insightful tight chunk decomposition strategy. Results showed that neural representational similarity increased across loose chunk decomposition induction stages, particularly in regions related to cognitive control, mental operations, and the default mode network. These increases predicted activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal lobe during tight chunk decomposition trials. Furthermore, the medial frontal lobe moderated the impact of increased similarity during mental set induction, affecting representational changes from loose chunk decomposition to tight chunk decomposition in perceptual, operative, and executive processing regions. In summary, our findings suggest that increased neural representational similarity in goal-directed mental manipulation networks and the default mode network supports mental set induction, enhancing conflict resolution and representational change during creative problem-solving with different strategies.</span>

We found that specialization for numerical and geometric processing in parietal cortex exists by 4–8 years of age, and that children exhibited greater conjunctive activation between numerical and geometric tasks throughout the parietal cortex compared to adults. During the number line task, children’s neural activity significantly overlapped with activity from both number and geometric shape matching tasks, whereas adults’ activity only overlapped with the number task.

Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when participants performed an adapted social judgment paradigm with three stages: social feedback expectation, social feedback evaluation, and expectation updating. Behavioral analysis revealed higher acceptance expectation and lower rejection expectation in the shared positive experience (SPE) condition than in the shared negative experience (SNE) condition; receiving acceptance feedback increased acceptance expectation in the subsequent trial. EEG results revealed that at the social feedback expectation stage, rejection evoked a larger stimulus-preceding negativity magnitude than acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. At the social feedback evaluation stage, rejection feedback evoked a smaller early frontal theta than acceptance feedback in the SNE but not SPE condition; unexpected acceptance evoked a larger P300 than unexpected rejection in the SPE but not SNE condition. At the expectation updating stage, unexpected acceptance elicited larger late posterior theta than expected acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. These results suggest that shared positive experiences reduce vigilance toward impending rejection and increase sensitivity to pleasantness, whereas shared negative experiences blunt reactivity to rejection feedback and foster social learning from unexpected acceptance to enhance positive expectation.</span>

                The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally, especially in lower-middle-income countries, underscoring the need for effective public health interventions. There is limited evidence that mobile health interventions can assist in identifying the risk of NCDs in the community. Leveraging existing grassroots infrastructure, such as the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program, presents a promising opportunity to address this challenge. We developed a mHealth application to address this issue. This study protocol describes the design of a pilot study aimed at developing a mHealth application, assessing the feasibility, acceptability (barriers and facilitators), and usability to triage the risk of NCDs and pilot test it in the hands of the LHWs in Pakistan. This study consists of three phases. In phase 1, we develop a comprehensive mHealth application incorporating validated tools for NCD assessment, including the Rose Angina Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status, Risk Assessment of Pakistani Individuals for Diabetes, Global Adult Tobacco Survey, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Refined Food Frequency Questionnaire, and WHO 5 Wellness Index. Phase 2 involves qualitative focus group discussions with LHWs to refine the prototype. Phase 3 entails piloting the application with a sample of 30 LHWs in Karachi and Hyderabad, followed by qualitative exit feedback from LHWs, supervisors, healthcare providers, and community members. The outcomes will be analyzed by means, standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous data based on the normality assumption. The frequency with percentages will be registered for the categorical variables to describe the risk identifiers using the NCD tool kit. Internal consistency as validity evidence of the assessment can be determined using Cronbach’s alpha and the content validation index. If deemed feasible or acceptable, our mHealth app will address gaps in the literature and advance NCD research by identifying and improving the quality of life of people in the community in developing countries like Pakistan. The functioning and dissemination of this MHealth application can be an essential step towards highly scalable NCD data collection for a population at high risk for developing NCDs.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years, Sample range 120-3,705. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%, I2 = 99.96), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%, I2 = 99.96) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%, I2 = 99.61). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, where rice is a critical staple food, as in many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could trigger social unrest during shortages. Price control approaches are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as boosting rice stocks through imports to quickly influence market prices. Indirect controls consist of longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity for gradual stabilization. This study proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal rice import volume to minimize bi-monthly retail price fluctuations. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with seven explanatory variables: the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, GDP per capita, the price of ground dry rice (GKG) per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice distribution, and government-managed rice stock aimed at ensuring domestic availability and price stability. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum price change rates maintained between 0.75% and 1.14% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.20% to 0.34%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                <p>by Carlos A. Gomez-Uribe, Japheth Gado, Meiirbek Islamov</p>

We present a protein engineering approach to directed evolution with machine learning that integrates a new semi-supervised neural network fitness prediction model, Seq2Fitness, and an innovative optimization algorithm, biphasic annealing for diverse and adaptive sequence sampling (BADASS) to design sequences. Seq2Fitness leverages protein language models to predict fitness landscapes, combining evolutionary data with experimental labels, while BADASS efficiently explores these landscapes by dynamically adjusting temperature and mutation energies to prevent premature convergence and to generate diverse high-fitness sequences. Compared to alternative models, Seq2Fitness improves Spearman correlation with experimental fitness measurements, increasing from 0.34 to 0.55 on sequences containing mutations at positions entirely not seen during training. BADASS requires less memory and computation compared to gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, while generating more high-fitness and diverse sequences across two protein families. For both families, 100% of the top 10,000 sequences identified by BADASS exceed the wildtype in predicted fitness, whereas competing methods range from 3% to 99%, often producing far fewer than 10,000 sequences. BADASS also finds higher-fitness sequences at every cutoff (top 1, 100, and 10,000). Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework explaining BADASS’s underlying mechanism and behavior. While we focus on amino acid sequences, BADASS may generalize to other sequence spaces, such as DNA and RNA.

Neuronal regeneration in the adult brain, which is restricted compared to that in the embryonic brain, is a long-standing topic in neuroscience and medical research. Based on studies in mammals, a small number of newly generated immature neurons (neuroblasts) migrate toward damaged sites and contribute to functional recovery. During migration, neuroblasts form chain-like collectives and modify the morphology of glial cells (astrocytes), which are the main components of the surrounding environment. However, it remains unclear how neuroblasts form collectives and how efficient migration is achieved through collective formation in a pool of astrocytes. The main difficulty lies in tracking individual neuroblasts within the collective, both in vitro and in vivo, over a period. To address this impasse, we built a mathematical model of the neuroblast-astrocyte system to assess its long-term performance in silico. Our simulations showed that individual neuroblasts gathered into chain-like collectives through occasional contact, astrocyte confinement, and moderate adhesion between the neuroblasts. The forward movement of neuroblasts in an astrocyte-dense environment was accelerated if we assumed a simple interaction: the higher the number of neuroblasts near an astrocyte, the stronger the shrinkage of astrocytic protrusions. Furthermore, temporal changes in neuroblast behavior, as indicated by our observation of living neuroblasts in culture, reinforce the advantages of simulated collectives. A collective of neuroblasts with constant behavior sometimes repeated non-migratory movements, whereas those with inconstant behavior were easily untangled, resulting in a rapid migration. These results highlight the potential for neuroblast collectivity and inconstancy in enhancing neuronal regeneration in the adult brain.

tRNA halves are among the most abundant short non-coding RNAs in the cellular transcriptome. Here we report that in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the hormone-dependent 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half promoted cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression. Global mRNA profiling upon the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half depletion revealed that the mRNA of p21, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, is post-transcriptionally destabilized via a 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half-driven mechanism. YBX1, identified as a protein interacting with 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half in the cytosol, was shown to stabilize p21 mRNA. Specific sequences resembling the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half, located in the 3′-UTR of p21 mRNA and termed LL588, were identified as the binding site for YBX1 and are required for p21 mRNA stability. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half is capable of displacing YBX1 from LL588. Collectively, our findings suggest that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half directly binds to and displaces YBX1 from p21 mRNA, leading to the destabilization of p21 mRNA and the promotion of cell cycle progression in hormone-dependent cancers. Our study illuminates the role of tRNA halves in regulating mRNA stability and suggests that this may be part of broader regulatory networks affecting mRNA levels, orchestrated by various tRNA halves and their interacting proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003186">Embodiment of an artificial limb in mice</a></h4>

Body ownership disorders can be triggered by disease or body damage. Methods to probe limb embodiment are required to address those disorders. This includes the development of neuroprostheses that better integrate into the body scheme of the user. To this end, the “rubber hand illusion” protocol is a key behavioral method to probe the powerful embodiment that can be triggered by congruent somatosensory and visual inputs from the limb. So far, the neurophysiology of limb embodiment remains poorly known, in part because translating the rubber hand illusion to animal models such as the mouse remains challenging. Yet, mapping out the brain circuits of embodiment thanks to the use of genetic and optogenetic research tools would allow to propose novel embodiment restoration strategies. Here, we show that the rubber hand illusion described in humans can be translated to the mouse forelimb model using an automated, videography-based procedure. We exposed head-fixed mice to a visible, static 3D-printed replica of the right forelimb, while their own forelimb was hidden from their sight. We synchronously brushed their hidden forelimb and the replica. Following these visuo-tactile associations, the replica was visually threatened, and we probed the reaction of the mice using automated tracking of pupils and facial expression. The mice focused significantly more of their gaze toward the threatened forelimb replica after receiving synchronous tactile and visual information compared to asynchronous. More generally, across test and control conditions, the mouse pupillary response was consistent with the human overt response to the rubber hand illusion. Thus, our results show that mice exhibit quantifiable behavioral markers of the embodiment of an artificial forelimb.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003180">Sensory stimuli dominate over rhythmic electrical stimulation in modulating behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuranny Cabral-Calderin, Molly J. Henry</p>

Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, <i>N</i> = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, <i>N</i> = 24; Experiment 3, <i>N</i> = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 17 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individual’s preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003174">Neural evidence that humans reuse strategies to solve new tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sam Hall-McMaster, Momchil S. Tomov, Samuel J. Gershman, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Generalization from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, one efficient computational approach is to evaluate solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (<i>n</i> = 38) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and generalized them to novel test tasks in a reward-selective manner. This behavior was consistent with a computational process based on the successor representation known as successor features and generalized policy improvement (SF&GPI). Neither model-free perseveration or model-based control using a complete model of the environment could explain choice behavior. Decoding from functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that solutions from the SF&GPI algorithm were activated on test tasks in visual and prefrontal cortex. This activation had a functional connection to behavior in that stronger activation of SF&GPI solutions in visual areas was associated with increased behavioral reuse. These findings point to a possible neural implementation of an adaptive algorithm for generalization across tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27277?af=R">HCN2‐Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Data from Patients and Xenopus Cell Models</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

                ABC transporters modulate lipid homeostasis and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In a recent study, Chen et al. uncovered unexpected dual roles for the Drosophila ABCA protein eater of debris (Eato), which suppresses phospholipid exposure in both neurons and phagocytes, conferring opposite functional outcomes in each cell type. This challenges classical models of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter function and reveals new mechanisms by which lipid signaling regulates neuron–glia interactions in neurodegenerative contexts.

                Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a modifiable protective lifestyle factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study by Kim and colleagues, higher levels of PA were associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) 217 concentrations even after accounting for β-amyloid (Aβ) brain uptake, suggesting a link with tau pathophysiology; this link also mediated better general cognition.

                In a recent study, Thakur and O’Connor-Giles identified PDZD8 as a novel regulator of activity-dependent synaptic growth in Drosophila. Localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–late endosome/lysosome (LEL) membrane contact sites (MCSs), PDZD8 promotes autophagy by coupling lipid transfer to autolysosome maturation to drive synaptic bouton formation, providing in vivo evidence that autophagy contributes directly to synaptic remodeling.

                Dijkstra et al. show that our brain distinguishes imagination from reality by monitoring how strongly the fusiform gyrus is activated. When imagined and real images produce similar activity, people can confuse them. This helps explain how we normally tell what is real—and why that sometimes fails.

                Wang et al. identify phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as a negative regulator of pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation, contrary to other glycolytic enzymes. PGAM inhibition suppresses a regulatory program in non-pathogenic Th17 cells. Inhibiting PGAM in Th17 cells exacerbates autoimmune responses in an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

                Bastille and colleagues demonstrate that two closely related transcription factors, c-Maf and Mafb, have both redundant and independent effects on the diversification and functional differentiation of peripheral auditory neurons. Their data suggest that varying combinations of c-Maf and Mafb generate nuanced differences in synaptic structure and function.

                Swaro et al. use spatial transcriptomics to investigate cell-type-specific dysregulation following TBI. TBI-associated changes are found at both broad spatial scales and within specific brain regions and cell types. These findings deconstruct the multiscale complexity of TBI and will aid future studies through a public web portal.

                Chen et al. revealed that drought and ABA induce the expression of the heavy-metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein gene HIPP26L and promote its nuclear translocation via interactions with NF-YC9 in poplar. In the nucleus, the HIPP26L-NF-YC9-SRMT ternary complex enhances the expression of stress-responsive genes, thereby activating the drought response.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 05 June 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01957-8">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-01957-8</a></p>Despite the loss of neurons during aging and the early stages of neurodegenerative disease, many cortical brain functions remain remarkably intact. Although this resilience is traditionally attributed to redundancy in neural networks, a new study uncovers a more active mechanism: dynamic homeostatic processes that preserve cortical representations in the face of neuronal loss. These processes recruit previously unengaged neurons and rearrange neuronal activity patterns to compensate for neuronal loss and maintain the integrity of representational maps in the brain.

This study shows that key RNA pathways are disrupted in old neurons, including splicing and the stress response. Because of these changes, the aging brain has reduced resilience to new stress, which might predispose old neurons to disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94586">Overflow metabolism originates from growth optimization and cell heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                A classic problem in metabolism is that fast-proliferating cells use seemingly wasteful fermentation for energy biogenesis in the presence of sufficient oxygen. This counterintuitive phenomenon, known as overflow metabolism or the Warburg effect, is universal across various organisms. Despite extensive research, its origin and function remain unclear. Here, we show that overflow metabolism can be understood through growth optimization combined with cell heterogeneity. A model of optimal protein allocation, coupled with heterogeneity in enzyme catalytic rates among cells, quantitatively explains why and how cells choose between respiration and fermentation under different nutrient conditions. Our model quantitatively illustrates the growth rate dependence of fermentation flux and enzyme allocation under various perturbations and is fully validated by experimental results in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Our work provides a quantitative explanation for the Crabtree effect in yeast and the Warburg effect in cancer cells and can be broadly used to address heterogeneity-related challenges in metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95127">Uncertainty-modulated prediction errors in cortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the variability of the environment is essential to function in everyday life. The brain must hence take uncertainty into account when updating its internal model of the world. The basis for updating the model are prediction errors that arise from a difference between the current model and new sensory experiences. Although prediction error neurons have been identified in layer 2/3 of diverse brain areas, how uncertainty modulates these errors and hence learning is, however, unclear. Here, we use a normative approach to derive how uncertainty should modulate prediction errors and postulate that layer 2/3 neurons represent uncertainty-modulated prediction errors (UPE). We further hypothesise that the layer 2/3 circuit calculates the UPE through the subtractive and divisive inhibition by different inhibitory cell types. By implementing the calculation of UPEs in a microcircuit model, we show that different cell types can compute the means and variances of the stimulus distribution. With local activity-dependent plasticity rules, these computations can be learned context-dependently, and allow the prediction of upcoming stimuli and their distribution. Finally, the mechanism enables an organism to optimise its learning strategy via adaptive learning rates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100280">Location- and feature-based selection histories make independent, qualitatively distinct contributions to urgent visuomotor performance</a></h4>

              
                Attention mechanisms guide visuomotor behavior by weighing physical salience and internal goals to prioritize stimuli as choices for action. Although less well studied, selection history, which reflects multiple facets of experience with recent events, is increasingly recognized as a distinct source of attentional bias. To examine how selection history impacts saccadic choices, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform an urgent version of an oddball search task in which a red target appeared among three green distracters or vice versa. By imposing urgency, performance could be tracked continuously as it transitioned from uninformed guesses to informed choices as a function of processing time. This, in turn, permitted assessment of attentional control as manifest in motor biases, processing speed, and asymptotic accuracy. Here, we found that the probability of making a correct choice was strongly modulated by the histories of preceding target locations and target colors. Crucially, although both effects were gated by success (or reward), their dynamics were clearly distinct: whereas location history promoted a motor bias, color history modulated perceptual sensitivity, and these influences acted independently. Thus, combined selection histories can give rise to enormous swings in visuomotor performance even in simple tasks with highly discriminable stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89170">Dynamical mechanisms of growth-feedback effects on adaptive gene circuits</a></h4>

              
                The successful integration of engineered gene circuits into host cells remains a significant challenge in synthetic biology due to circuit–host interactions, such as growth feedback, where the circuit influences cell growth and vice versa. Understanding the dynamics of circuit failures and identifying topologies resilient to growth feedback are crucial for both fundamental and applied research. Utilizing transcriptional regulation circuits with adaptation as a paradigm, we systematically study more than 400 topological structures and uncover various categories of failures. Three dynamical mechanisms of circuit failures are identified: continuous deformation of the response curve, strengthened or induced oscillations, and sudden switching to coexisting attractors. Our extensive computations also uncover a scaling law between a circuit robustness measure and the strength of growth feedback. Despite the negative effects of growth feedback on the majority of circuit topologies, we identify several circuits that maintain optimal performance as designed, a feature important for applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100123">Imaging of brain electric field networks with spatially resolved EEG</a></h4>

              
                We present a method for spatially resolving the electric field potential throughout the entire volume of the human brain from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The method is <i>not</i> a variation of the well-known ‘source reconstruction’ methods, but rather a direct solution to the EEG inverse problem based on our recently developed model for brain waves that demonstrates the inadequacy of the standard ‘quasi-static approximation’ that has fostered the belief that such a reconstruction is not physically possible. The method retains the high temporal/frequency resolution of EEG, yet has spatial resolution comparable to (or better than) functional MRI (fMRI), without its significant inherent limitations. The method is validated using simultaneous EEG/fMRI data in healthy subjects, intracranial EEG data in epilepsy patients, comparison with numerical simulations, and a direct comparison with standard state-of-the-art EEG analysis in a well-established attention paradigm. The method is then demonstrated on a very large cohort of subjects performing a standard gambling task designed to activate the brain’s ‘reward circuit’. The technique uses the output from standard extant EEG systems and thus has potential for immediate benefit to a broad range of important basic scientific and clinical questions concerning brain electrical activity. By offering an inexpensive and portable alternative to fMRI, it provides a realistic methodology to efficiently promote the democratization of medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101769">Context-dependent modulations of subthalamo-cortical synchronization during rapid reversals of movement direction in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                The role of beta band activity in cortico-basal ganglia interactions during motor control has been studied extensively in resting-state and for simple movements, such as button pressing. However, little is known about how beta oscillations change and interact in more complex situations involving rapid changes of movement in various contexts. To close this knowledge gap, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson’s disease patients to study beta dynamics during initiation, stopping, and rapid reversal of rotational movements. The action prompts were manipulated to be predictable vs. unpredictable. We observed movement-related beta suppression at motor sequence start, and a beta rebound after motor sequence stop in STN power, motor cortical power, and STN-cortex coherence. Despite involving a brief stop of movement, no clear rebound was observed during reversals of turning direction. At the cortical level, beta power decreased bilaterally following reversals, but more so in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, due to a floor effect on the contralateral side. In the STN, power modulations varied across patients, with patients displaying brief increases or decreases of high-beta power. Importantly, cue predictability affected these modulations. Event-related increases of STN-cortex beta coherence were generally stronger in the unpredictable than in the predictable condition. In summary, this study reveals the influence of movement context on beta oscillations in basal ganglia-cortex loops when humans change ongoing movements according to external cues. We find that movement scenarios requiring higher levels of caution involve enhanced modulations of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization. Furthermore, our results confirm that beta oscillations reflect the start and end of motor sequences better than movement changes within a sequence.

                Oxidative phosphorylation has emerged as a critical therapeutic vulnerability of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>). However, it is unknown how intracellular bacterial pathogens such as <i>Mtb</i> maintain respiration during infection despite the chemical effectors of host immunity. <i>Mtb</i> synthesizes diisonitrile lipopeptides that tightly chelate copper, but the role of these chalkophores in host-pathogen interactions is also unknown. We demonstrate that <i>M. tuberculosis</i> chalkophores maintain the function of the heme-copper <i>bcc:aa<sub>3</sub></i> respiratory supercomplex under copper limitation. Chalkophore deficiency impairs <i>Mtb</i> survival, respiration to oxygen, and ATP production under copper deprivation in culture, effects that are exacerbated by loss of the heme-dependent Cytochrome BD respiratory oxidase. Our genetic analyses indicate that the maintenance of respiration is the major cellular target of chalkophore-mediated copper acquisition. <i>M. tuberculosis</i> lacking chalkophore biosynthesis is attenuated in mice, a phenotype that is also severely exacerbated by loss of the CytBD respiratory oxidase. We find that the host immune pressure that attenuates chalkophore-deficient <i>Mtb</i> is independent of adaptive immunity and neutrophils. These data demonstrate that chalkophores counter host-inflicted copper deprivation and highlight a multilayered system by which <i>M. tuberculosis</i> maintains respiration during infection.

">Training-induced alterations in the modulation of human motoneuron discharge patterns with contraction force</a></h4>

              
                Motoneurons adapt to both resistance and endurance training in reduced animal preparations, with adaptations seemingly more apparent in higher threshold neurons, but similar evidence in humans is lacking. Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces ([&ge;]50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance- compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.

">Cell-surface proteomic profiling identifies CD72 as a regulator of microglial tiling</a></h4>

              
                Microglial tiling-- the phenomenon of consistent cell-to-cell distances and non-overlapping processes-- is regarded as a qualitative indicator of homeostasis, but mechanisms of microglial tiling are unknown. We used cell-surface proximity labeling and mass spectrometry to profile the microglial cell-surface proteome in an in vitro model of homeostatic glial physiology and used single-cell RNA sequencing and public databases to identify candidate cell-surface proteins that might modulate tiling. We designed an image-based functional assay which measures six morphological/spatial readouts to screen these proteins for modulation of tiling. CD72, a coreceptor to the B cell receptor that is expressed by microglia, disrupted tiling; we validated its effects in vitro and in situ in organotypic hippocampal brain slices. Phosphoproteomic studies revealed that CD72 modulates pathways associated with cell adhesion, repulsive receptors, microglial activation, and cytoskeletal organization. These results lay the groundwork for further investigation of the functional roles of tiling in homeostasis and disease.

">Chronic benzodiazepine treatment triggers gephyrin scaffold destabilization and GABAAR subsynaptic reorganization</a></h4>

              
                Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are important clinical drugs with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative effects mediated by potentiation of inhibitory GABA type A receptors (GABAARs). Tolerance limits the clinical utility of BZDs, yet the mechanisms underlying tolerance after chronic exposure have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we assessed the impact of chronic (7-day) treatment with the BZD diazepam (DZP) on the dynamic plasticity and subsynaptic organization of the gephyrin scaffold and {gamma} subunit-containing GABAARs in primary neurons. After functional confirmation of diminished BZD sensitivity, we provide the first super-resolution analysis of inhibitory nanoscale plasticity induced by chronic BZD exposure: gephyrin subsynaptic domains were smaller and the inhibitory postsynaptic area was overall diminished by DZP treatment, resulting in a condensation of synaptic {gamma}2-GABAARs into smaller subsynaptic areas. Using a novel fluorescence-based in situ proximity ligation assay and biochemical fractionation analysis, the mechanism for gephyrin downregulation was revealed to be dependent on phosphorylation and protease cleavage. Accordingly, DZP treatment impaired gephyrin synaptic stability, demonstrated by live-imaging photobleaching experiments. Despite the loss of BZD sensitivity and stable synaptic gephyrin, 7-day DZP treatment did not reduce the surface or total protein levels of BZD-sensitive {gamma}2-GABAARs, as shown in prior short-term BZD treatment studies. Instead, chronic DZP treatment induced an accumulation of {gamma}2-GABAARs in the extrasynaptic membrane. Surprisingly, {gamma}2-GABAAR interactions with gephyrin were also enriched extrasynaptically. An identified rise in extrasynaptically-localized gephyrin cleavage fragments may function to confine receptors away from the synapse, as supported by a decrease in extrasynaptic {gamma}2-GABAAR mobility. Altogether, we find that chronic BZD treatment triggers several subtle converging plasticity events at inhibitory synapses which effectively restrict the synaptic renewal of BZD-sensitive GABAARs via mechanisms distinct from those observed with short-term treatment.

">Oxytocin release modulates acute neuroinflammation and improves brain development after pediatric traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability early in life in infants, and its neurodevelopmental consequences cannot currently be effectively treated. Since TBI is associated with neuroinflammation, modulation of the post-injury neuroinflammatory response is a promising strategy. Oxytocin is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties and appears to play a role in clinical interventions that improve brain development in neonates. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, as does its applicability in acute brain injury. Here we investigate the effects of chemogenetic modulation of endogenous oxytocin on acute neuroinflammation and on long-term brain development after TBI in postnatal day 7 (P7) male mice. We show that oxytocin release attenuates the acute neuroinflammatory response to TBI 24 hours after injury, by reducing the expression of immune- and inflammation-related genes in astrocytes and promoting gene pathways for brain repair and development in microglia. In the long term, oxytocin exposure ameliorates subcortical and cortical white matter damage after TBI, prevents hyperactivity and loss of social behavior, and restores TBI-induced alterations in resting-state functional connectivity of the isocortex. These findings enhance our understanding of the modulation of neuroinflammation and its long-term effects and support intervention related to endogenous oxytocin release as a promising neuroprotective strategy in pediatric TBI.

">Dissecting surveying behavior of reactive microglia under chronic neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.

">Increased circulating TREM2+ microglia extracellular vesicles in aged APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease rats</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: TREM2 is a microglial marker important in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but current methods to detect microglial TREM2 expression in vivo are limited. Circulating microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) show promise as potential biomarkers for AD and may offer insight into TREM2 activity. Methods: TMEM119+/TREM2+ EVs were assessed using nanoscale flow cytometry in plasma from wildtype and APP/PS1 rats aged to 3-. 9-, and 15-months-old. Molecular and histological assays were used to assess microglia markers in rat brain tissue and a radial arm water maze task was employed to evaluate spatial working and reference memory. Results: Circulating TMEM119+/TREM2+ EVs were increased in 15-month APP/PS1 rats and associated with severity of cognitive impairment. TREM2 brain expression varied by anatomical region, age, transgene, and assay. Discussion: Collectively, this study provides the first assessment of TMEM119+?Tremem2+ EVs as a biomarker of brain microglia expression and cognition in an AD rat model.

">LOSS OF ARGINASE 2 DISRUPTS STRIATUM-SPECIFIC POLYAMINE HOMEOSTASIS</a></h4>

              
                Arginase converts arginine (Arg) to ornithine (Orn), regulating their availability for the metabolic pathways that utilize these amino acids. The roles of arginase isoenzymes, Arg1 and Arg2, vary by cell type, tissue, and physiological state. In the brain, Arg2 is the predominant isoenzyme, particularly enriched in the striatum, where it localizes to a striatum-specific neuronal population - medium spiny neurons (MSNs). While the precise role of Arg2 in MSNs remains unclear, its loss alters the striatal metabolomic profile, highlighting its metabolic significance. Here, to investigate the basis of these complex metabolic changes, we examined Arg metabolism in Arg2 knockout (Arg2-/-) mice. Targeted analysis of Arg-related metabolites and selected proteins regulating Arg metabolic pathways revealed that Arg2 loss significantly increased Arg levels but did not affect Orn, likely due to compensatory synthesis of Orn from Arg (via arginine:glycine amidinotransferase) and/or proline (via ornithine aminotransferase). Additionally, markers of nitric oxide (NO) production remained unchanged, suggesting that striatal Arg2 is not involved in the regulation of this pathway, a role commonly attributed to arginase. Most notably, Arg2 loss disrupted polyamine homeostasis, shifting the balance toward higher polyamines at the expense of lower ones and altering the expression of polyamine-regulating proteins. These findings highlight Arg2 crucial role in striatal metabolism and its potential relevance to striatum-related disorders. Given that striatal Arg2 impairment has been reported in Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder specifically affecting MSNs, understanding its function may provide insights into the pathology.

">Neural Tracking of Audiovisual Effects in Noise Using Deep Neural Network-Generated Virtual Humans</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the effectiveness of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-generated virtual humans in enhancing audiovisual speech perception in noisy environments, with a focus on using neural measures to quantify these effects. Lip movements are essential for speech comprehension, especially when auditory cues are degraded by noise. Traditional recording methods produce high-quality audiovisual materials but are resource intensive. This research explores the use of DNN avatars as a promising alternative, utilizing a commercially available tool to create realistic virtual humans. The study included both simple sentences and a short story to improve ecological validity. Eleven young, normal-hearing participants proficient in Flemish-Dutch listened to semantically meaningful sentences and a short story with various speaker types: a female FACS avatar, male and female DNN avatars, and a video of a human male speaker. The study included behavioral measures which consisted of an adaptive recall procedure and an adaptive rate procedure and electrophysiological measures consisting of neural tracking. Findings in the adaptive recall procedure showed consistent audiovisual benefits, with the human speaker offering the greatest benefit (-4.75 dB SNR), followed by the DNN avatar (-4.00 dB SNR) and the FACS avatar (-1.55 dB SNR). Additionally in the adaptive rate procedure, the DNN avatar improved speech intelligibility, with average SRTs enhancing from -7.17 dB SNR (audio-only) to -9.02 dB SNR (audiovisual). The results from the neural tracking procedure indicated that most participants experienced audiovisual benefits, particularly in the -9 dB SNR range, revealing that audiovisual cues provided by DNN avatars can enhance speech perception, validating these avatars as effective tools for studying audiovisual effects when using both behavioral measures and electrophysiological measures.

">Brain-Penetrating Peptide and Antibody Radioligands for Proof-of-Concept PET Imaging of Fibrin in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial disorder with vascular contributions, including a pro-coagulant state marked by fibrin deposition in the brain. Fibrin accumulation may exacerbate cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to neurodegeneration. Identifying patients with this pathology could enable targeted anticoagulant therapy. However, current imaging tools lack the specificity and sensitivity to detect fibrin in the brain. This study aimed to develop and evaluate brain-penetrating peptide- and antibody-based PET radioligands targeting fibrin to enable individualized treatment strategies in AD. Results: A fibrin-binding peptide (FBP) was conjugated to the antibody fragment scFv8D3, which targets the transferrin receptor (TfR), to facilitate transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. FBP-scFv8D3 bound TfR and with modest affinity to fibrin, though with limited selectivity over fibrinogen. In vivo studies in Tg-ArcSwe mice, that exhibit fibrin along with brain amyloid-{beta} pathology, and wild-type mice showed that [125I]FBP-scFv8D3 retained brain-penetrating properties but did not demonstrate significant fibrin-specific retention. In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 1101 and its bispecific, brain penetrant variant 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited high fibrin selectivity and TfR binding. Both antibodies showed a trend towards higher brain retention in Tg-ArcSwe mice and [125I]1101-scFv8D3 showed a higher brain-to-blood ratio compared to [124I]1101. PET imaging with [124I]1101 and [124I]1101-scFv8D3 revealed low brain uptake but ex vivo autoradiography suggested specific cortical retention in Tg-ArcSwe mice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using bispecific antibody-based PET radioligands to target fibrin in the AD brain. While the FBP-scFv8D3 conjugate showed limited specificity, the bispecific antibody 1101-scFv8D3 exhibited promising brain penetration and fibrin selectivity. These findings support further development of antibody-based imaging tools toward the goal to stratify AD patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy.

">Kv2/Kv6.4 heteromeric potassium channels are expressed in spinal motor neurons and localized at C-bouton synapses</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated K+ channels of the Kv2 family co-assemble with electrically silent KvS subunits in specific subpopulations of brain neurons, forming heteromeric Kv2/KvS channels with distinct functional properties. Little is known about the composition and function of Kv2 channels in spinal cord neurons, however. Here, we show that while Kv2.1 is broadly expressed in multiple classes of spinal cord neurons, the Kv6.4 electrically-silent subunit is specifically expressed in motor neurons. In motor neurons, we find that Kv6.4 protein is co-clustered with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 subunits at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions beneath C-bouton synapses. In Kv2.1 S590A mutant mice, in which Kv2.1 is unable to bind ER VAP proteins, Kv2.1 and Kv6.4 clustering at ER-PM junctions is severely reduced suggesting Kv2 channels are localized at ER-PM junctions by the same molecular mechanism in motor neurons and brain neurons. Moreover, clustering of Kv6.4, as well as the AMIGO-1 auxiliary subunit, are severely reduced in Kv2.1 knockout mice and moderately reduced in Kv2.2 knockout mice. Thus, expression and localization of Kv6.4 subunits is dependent on Kv2 subunits, likely through their co-assembly into heteromeric channels. Finally, we find that presynaptic C-boutons and postsynaptic clusters of the ER-resident sigma1-receptor are preserved in motor neurons of Kv2 knockout mice. Together, these findings identify a specific Kv2/KvS channel subtype expressed in motor neurons that localizes to C-bouton junctions where it could regulate neuronal excitability and signaling at ER-PM junctions.

">The Cerebellum and Striatum in Reward Processing: Caring About Being Right vs. Caring About Reward</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence indicates the cerebellum contributes to cognitive functions including social reward processing, yet its specific role relative to established reward regions like the ventral striatum remains undefined. We hypothesized the cerebellum would respond equivalently to both positive and negative social rewards. This prediction is grounded in classical findings that the cerebellum operates via supervised learning mechanisms that rely on error signals rather than traditional reward-based reinforcement. Using fMRI, we examined adolescents and young adults during a social prediction task where participants forecasted others' opinions of them and received accuracy feedback. Findings reveal that both the ventral striatum and a subregion of the posterior cerebellum (Crus I and II) were sensitive to social rewards. However, unlike the ventral striatum, the cerebellum exhibited a more uniform response to feedback, treating correct predictions about being liked and disliked in a similar manner. No age-related differences were observed. These findings suggest the cerebellum processes social rewards distinctly from the ventral striatum, likely reflecting its computational emphasis on prediction errors rather than reward valence. This functional distinction advances our understanding of cerebellar contributions to social cognition and learning mechanisms.

">Prediction, Syntax and Semantic Grounding in the Brain and Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension involves continuous prediction of upcoming words, with syntactic structure and semantic meaning intertwined in the human brain. To date, few studies have used combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to investigate how syntactic processing, predictive coding, and semantic grounding interact in real time. Here we present the first combined MEG-EEG investigation of syntactic processing and semantic grounding under naturalistic conditions. Twenty-nine healthy participants listened to a German audio book while their neural responses were recorded. Event-related fields and event-related potentials for four word classes - nouns, verbs, adjectives, and proper nouns - showed highly reproducible, characteristic spatio-temporal signatures, including significant pre-onset activity for nouns, suggesting enhanced predictability of this word class. Source-space analyses revealed pronounced activation in the pre- and post-central gyri for nouns, suggesting a deeper semantic grounding of nouns in e.g. sensory experiences than verbs. To further investigate predictive mechanisms, we analyzed the hidden representations of the large language model Llama. By comparing the transformer-based representations to neural responses, we explored the relationship between computational language models and human brain activity, offering new insights into syntactic and semantic prediction. These findings highlight the power of simultaneous MEG-EEG recordings in unraveling the predictive, syntactic, and semantic mechanisms that underlie the comprehension of natural language.

">A High-Resolution Atlas of the Brain Predicts Lineage and Birth Order Underly Neuronal Identity.</a></h4>

              
                Gene expression shapes the nervous system at every biological level, from molecular and cellular processes defining neuronal identity and function to systems-level wiring and circuit dynamics underlying behaviour. Here, we generate the first high-resolution, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult Drosophila melanogaster central brain by integrating multiple datasets, achieving an unprecedented tenfold coverage of every neuron in this complex tissue. We show that a neuron's genetic identity overwhelmingly reflects its developmental origin, preserving a genetic address based on both lineage and birth order. We reveal foundational rules linking neurogenesis to transcriptional identity and provide a framework for systematically defining neuronal types. This atlas provides a powerful resource for mapping the cellular substrates of behaviour by integrating annotations of hemilineage, cell types/subtypes and molecular signatures of underlying physiological properties. It lays the groundwork for a long-sought bridge between developmental processes and the functional circuits that give rise to behaviour.

">Receptor-enriched analysis of functional connectivity (REACT) for understanding cannabinoid neuropsychopharmacology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis is one of the most widely used psychoactive substances in the world and is increasingly investigated as a treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions. Cannabis contains delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is thought to underlie its main psychoactive effects, and cannabidiol (CBD), which has been proposed to modulate the effects of THC on the brain. Both have activity at CB1 receptors, whilst THC also binds to CB2 receptors. However, it is unclear how THC's effects on brain function are related to cannabinoid receptors, or how CBD co-administration affects this. We aimed to investigate the effects of vaporised THC and the moderating effects of CBD on CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity. Methods: Forty-eight participants (24 adolescents and 24 adults) who used cannabis 0.5-3 days/week (mean=1.5 days/week) participated in a randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind experiment where they inhaled vaporised cannabis containing either THC-only (8mg/75kg person), THC+CBD (8 mg THC + 24mg CBD/75kg person) or no psychoactive compounds (placebo). Resting-state functional MRI data were collected approximately 50 minutes post-administration. Receptor distribution maps were derived from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for CB1 receptors and the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) for CB2 receptors. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of Connectivity by Targets (REACT) analytical methodology was used to investigate changes in functional connectivity related to specific receptor targets. Results: Inhalation of both THC-only and THC+CBD cannabis induced significant decreases in CB1 and CB2 receptor-enriched functional connectivity compared to placebo. The THC+CBD condition showed more extensive reductions than THC-only cannabis for both CB1- and CB2-enriched functional connectivity, affecting regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen. Higher THC plasma levels were associated with greater decreases in functional connectivity in the THC+CBD condition. Exploratory analyses identified significant positive and negative relationships between subjective drug effects and receptor-enriched functional connectivity in a region-dependent manner. Conclusions: Cannabis with and without CBD decreased resting-state functional connectivity in networks associated with CB1 and CB2 receptor distribution. Co-administration of CBD with THC appears to enhance these effects. The REACT analytical methodology identified changes in CB1- and CB2-enriched functional connectivity are related to THC and CBD plasma levels as well as subjective drug effects across a range of regions.

                <p>Adaptive behavior in complex environments requires integrating visual perception with memory of our spatial environment. Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex&mdash;the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs)&ndash;in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1&ndash;2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared with public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.</p>

                <p>Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE), a rare autosomal recessively inherited metabolic disease, results from mutations in ALDH7A1, a gene crucial for lysine metabolism. Although early high-dose pyridoxine treatment can control seizures, ~75% of PDE patients still have intellectual disabilities. In this study, we test the hypothesis of substrate reduction therapy for PDE by genetically perturbing lysine &alpha;-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR), an enzyme upstream of the defective ALDH7A1, in male and female laboratory mice. A homozygous mutation in LKR completely abolishes the accumulation of toxic lysine catabolism intermediates (&alpha;-aminoadipic--semialdehyde and its cyclic form, -1-piperideine-6-carboxylate), ends the epileptic state, and restores the defective brain development and cognitive impairments in ALDH7A1-deficient mice. Therefore, these genetic data prove the concept of the effectiveness of substrate reduction therapy for PDE via LKR inhibition.</p>

                <p>Voluntary movement control depends on plasticity in several interconnected brain regions, including the cerebellum (CB), primary motor cortex (M1), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). It is thought that one role of the CB is to regulate communication between PPC and M1, but causal evidence for this regulatory role in humans remains lacking. Here, we evaluated how transiently altering activity in CB via intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) affects PPC&ndash;M1 connectivity and plasticity by assessing the effectiveness of subsequent Hebbian-like cortical paired associative stimulation (cPAS) to PPC and M1. Using a within-subject design, we administered four different single-session stimulation conditions to the CB and parietal&ndash;motor pathway of the motor network and measured the aftereffects on plasticity (both sexes). We administered iTBS to the right CB or right visual cortex, followed by cPAS of a parietal&ndash;motor circuit in the left hemisphere. In a subset of participants, we performed two additional control conditions to assess the effect of CB iTBS alone and Hebbian-like cPAS of the PPC&ndash;M1 circuit alone. We evaluated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation as a measure of motor cortical excitability before and after each plasticity induction protocol. Cerebellar iTBS reduced cPAS-induced plasticity in the parietal&ndash;motor circuit, as evidenced by a decrease in MEPs. These responses were selective, as no decreases in excitability were observed during the control experiments. These findings suggest that CB activity can modify distal neural activity in a network-connected parietal&ndash;motor circuit through heterosynaptic metaplasticity.</p>

                <p>Damage to retinal cells from disease or injury causes vision loss and remodeling of downstream visual information processing circuits. As retinal cell replacement therapies and prosthetics become increasingly viable, we must understand the postretinal consequences of retinal cell loss to optimally recover visual perception. Here, we asked whether loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) differentially impacts postsynaptic neurons in the visual thalamus&mdash;the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)&mdash;of ferrets, highly visual carnivores. We hypothesized that RGC loss might impact X more than Y LGN neurons, as there is less divergence in X retinogeniculate connections. We induced excitotoxic lesions of RGCs in a single eye and recorded neurophysiological responses of both contra- and ipsilesional LGN neurons to a variety of visual stimuli. We observed loss of responses among many LGN neurons, presumably with receptive fields within the scotoma. We also observed contralesional LGN neurons with receptive fields within or at the border of the scotoma that responded consistently to drifting sinusoidal gratings and spatiotemporally dynamic stimuli, enabling their classification as X or Y cells. Contralesional Y cell responses remained intact while contralesional X cells demonstrated higher firing rates, altered tuning to stimulus contrast and temporal frequency, and reduced spike timing precision. Consistent with neurophysiological results, alpha RGCs appeared relatively spared compared with beta RGCs. Together, our findings show that retinal cell loss differentially impacts downstream neuronal circuits, suggesting that supplemental vision recovery therapies may need to target visual circuits specialized for acuity vision.</p>

Interruption of projection neurons from Rh to rmCD had little effect on already learned stimulus&ndash;reward associations but impaired the learning of new associations. The learning impairment appeared when the projection neurons from the perirhinal cortex (PRh) to rmCD were silenced using microinjections of deschloroclozapine into PRh. The pathway-specific silencing led to a significant deficit in learning new stimulus&ndash;reward associations. These results suggest that the learning, but not retrieval, of visual stimulus&ndash;reward associations involves projection neurons from PRh to rmCD.</p>

                <p>Aligning one's decisions with the prevailing social norms and expectations of those around us constitutes a fundamental facet of moral decision-making. When faced with conflicting moral values, one adaptive approach is to rely on intuitive moral preference. Although theoretical accounts have proposed a link between moral preferences and interoceptive awareness&mdash;the capacity to sense internal bodily signals, this connection has not been empirically examined. This study examines the relationship between moral preferences and interoception, measured with self-report, heartbeat counting task, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two independent experiments demonstrate that both male and female participants&rsquo; interoceptive awareness and accuracy are associated with their moral preferences aligned with group consensus. In addition, the fractional occupancies of resting-state brain states involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus mediated this relationship. These findings provide empirical evidence of the neural mechanism linking interoception to moral preferences aligned with group consensus.</p>

                <p>The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia&mdash;the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)&mdash;in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semirealistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10&nbsp;ms. Furthermore, cortical &beta;-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.</p>

                <p>Repeated stimulus exposure alters the brain's response to the stimulus. Recording fMRI data from both men and women viewing 120 presentations of two Gabor patches (each Gabor repeating 60 times), we evaluated support for two prominent models of stimulus repetition, the fatigue model and the sharpening model. Our results uncovered a two-stage learning process in the primary visual cortex. In Stage 1, univariate BOLD activation in V1 decreased over the first 14 repetitions of the stimuli, replicating the well known effect of repetition suppression. Applying moving-window multivoxel pattern analysis decoding, we found that (1) the decoding accuracy between the two Gabors decreased from the above-chance level (~60 to ~70%) at the beginning of the stage to the chance level at the end of the stage (~50%). This result, together with the accompanying weight map analysis, suggested that the learning dynamics in Stage 1 were consistent with the predictions of the fatigue model. In Stage 2, univariate BOLD activation for the remaining 46 repetitions of the two stimuli exhibited significant fluctuations but no systematic trend. The moving-window decoding accuracy between the two Gabor patches was at the chance level initially and became progressively higher as stimulus repetition continued, rising above and staying above the chance level starting at the ~36th repetition. Thus, results from the second stage supported the notion that sustained and prolonged stimulus repetition prompts sharpened representations. Additional analyses addressed (1) whether the neural patterns within each learning stage remained stable and (2) whether new neural patterns were evoked in Stage 2 relative to Stage 1.</p>

                <p>Extracellular single-unit responses to tone-in-noise (TIN) stimuli were recorded in the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake female Dutch-belted rabbits. Stimuli consisted of wideband and narrowband TIN with on-and-off characteristic frequency tones. Neural responses to wideband TIN showed a pattern of rates that increased when the tone matched CF and decreased (with respect to noise-alone responses) when the tone was above or below CF. This result differed from narrowband TIN IC responses that depended on envelope fluctuations in the stimulus, consistent with neural-fluctuation sensitivity. The wideband TIN responses could be fit with a difference-of-Gaussians model that had narrow excitation and broad inhibition; responses to TIN could not be predicted by response maps or spectrotemporal receptive fields. Responses to diotic and contralateral presentations of wideband TIN did not differ due to presentation ear. A single-CF computational model of the IC could not predict responses to wideband TIN. However, adding local off-CF inhibitory inputs to an on-CF IC model improved accuracy. These results suggest that broad inhibition could explain encoding of wideband TIN at suprathreshold signal-to-noise ratios, whereas neural fluctuation sensitivity is more important for narrowband sounds.</p>

                <p>To navigate social life, humans make inferences about the intentions, beliefs, emotions, and personalities of other people, i.e., they mentalize. A network of brain regions consistently engages more during mentalizing than during carefully controlled comparison tasks, sometimes cited as evidence of domain-specific mentalizing processes. Here we investigated the possibility that engagement of these regions during mentalizing may be due to uncertainty. We scanned 46 participants (33 female, 13 male) using fMRI as they made mental and non-mental inferences (about human minds, human bodies, and physical objects) under varying levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty explained activation in a key region of the mentalizing network: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Higher uncertainty was associated with greater DMPFC engagement across conditions, and, when controlling for uncertainty, DMPFC engagement did not differentiate mental from non-mental inferences. Results suggest that the apparently selective DMPFC engagement during social inference may be better understood as a response to uncertainty, which is often elevated in social contexts, with implications for the cognitive architecture of the social brain and disorders of social function.</p>

                <p>An age-dependent decline in the amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;)-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently identified risk alleles in the NEP-coding gene further support its role in AD etiology. However, evidence for the impact of NEP on the pathophysiological progression of A&beta; plaque formation, particularly in comparison with another A&beta;-degrading enzyme, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), is still lacking. Furthermore, the functional impact of the NEP mutation, M8V, caused by the AD risk allele in the NEP gene, remains unexplored. Here we found that NEP deficiency in <I>App</I><I><sup>NL-F</sup></I> mice accelerates A&beta; plaque formation more prominently than IDE deficiency in both male and female mice. Additionally, NEP/IDE double knock-out further exacerbated the plaque deposition of <I>App</I><I><sup>NL-F</sup></I> mice, demonstrating a synergistic effect between the two enzymes. We also revealed that the M8V mutation in NEP reduced extracellular A&beta; degradation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, not by impairing catalytic activity but by increasing phosphorylation at an intracellular serine residue. This alteration in phosphorylation decreases NEP localization on the cell surface and extracellular vesicles, thereby limiting extracellular A&beta; degradation. These observations point to the role of aging-associated neprilysin decline in sporadic AD pathogenesis and endorse the strategy of upregulating neprilysin activity to treat preclinical AD.</p>

                <p>Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) is a promising neuromodulation technique capable of noninvasively modulating focal neuronal activities and neural circuits in both animals and humans. The cell-type selectivity of tFUS within targeted areas such as the somatosensory cortex (S1) during sonication has been shown to be parameter related. However, it remains unclear how tFUS affects neural circuits by changing the correlation between neurons and how to optimize the tFUS parameters to modulate neural pathways. In this study, multisite intracranial recordings are used in anesthetized male rats to quantify the neuronal responses to tFUS stimulation recorded from S1 and posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) of cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathway. Different tFUS parameters including ranges of pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) and duty cycles (DCs) are tested. We find that when targeting at S1, only regular-spiking units (RSUs) respond to specific tFUS parameters during sonication (DC, 6&ndash;60%; PRF, 1,500, 3,000 and 4,500&nbsp;Hz), and RSUs from the POm exhibit a synchronized response. The changes of directional correlation between S1 RSUs and POm RSUs indicate the activation of feedback modulation. Delayed responses and correlation changes were further observed at ~200&nbsp;ms postsonication from the neurons in S1 and POm, indicating feedforward modulation. Our results reveal that tFUS can modulate the feedback and feedforward CTC pathways by selectively activating cortical RSUs and adjusting the tFUS parameters, particularly the PRF, to maximize cortical RSU activity could enhance the modulation of the CTC pathway.</p>

                <p>Neural states shape perception at earliest cortical processing levels. Previous work in humans showed a relationship between initial cortical excitation, as indicated by the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), prestimulus alpha oscillations, and the perceived intensity in a somatosensory discrimination paradigm. Here we address the follow-up question whether these excitability dynamics reflect changes in feedforward or feedback signals. To distinguish feedforward neural signals from feedback signals, we leveraged high-frequency oscillations (HFO) which have previously been shown to correspond to neuronal population spiking activity of the first excitatory feedforward volley in the somatosensory cortex. We examined these HFO in electroencephalography (EEG) data of 32 male human participants, performing a somatosensory intensity discrimination task. Spatial filtering and time&ndash;frequency analyses allowed to clearly distinguish HFO from the lower-frequency, conventional SEP. Using Bayesian statistics, we found evidence against the involvement of HFO in moment-to-moment variability of perceived stimulus intensity, in contrast to previously observed prestimulus alpha and N20 effects of the conventional SEP. Given that the N20 component presumably reflects backpropagating membrane potentials toward the apical dendrites (distal dendritic sites), we argue that top-down feedback processes (e.g., related to alpha oscillations) may thus rely on activity modulations at those distal dendrites of involved pyramidal cells rather than on synchronous output firing changes at their basal compartments.</p>

                <p>The insula processes errors in the prediction of risky, motivationally relevant outcomes and thereby is thought to respond similarly to better-than-predicted and worse-than-predicted outcomes. However, the nature of the encoded risk prediction error signals remained unclear. Moreover, the insula was proposed to preferentially process events and stimuli in the aversive domain, rather than in a domain-general fashion. Here, we aimed to illuminate these issues. In a Pavlovian task, participants (<I>n</I> = 41; 19 women) rated both cues and outcomes, allowing us to quantify not only objective but also trial-specific subjective risk prediction errors. We found preferential coding of subjective risk prediction errors in the anterior insula and adjacent frontal cortex. This contrasted with preferential coding of objective risk prediction errors in the mid-insula. The anterior insula encoded the subjective risk prediction errors not only at the time of outcomes but also at the time of cues, in line with a temporally fine-grained computation of these prediction errors. Cue-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred predominantly in the aversive domain, while outcome-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred also in the appetitive domain. Domain-specific analyses of risk prediction errors elicited by the preceding outcome at the time of the next cue indicated that the anterior insula updates risk predictions more strongly in the aversive than the appetitive domain. Together, our findings specify the nature of risk prediction errors processed by the anterior insula as subjective, time-resolved, partly domain-general (outcome), and partly domain-preferential (cue), thereby reconciling apparently disparate lines of research.</p>

                <p>by Jiawei Huang, Yuxuan Du, Kevin R. Kelly, Jinchi Lv, Yingying Fan, Jiang F. Zhong, Fengzhu Sun</p>

Accurate estimation of malignant cell fractions in tissues plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and subsequent treatment decisions. However, most currently available methods provide only point estimates, neglecting the quantification of uncertainties, which is essential for both clinical and research applications. This study introduces DeepDeconUQ, a deep neural network model developed to estimate prediction intervals for malignant cell fractions based on bulk RNA-seq data. This approach addresses limitations in current malignant cell fraction estimation methods by integrating uncertainty quantification into predictions of cancer cell fractions. DeepDeconUQ leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in conjunction with conformalized quantile regression to produce reliable prediction intervals. The model trains a quantile regression neural network to establish upper and lower bounds for cancer cell proportions, followed by a calibration step that refines these intervals to ensure both statistical validity (coverage probability) and discrimination (narrow intervals). Benchmark analyses indicate that DeepDeconUQ consistently surpasses existing methods, achieving high coverage accuracy with tight prediction intervals across simulated and real cancer datasets. The robustness of DeepDeconUQ is further demonstrated by its resilience to various gene expression perturbations. The DeepDeconUQ method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/jiaweih14/DeepDeconUQ.

Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of depolarization with local onset and extended propagation implicated in several pathological conditions. Its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, including our recent studies showing with experimental and computational approaches that the hyperactivity of GABAergic neurons’ can initiate migraine-related CSD because of spiking-generated extracellular potassium (K+) build-up. However, less is known about the role played by GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation. Here we studied mechanisms of CSD propagation, focusing on the role of GABAergic neurons, with experiments performed in mouse brain slices and with a new spatially extended neural field computational model. Experimentally, we induced CSD by applying brief puffs of potassium chloride (KCl) in somatosensory cortex slices from wild type and VGAT-ChR2-tdtomato mice, which specifically express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons. We evaluated the role of GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation by modulating their activity with optogenetic illumination and their synaptic connections with pharmacological tools. We have developed the computational model to obtain realistic simulations of both initiation and propagation of CSD. It includes large populations of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the effect of extracellular ion concentrations on their features. We found that the decrease of the synaptic activity of GABAergic neurons can enhance CSD propagation, because of the reduction of the inhibitory synaptic weight, whereas their spiking activity can enhance CSD propagation because of extracellular K+ upload. However, differently than for CSD initiation, the latter effect is normally hidden by the action of GABAergic synaptic transmission. A reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which can be observed in pathological states, can reveal the potentiating effect of the K+ upload induced by GABAergic activation. The neural field model that we implemented can generate accurate simulations of CSD, providing testable hypotheses on mechanisms, and can also be used for modeling other (patho)-physiological activities of neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013084">Isolating single cycles of neural oscillations in population spiking</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ehsan Sabri, Renata Batista-Brito</p>

Neural oscillations are prominent features of brain activity, characterized by frequency-specific power changes in electroencephalograms (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP). These oscillations also appear as rhythmic coherence across brain regions. While the identification of oscillations has primarily relied on EEG and LFP, they are also present in neuronal spiking. However, several questions remain unanswered: How do spiking oscillations relate to field potential oscillations? How are spiking oscillations correlated across brain regions? And how are they connected to other physiological and behavioral measures. In this study, we explore the potential to detect individual cycles of neural rhythms solely through the spiking activity of neurons, leveraging recent advances in the high-density recording of large neuronal populations within local networks. The pooled spiking rate of many neurons within a local population reflects shared variation in the membrane potential of nearby neurons, allowing us to identify cyclic patterns. To achieve this, we utilize a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, pre-trained on synthetic data, to effectively isolate and align individual cycles of neural oscillations in the spiking of a densely recorded population of neurons. We applied this approach to robustly isolate specific neural cycles across various brain regions in mice, covering a broad range of timescales, from gamma rhythms to ultra-slow rhythms lasting up to hundreds of seconds. These ultra-slow rhythms, often underrepresented in the LFP, were also detected in behavioral measures of arousal, such as pupil size and mouse facial motion. Interestingly, these rhythms showed delayed coherence with corresponding rhythms in the population spiking activity. Using these isolated neural cycles, we addressed two key questions: 1) How can we account for biological variation in neural signal transmission timing across trials during the sensory stimulation experiments? By isolating gamma cycles driven by sensory input, we achieved a more accurate trial alignment in the sensory stimulation experiments conducted in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. This alignment accounts for biological variability in sensory signal transmission times from the retina to V1 across trials, enabling a clearer understanding of neural dynamics in response to sensory stimuli. 2) How do spiking correlations across brain regions vary by timescale? We used the distinct spiking cycles in simultaneously recorded brain regions to examine the correlation of spiking across brain regions, separately for different timescales. Our findings revealed that the delays in population spiking between brain regions vary depending on the brain regions involved and the timescale of the oscillations. This work demonstrates the utility of population spiking activity for isolating neural rhythms, providing insights into oscillatory dynamics across brain regions and their relationship to physiological and behavioral measures.

                <p>by Caroline I. Larkin, Matthew D. Dunn, Jason E. Shoemaker, William B. Klimstra, James R. Faeder</p>

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne, positive-sense RNA alphavirus posing a substantial threat to public health. Unlike similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, EEEV replicates efficiently in neurons, producing progeny viral particles as soon as 3–4 hours post-infection. EEEV infection, which can cause severe encephalitis with a human mortality rate surpassing 30%, has no licensed, targeted therapies, leaving patients to rely on supportive care. Although the general characteristics of EEEV infection within the host cell are well-studied, it remains unclear how these interactions lead to rapid production of progeny viral particles, limiting development of antiviral therapies. Here, we present a novel rule-based model that describes attachment, entry, uncoating, replication, assembly, and export of both infectious virions and virus-like particles within mammalian cells. Additionally, it quantitatively characterizes host ribosome activity in EEEV replication via a model parameter defining ribosome density on viral RNA. To calibrate the model, we performed experiments to quantify viral RNA, protein, and infectious particle production during acute infection. We used Bayesian inference to calibrate the model, discovering in the process that an additional constraint was required to ensure consistency with previous experimental observations of a high ratio between the amounts of full-length positive-sense viral genome and negative-sense template strand. Overall, the model recapitulates the experimental data and predicts that EEEV rapidly concentrates host ribosomes densely on viral RNA. Dense packing of host ribosomes was determined to be critical to establishing the characteristic positive to negative RNA strand ratio because of its role in governing the kinetics of transcription. Sensitivity analysis identified viral transcription as the critical step for infectious particle production, making it a potential target for future therapeutic development.

                <p>by Jana Masselink, Markus Lappe</p>

In current computational models on oculomotor learning ‘the’ movement vector is adapted in response to targeting errors. However, for saccadic eye movements, learning exhibits a spatially distributive nature, i.e. it transfers to surrounding positions. This adaptation field resembles the topographic maps of visual and motor activity in the brain and suggests that learning does not act on the population vector but already on the level of the 2D population response. Here we present a population-based gain field model for saccade adaptation in which sensorimotor transformations are implemented as error-sensitive gain field maps that modulate the population response of visual and motor signals and of the internal saccade estimate based on corollary discharge (CD). We fit the model to saccades and visual target localizations across adaptation, showing that adaptation and its spatial transfer can be explained by locally distributive learning that operates on visual, motor and CD gain field maps. We show that 1) the scaled locality of the adaptation field is explained by population coding, 2) its radial shape is explained by error encoding in polar-angle coordinates, and 3) its asymmetry is explained by an asymmetric shape of learning rates along the amplitude dimension. Learning exhibits the highest peak rate, the widest spatial extension and a pronounced asymmetry in the motor domain, while in the visual and the internal saccade domain learning appears more localized. Moreover, our results suggest that the CD-based internal saccade representation has a response field that monitors only part of the ongoing saccade changes during learning. Our framework opens the door to study spatial generalization and interference of learning in multiple contexts.

                <p>by Tongjia Zhang, Shujie Wang, Yue Zhou, Zitao Jiao, Kejia Lu, Xinyi Liu, Hui Li, Wei Jiang, Xiaowei Zhang</p>

Indisulam, a sulfonamide-based compound, is employed as a second-line therapy for NSCLC due to its anti-tumor activity. However, its clinical efficacy is hindered by acquired resistance, the molecular basis of which remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that hypermethylation of RNA-binding protein 39 (RBM39), a specific target of Indisulam, is closely associated with Indisulam resistance. PRMT6 methylates RBM39 at R92. This methylation inhibits Indisulam-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RBM39, increases RBM39 protein levels, promotes alternative splicing and expression of proto-oncogenes, and ultimately leads to malignant proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells and tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Inhibiting PRMT6 with MS023 or mutating the RBM39 methylation site enhances Indisulam sensitivity in NSCLC and significantly improves its anti-tumor efficacy. Our findings identify methylated RBM39 as a key biomarker of Indisulam resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.

                Background Depression, anxiety, and insomnia significantly impact global health and impose substantial health burdens worldwide. Conventional treatments including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy face limitations in efficacy, side effects, and accessibility. Despite preliminary evidence suggesting the potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in managing these conditions, large-scale evaluations are lacking. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of CHM for the treatment of adults experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Methods This study will be a multicenter, assessor-blinded, pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial. Districts will be randomized to receive the CHM intervention sequentially in four steps based on a computer-generated number, while control districts remain unexposed until their respective intervention phase. The intervention consists of a three-level stepped-care approach: Level 1 involves herbal tisane for mild symptoms, Level 2 offers standardized CHM for moderate symptoms or non-responders to Level 1, and Level 3 combines personalized CHM with psychotherapy for those not improved by Level 2. Symptom severity will be assessed using validated scales, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, and Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia, with primary outcomes measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The study was approved by the Hong Kong Baptist University Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.: REC/22-23/0709). Discussion This study will provide significant insights into the effectiveness of a stepped-care CHM intervention for alleviating depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The results could guide future decision-making regarding the integration of CHM into mainstream healthcare systems in Hong Kong and beyond.
