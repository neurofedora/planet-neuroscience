<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previous studies have shown that lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester (LKE), a semi-synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid lanthionine, can induce proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) inÂ vivo. In the current study, we examined the effects of LKE on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in primary mouse OPCs, as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate those processes. Treatment with LKE stimulated proliferation of OPCs and increased the number of Olig2+, CC1+, and PLP+ cells. LKE also reduced cell death (caspase-3 expressing cells). Measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux showed that LKE increased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx following stimulation with glutamate or ATP, and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux because of depolarization with KCl. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also observed following treatment with a peptide that disrupts interactions of collapsin response mediated protein 2 (CRMP2), a primary target of LKE. These findings demonstrate regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in OPCs by LKE and suggest that these actions may be mediated, in part, by CRMP2. LKE or related analogs could therefore be of benefit for the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other demyelinating conditions.</p>

">Recognizability affects the processing of facial sex information</a></h4>

              
                The different aspects of a face, like sex or identity, can be decoded from the cortical patterns related to its processing. Many studies have investigated this phenomenon with similar outcomes. These studies usually utilize a low number of facial identities and high repetition numbers, which affects the recognizability and familiarity of a face, thus altering the processing. We propose that this commonly employed paradigm influences cortical patterns associated with features seemingly unrelated to identity, such as the sex of a face. In the first experiment, we recreated the findings of previous studies using a few identities and a high presentation number for decoding facial sex. In the second experiment, the identity-presentation ratio was switched. This change resulted in a narrower time window where facial sex related cortical patterns were detected. Decoding accuracy was also diminished, yielding lower values and suggesting a reduced signal-to-noise ratio in the cortex. After expanding the sample size with balanced gender representation, we identified shared cortical patterns related to face-sex processing both within the population and across gender-based subpopulations. These results provide further evidence that familiarity impacts face processing and suggest that previous findings on sex information decoding were likely influenced by the experimental paradigms employed.

">Concurrent maternal stress and THC exposure during pregnancy alters adolescent behavioral outcomes and corticolimbic molecular programs</a></h4>

              
                Cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing, often to alleviate stress and anxiety, yet the long-term effect of prenatal cannabis exposure alone or in combination with psychosocial stress on offspring neurodevelopment or maternal behaviors remains unclear. Here, we developed a translational rodent model combining prenatal {Delta}-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure with chronic psychosocial stress using the maternal witness defeat stress (MWDS) paradigm. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MWDS from gestational day (GD) 3-12 and received daily subcutaneous THC (2 mg/kg) or vehicle until birth. All exposure groups showed impaired maternal behavior, with negative postnatal outcomes and caregiving, with additive effects observed in the combined exposure group. In adolescence, male and female offspring exhibited exposure-specific behavioral alterations. Prenatal stress and combined exposures led to increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced motivated behavior in both sexes, while THC alone primarily impacted female self-care and social behavior. Transcriptomic profiling of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adolescent offspring revealed sex- and region-specific gene expression changes across all exposure groups. Prenatal THC-, stress-, and combined exposures each altered distinct molecular pathways related to mitochondrial function, synaptic organization, and glial signaling. Comparative analysis with a perinatal fentanyl model revealed shared transcriptional substrates involved in synaptic signaling and circadian regulation. These findings indicate that THC and stress independently and additively impair maternal behaviors with lasting neurodevelopment signatures in offspring.

">Nightly dynamics of emotional content in dreams</a></h4>

              
                Emotional processing is a crucial adaptive function. Research suggests that sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, may have a role in processing the emotional load of past events. Notably, dream experiences may offer insight into this nighttime process. Some studies have reported increased emotionality in dreams as the night progresses, possibly reflecting ongoing emotional processing in the sleeping brain. However, findings on how dream affect evolves throughout the night remain mixed. In this study, we investigated how emotional intensity in conscious experiences during sleep changes across the night and sleep stages. Participants (Nsubjects = 20) were subjected to a multiple awakening paradigm, where they were awakened 4-5 times throughout the night and asked to recall their dreams (Ndreams = 61). Additionally, they rated the emotional intensity of their experiences using a structured cued questionnaire. Emotional intensity in dreams increased significantly throughout the night, with late-night dreams being more emotional than dreams collected during earlier sleep. Contrary to our expectation, this increase was not driven by dream reports obtained from REM sleep awakenings. Moreover, late-night dream reports were also significantly longer than those from early sleep, yet the length of the dream reports did not correlate with their emotional intensity. This suggests that the emotionality of dreams is not directly linked to the ability to recall the dream or its narrative complexity. Instead, it could be driven by emotional processes occurring independently throughout the night, or by other factors that regulate our access to dream experiences and their emotional content.

">Bilateral equalization of synaptic output in olfactory glomeruli of Xenopus tadpoles</a></h4>

              
                Odorants stimulate olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to create a bilateral sensory map defined by a set of glomeruli present in the left and right olfactory bulbs. Using Xenopus tropicalis tadpoles we challenged the notion that glomerular activation is exclusively determined ipsilaterally. Glomerular responses evoked by unilateral stimulation were potentiated following transection of the contralateral olfactory nerve. The gain of function was observed as early as 2 hours after injury and faded away with a time constant of 4 days. Potentiation was mediated by the presence of larger and faster calcium transients driving glutamate release from OSN axon terminals. The cause was the reduction of the tonic presynaptic inhibition exerted by dopamine D2 receptors. Inflammatory mediators generated by injury were not involved. These findings reveal the presence of a bilateral modulation of glomerular output driven by dopamine that compensates for imbalances in the number of operative OSNs present in the two olfactory epithelia. Considering that the constant turnover of OSNs is an evolutionary conserved feature of the olfactory system and determines the innervation of glomeruli, the compensatory mechanism here described may represent a general property of the vertebrate olfactory system to establish an odor map.

">Single neurons act as a memory buffer for space</a></h4>

              
                The ability of the brain to briefly retain information, in processes ranging from sensory perception to complex cognition, is believed to be supported by persistent neural firing. Historically, such firing has been attributed to recurrent synaptic networks, in which neural activity reverberates. Here, we present in vivo evidence challenging this view, demonstrating that individual neurons can sustain persistent firing in behaving mice. Disruption of this capability in hippocampal neurons via silencing of TRPC4 channels significantly and selectively reduces persistent firing in vivo, impairs the maintenance of spatial representations, and compromises spatial working memory performance. These findings redefine neurons as active contributors to information retention beyond their conventional role as passive input-output units, potentially reshaping our general understanding of brain computation.

">The acute sleep-inducing effects of light require histamine neurotransmission in mice</a></h4>

              
                Sleep regulation depends on the complex interplay between homeostatic and circadian processes synchronized by the light/dark cycle. Sleep is also directly regulated by light via projections from the retina to the preoptic area (POA). Although the light-responsive POA neurons project to several wake-promoting neurons, including histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMn), there is no functional evidence for their involvement in light-induced sleep. To bridge this gap, we used histidine decarboxylase (HDC, the histamine-synthetizing enzyme) knockout mice (HDC-/-, n=7) and hM4Di-HDC-cre mice (HDC+/+, n=8) subjected to an ultradian light/dark protocol (LD 1h:1h over 24h), and another group of hM4Di-HDC-cre mice (n=8) exposed to a 1-h light pulse. We found that light pulses during the biological night enhanced slow wave sleep and increased cortical EEG power in the delta range (0.5-3Hz), and that these effects were significantly attenuated both in HDC-/- (83 vs 23 min/6h, p=0.005) under LD 1h:1h condition and in hM4Di-HDC-cre mice after acute chemogenetic silencing of histamine neurons by the DREADD ligand deschloroclozapine (15 vs 6 min/h, p=0.0016) under a 1-h light pulse. In addition, the sleep-inducing effect of light was circadian dependent, with the strongest effect at the beginning and end of the night but no effect at all during the biological day in HDC+/+ mice. The response dynamics to light were slowed down when lacking histamine neurotransmission. Our study provides functional evidence that the acute sleep-inducing effects of light on sleep require histamine neurotransmission in mice.

">Neurochemical Features and Glycan Patterns in the Wapiti Vomeronasal Pathway</a></h4>

              
                The vomeronasal system (VNS) plays a central role in mammalian chemical communication, mediating critical social and reproductive behaviors. In the wapiti (Cervus canadensis), a cervid species with complex social structures and pronounced chemical signaling during the rut, the VNS had not been previously characterized. This study provides the first comprehensive anatomical and neurochemical analysis of the VNS in wapiti using histological, lectin-histochemical, and immunohistochemical techniques. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) exhibited clear rostrocaudal differentiation, with distinct sensory and respiratory epithelia, a complex glandular distribution, and region-specific expression of neural markers. Lectin binding patterns confirmed functional compartmentalization along the epithelium, and immunoreactivity for markers such as OMP, PGP9.5, CR, and G-protein subunits (Gi2, G{gamma}8, and G0) revealed detailed molecular organization. Notably, G0-positive neurons in the epithelium did not project to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), suggesting alternative targets, possibly within transitional zones. The AOB showed all canonical layers, including well-defined glomeruli and expression of markers such as calbindin, CR, GFAP, and LEA lectin. Novel findings include the presence of large white matter tracts and region-specific lectin distribution. Confocal double immunofluorescence and autofluorescence imaging were also employed, allowing high-resolution visualization of neuroepithelial architecture and glomerular domains. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the vomeronasal system in wapiti is highly developed and functionally specialized. These findings contribute to a better understanding of chemosensory communication in wild ungulates and provide a comparative framework for future studies in cervid behavior, reproduction, and conservation.

">The basolateral amygdala complex and perirhinal cortex represent focal and peripheral states of information processing in rats</a></h4>

              
                This study used variations of a sensory preconditioning protocol in male and female rats to test a theory that the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) and perirhinal cortex (PRh) represent focal and peripheral states of attention, respectively. It specifically tested predictions derived from the theory regarding when learning about a stimulus that signals danger will be disrupted by BLA or PRh infusions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, DAP5. Consistent with the theory, the effects of these infusions depended on the novelty/familiarity of the conditioned stimulus as well as the manner in which it was paired with foot shock. When a stimulus was novel, its conditioning required activation of NMDAR in the BLA and not the PRh (Experiments 2A and 2B) regardless of whether the stimulus-shock pairings were contiguous or separated in time. When a pre-exposed and, thereby, familiar stimulus was presented contiguously with shock, its conditioning again required activation of NMDAR in the BLA and not the PRh (Experiments 1A, 1B, 3A and 3B). However, when a pre-exposed stimulus was indirectly paired with shock - because it was associatively activated at the time of shock or separated from the shock by another stimulus - its conditioning required activation of NMDAR in the PRh and not the BLA (Experiments 1A, 1B, 3A and 3B). These findings are discussed in relation to theories of information processing that distinguish between focal and peripheral states of attention/memory, and past studies that have examined the substrates of learning and memory in the PRh and BLA.

">Lcn2 deficiency leads to social impairments independent of maternal immune activation.</a></h4>

              
                Maternal infection during pregnancy is a well-established risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), an innate immune protein that is highly upregulated during infection, also affects neuronal and glial function. This study investigates the role of Lcn2 in shaping brain development, particularly after maternal immune activation (MIA). To mimic maternal infection, pregnant mice received intraperitoneal injections of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline on embryonic days 16 to 18 to model infection during the second trimester of pregnancy in humans. We first showed that Lcn2 mRNA is expressed in the fetal brain and that MIA significantly upregulates Lcn2 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus and neocortex of both sexes. To assess functional relevance, we employed Lcn2 heterozygous females to generate wild-type and Lcn2 KO offspring from the MIA and control groups. Both female and male offspring underwent a battery of behavioral assays. Lcn2 deletion and MIA independently induced deficits in social behavior and increased repetitive behavior phenotypes relevant to NDDs in adult animals. However, their combination did not exacerbate these effects, suggesting an occlusion effect. Interestingly, no deficits were observed in the learning and memory task. To investigate potential shared molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing of the fetal forebrain 4 hours after the final LPS injection. This analysis revealed an overlapping group of differentially expressed genes in the Lcn2 KO and MIA groups, indicating convergence on similar transcriptional pathways that may underlie the observed behavioral phenotypes. These results suggest that while Lcn2 may not mediate the pathological effects of prenatal immune challenge, it plays a critical role in normal brain development.

">Blockade of VCAM1 or VLA4 preserves cerebrovasculature and prevents cognitive decline late after stroke</a></h4>

              
                Infarct-induced neurodegeneration increases dementia risk for at least a decade in humans. It can be modeled in wildtype mice, where a cortical stroke results in chronic lymphocytic infiltration into the infarct and delayed cognitive decline. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) on endothelial cells is increased by stroke and facilitates immune cell diapedesis by binding very late antigen 4 (VLA4) on immune cells. We report here that after stroke, chronic but not acute treatment with a VCAM1 blocking antibody reduces B and T lymphocyte infiltration and prevents chronic cognitive dysfunction in wildtype male and female mice. Preservation of cognitive function also occurred after chronic anti-VLA4 treatment despite anti-VLA4s lack of effect on lymphocyte infiltration. High-depth single-cell RNA sequencing of the chronic infarct and peri-infarct cortex revealed an infarct-induced decrease in expression of blood vessel growth and maturation genes in endothelial cells that was reversed by both anti-VLA4 and anti-VCAM1. Plasma proteomics also support a vasculoprotective mechanism of anti-VCAM1. Finally, immunostaining demonstrated that both antibodies improve pericyte coverage of the vasculature and prevent extravascular fibrinogen leakage. Together, our findings indicate that vascular structure and function remain abnormal long after stroke and that the VLA4/VCAM1 axis is a promising treatment target for infarct-induced neurodegeneration as blockade of either molecule restores cerebrovasculature and prevents cognitive decline.

">Validating molecular target-enriched fMRI for disentangling drug effects on dopamine</a></h4>

              
                The psychostimulant methylphenidate may exert its effects on cognition and associated brain signals via action on the dopamine or noradrenaline transporter (DAT/NET). A recently developed and increasingly popular dual-regression approach (REACT; Dipasquale et al. (2019)) attempts to hone in on the molecular mechanisms underlying (drug-induced) changes in fMRI signal by enriching the analysis with information about the spatial distribution of molecular targets of interest. This method has great potential, but hitherto lacked validation of its molecular specificity and functional relevance. Here we leverage a unique pharmaco-fMRI dataset with established dopamine-dependent methylphenidate effects on neural reward prediction error (RPE) signaling, the canonical functional signature of dopamine. Using REACT we found that methylphenidate significantly modulated both DAT and NET-related functional connectivity networks, but only the effect on the DAT network varied with interindividual differences in striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, as measured with [18F]FDOPA PET. Furthermore, methylphenidate affected DAT-related connectivity in the prefrontal cortex in the same location where it affected neural RPE signaling. Together, these findings firmly establish the validity of REACT as a tool for isolating the role of dopamine from that of noradrenaline in methylphenidate's effects on brain function.

">Dynamic recruitment of PV interneurons in the somatosensory cortex induced by experience dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive circuit plasticity plays crucial roles in the brain during development, learning, sensory experience, and after injury. During chronic whisker trimming, a well-studied paradigm for inducing experience dependent plasticity, whisker representations in the somatosensory barrel cortex (S1BF) undergo remapping, with expansion of maps for spared whiskers and contraction of maps for trimmed whiskers. At the cellular level, excitatory pyramidal cells in Layer 2/3 shift their whisker tuning, increasing selectivity to spared whiskers and away from deprived whiskers. While these changes are well documented, the circuit mechanisms regulating experience-dependent plasticity remain incompletely characterized. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play important roles in regulating the spatial and temporal dynamics of sensory evoked activity in Pyr cells and have been implicated in the regulation of experience dependent plasticity in other cortical regions. However, there is little evidence as to how the sensory evoked activity of PV cells change in S1BF during whisker trimming or how those changes might affect cortical remapping. To address these questions, we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon (2P) calcium imaging of PV cells in S1BF before, during, and after inducing experience-dependent plasticity by whisker trimming. At baseline, we found that PV cells have spatially distributed responses to whisker deflections, responding best to the principal whisker of a given barrel and less frequently to surround whiskers in a distance-dependent manner. After whisker trimming, there is a substantial recruitment of PV cells responsive to the spared whisker in deprived, but not spared, barrels. Upon whisker regrowth, this recruitment is reversed, but changes in individual PV cell whisker selectivity can persist for weeks. To probe the potential casual effects of increased PV activity during whisker trimming, we used chemogenetics to acutely manipulate the activity of PV cells and found that modulating PV cell activity strongly affects sensory evoked responses in local Pyr and PV cells, as well as Somatostatin (SST) interneurons. In particular, increased PV cell activity strongly suppressed activity in all three cell types. Together, our results reveal dynamic changes in the spatial distribution and tuning of PV cells during experience dependent plasticity and suggest that increased PV cell activity could constrain the extent of potential cortical remapping in the adult S1BF.

">Early life stress modulates behavioral sensitivity to alcohol and promotes escalation of alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                Adverse childhood experiences significantly increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adulthood. We used a model of combined limited bedding/nesting and maternal separation (LBN+MS) in C57BL/6J background mice to investigate how early life stress (ELS) modulates behavioral sensitivity to alcohol, long-term alcohol drinking patterns, and the effects of alcohol on social behaviors. Our findings reveal that ELS increased sensitivity to the stimulatory locomotor effects of alcohol (1.75 g/kg) selectively in females and reduced sensitivity to the sedative effects of alcohol (4.0 g/kg) particularly in males. This pattern of enhanced stimulation and diminished sedation is consistent with phenotypes observed in human subjects at high risk for developing AUD. ELS also significantly enhanced escalation of voluntary alcohol intake and preference over eight weeks of two-bottle choice intermittent access drinking particularly in males. Additionally, social behavior assessments revealed that ELS impaired sociability selectively in females with a history of alcohol drinking, highlighting the detrimental interactive effects of ELS and alcohol exposure on adaptive behaviors. These results underscore the complex interplay between ELS, alcohol responses, and sex differences, suggesting that ELS creates a high-risk phenotype for AUD through altered alcohol behavioral sensitivity. Our study highlights the importance of future studies that seek to identify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these interactions, which may pave the way for targeted interventions in populations affected by childhood adversity and excessive alcohol consumption.

                Functional improvement following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) remains limited, therefore, it is necessary to develop therapeutic interventions such as cell transplantation to replace lost cells and promote connectivity. While transplantation typically focuses on neurons, it is important to include other neural cells, such as immature astrocytes, to provide a permissive environment, promote neuroprotection and regeneration, and ultimately restore connectivity. In this study, we leveraged cellular engineering using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate astrocyte progenitor cells (hAPCs). We tested two hiPSC lines (WTC11 and KOLF2.1J) to characterize the fate of the hAPCs in vitro and following transplantation at the cervical level of the intact spinal cord for up to 3 weeks. Our results demonstrated efficient and consistent differentiation of the hiPSCs into hAPCs, their survival and integration with the adult spinal cord, with no signs of tumors, deleterious outcomes, and unexpected locations. The ability to survive and the absence of adverse effects indicate that hAPC transplantation could be a safe element of therapy in treating spinal cord injuries.

">Respiration as a dynamic modulator of sensory sampling</a></h4>

              
                Respiration dynamically modulates sensory perception by orchestrating transient states of the brain and the body. Using simultaneous recordings of high-density magneto-encephalography (MEG), respiration, and pupillometry, we show that human perceptual sensitivity to near-threshold visual stimuli was enhanced during inspiration, coinciding with respiration-modulated increases in arousal neuromodulation and cortical excitability. Participants adapted their breathing patterns to align with predictable stimulus onset, and this adaptive respiratory control correlated with improved performance. We further reveal that respiration-modulated changes in alpha and beta oscillations reflect distinct shifts in sensory and motor excitability, respectively. Crucially, respiration-resolved multivariate Granger causality analyses demonstrate that the breathing rhythm systematically shapes directed information flow within a widespread interoceptive network. This respiration-brain coupling was flexibly adjusted based on stimulus predictability, highlighting a novel mechanism for active sensing which integrates internal bodily rhythms with external sensory demands to optimize perception.

">YAP/TAZ create a physical niche for the maintenance of adult neural stem cell quiescence</a></h4>

              
                Adult stem cells inhabit specialized niches where local and systemic cues regulate their behavior. In the mouse ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), neural stem cells (NSCs) dynamically transition between quiescence and activation and reside amidst unique deposits of extracellular matrix (ECM) known as fractones. We show that NSCs that enter quiescence in response to BMP4 secrete a complex ECM that, on its own, is capable of inducing NSC quiescence. This specific ECM triggers the nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), to induce further ECM remodeling and adhesion. Together, the BMP-ECM-YAP pathway creates a two-step mechanism where a soluble and transient quiescence-inducing signal leads to the formation of a physical niche to maintain the quiescent state. In the intact niche, YAP and its paralog TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) essentially sustain quiescence by preserving fractones and the characteristic structural organization. Moreover, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for YAP/TAZ in quiescence.

">Why Meaning Survives Noise: The Spatiotemporal Abstraction Theory</a></h4>

              
                The brain excels at extracting meaning from noisy and degraded input, yet the computational principles that underlie this robustness remain unclear. We propose a theory of spatiotemporal abstraction (STA), in which neural networks integrate inputs across space and time to produce multi-scale, concept-level representations that remain stable despite loss of detail. We demonstrate this principle using spectrograms of spoken sentences and their degraded analogs from cochlear implants, showing that as integration kernels widen, distorted input converges toward the original representation. This mechanism may explain how cochlear implant users comprehend speech despite severely scrambled afferent signals. STA provides a unified framework for understanding abstraction as an emergent property of cortical architecture, with implications for memory, neuroprosthesis design, and robust artificial systems.

">Light and temperature sensitive seizures are regulated by spatially distinct cortex glial populations in the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a brain disorder, characterized by recurrent seizures due to abnormal neuronal activity originating from a population of cortical neurons. It is known that seizures are often associated with abnormal glial cell function at the seizure focus. Recent studies have shown that each glial type such as astrocytes display significant degree of heterogeneity in their development, molecular signatures, and function depending on the brain region in which they are located. It is unknown if such heterogeneity differentially influence/cause seizures. Previous studies in Drosophila have shown that aberrant cortex glial function led to light inducible seizures in Ceramide phosphoethanolamine synthase (cpes) and temperature inducible seizures in zyd mutants. Here, we have optimized Gal4/Split-Gal4/Gal80/LexA drivers to specifically express a gene of interest throughout development in cortex glial subpopulations in different parts of the brain including optic lobe (OL), central brain (CB) and ventral nerve cord (VNC). Using these tools, we performed brain region specific cortex glial rescue experiments in cpes and zyd mutants. We found that OL and CB, but not VNC specific cortex glial expression of UAS CPES, were able to significantly suppress light inducible seizures in cpes mutants. In contrast, VNC but not OL or CB specific cortex glial expression of UAS Zyd suppressed temperature sensitive seizures. Further, in a third model, expression and activation of transient receptor potential (dTrpA1) just in the VNC specific cortex glia was sufficient to induce temperature sensitive seizures in wild type flies. Our findings suggest that regionally specialized cortex glial subtypes differentially regulate seizure susceptibility in seizure models.

">Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation boosts evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system has been implicated in perceptual decision-making, but its causal contribution and underlying mechanisms in humans remain unclear. Here, we used transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to modulate LC-NE activity during a random dot motion task, with stimulation delivered at three distinct time points across groups, each targeting different stages of LC-NE engagement during the task. tVNS reliably increased pupil-linked LC-NE activity across all groups. Notably, early stimulation, at a time when LC-NE activity was still at baseline, elicited a more sustained pupil dilation that extended into the decision phase, resulting in comparable pupil responses during decision-making across groups. For behavior, tVNS selectively improved decision accuracy in contexts characterized by initially low performance, without affecting response times. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that this improvement was specifically associated with increased drift rate, consistent with more efficient evidence accumulation with tVNS. These effects were consistent across groups but most pronounced when tVNS was applied at the early time point. Our results provide causal evidence that tVNS enhances decision-making in a state-dependent manner, likely by stabilizing attentional engagement and facilitating evidence accumulation when endogenous control is suboptimal.

">Cardiac-locked auditory stimulation modulates pupil and neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is sensitive to temporal regularities across bodily and environmental signals. Here, we investigated the pupil and neural correlates of regularity encoding established across cardiac and auditory stimuli. Auditory sequences were presented in synchrony with the heartbeat (synchronous), at a fixed pace, or without temporal regularity while recording pupillometry, electroencephalography, and electrocardiography in healthy participants. Sounds evoked typical pupil dilation in all conditions. However, only in the synchronous condition, pupil dilation progressively decreased over the course of the sequence, possibly reflecting adaptation to the repeated cardio-auditory alignment. A concurrent increase in global EEG activity suggested enhanced cortical processing in response to the synchronous sequence. Pupil constriction was driven by participants with higher heart rate, indicating that pupil adaptation mostly occurs in response to fast auditory sequences. Cardio-audio regularity encoding manifests as a pupil adaptation and an amplification of global EEG activity, likely reflecting improved temporal prediction precision.

">Motor Learning Driven by Sensory Prediction Errors is Insensitive to Task Performance Feedback</a></h4>

              
                Accurate motor behavior relies on our ability to refine movements based on errors. While sensory prediction errors (SPEs), mismatches between expected and actual sensory feedback, predominantly drive such adaptation, task performance errors (TPEs), or failures in achieving movement goals, also appear to contribute. However, whether and how TPEs interact with SPEs to shape net learning, remains controversial. This controversy stems from difficulties in experimentally decorrelating these errors, ambiguity related to possible interpretations of task instructions, and inconsistencies between theory and computational models. To try and resolve this issue, we employed variants of an ''error-clamp'' adaptation paradigm across four reaching experiments (N = 144). Addressing the ambiguity of whether or not the TPE is indeed ignored in standard error-clamp designs as assumed in theoretical (but not computational) models, Experiment 1 explicitly manipulated TPE magnitude by shifting the endpoint feedback location while holding SPE constant. We found that learning was uninfluenced by TPE size. Experiment 2 assumed that the TPE is in fact disregarded under clamp instructions. To then study SPE-TPE interactions, we induced TPEs of varying magnitudes by shifting the target location (''target jump'') while always clamping feedback to the original target location. Here, instructions to reach the new target also induced an SPE. Crucially, learning driven by this SPE was again unaffected by TPE magnitude, a result validated by two additional experiments. Our findings consistently demonstrate that SPE-mediated learning remains impervious to variations in task performance feedback, and point to a distinction in learning mechanisms triggered by these two error signals.

">Synaptic plasticity of prefrontal long-range inhibition regulates cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                While glutamatergic synaptic plasticity is believed to be a fundamental mechanism mediating learning, the behavioral significance of plasticity at cortical GABAergic synapses remains less well understood. Furthermore, despite recent discoveries of long-range projections from neocortical GABAergic neurons, details about how they function are also sparse. Here we combine behavioral optogenetics with patch-clamp electrophysiology to link plasticity at long-range GABAergic synapses with higher-order cognitive functions. Specifically, learning extradimensional rule shifts potentiates callosal GABAergic synapses from prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons onto corticothalamic neurons. Disrupting this potentiation by inhibiting callosal PV terminals during rule shifts induces perseveration, whereas reinstating this potentiation with subsequent gamma-frequency callosal PV terminal stimulation restores flexible behavior. This shows how a novel plasticity locus can regulate brain circuits underlying normal cognition and pathological states.

">Whole brain resting-state EEG dynamic: A mixture of linear aperiodic and nonlinear resonant stochastic processes</a></h4>

              
                Parameterizing electroencephalography (EEG) signals in the spectral domain reveals physiologically relevant components of neural stochastic processes, yet the linearity or nonlinearity of these components remains debated and could not solved by the current Spectral Parameter Analysis (SPA). We address this using BiSCA (BiSpectral EEG Component Analysis), a likelihood-based model unifies EEG spectrum and bispectrum analysis to identify inter-frequency harmonic relationships and distinguish signal components. Simulations demonstrate BiSCA's ability to separate nonlinearity from non-Gaussianity (e.g., linear non-Gaussian systems exhibit diffuse bicoherence, while nonlinear Gaussian systems show localized peaks). Analyzing 1,771 intracranial EEG (iEEG) channels and a large scalp EEG dataset, we uncover a clear organizational principle: the brain's aperiodic ({xi}) activity is predominantly linear, whereas its resonant ({rho}) oscillations, including Alpha () rhythms and other peaks, are the primary source of cortical quadratic nonlinearity. This finding challenges the long-held notion of widespread linearity in large-scale brain signals, as our analysis reveals that over two-thirds of EEG and iEEG channels exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics. Spatially, we uncover a striking dissociation between signal power and nonlinearity: while the occipital Alpha () rhythm dominates in power, the parietal Mu () rhythm generates the strongest nonlinear signature. These findings highlight that nonlinearity is present across the brain, arising from resonant activity.

">Modular striatal dynamics and reciprocal inhibition orchestrate skilled action sequencing</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum, are critical for orchestrating skilled behavioral sequences, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using high-resolution kinematic tracking and neural recordings in mice performing a water-reaching task, we found spatially distributed modules of striatal projection neurons whose activity corresponded to the generation of each element in the sequence (aiming, reaching, and drinking). They are activated sequentially and exhibit reciprocal inhibition, ensuring a strict serial order. Optogenetic activation of the direct pathway of the orofacial module promoted licking while suppressing reaching. Reaching could in turn suppress stimulation-evoked licking, revealing bidirectional inhibitory interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the modular organization in the striatum, coupled with reciprocal inhibition, sculpts the temporal progression of actions, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how the basal ganglia coordinate complex behaviors.

">Variations in neuronal selectivity create efficient representational geometries for perception</a></h4>

              
                Our visual capabilities depend on neural response properties in visual areas of our brains. Neurons exhibit a wide variety of selective response properties, but the reasons for this diversity are unknown. Here, we related the distribution of neuronal tuning properties to the information capacity of the population. Our results from theory, simulations, and analysis of recordings from macaque primary visual cortex (V1) reveal that diversity of amplitude and bandwidth drive complementary changes to the representational geometry of a population. Amplitude diversity pushes the centers of the representations further apart, whereas bandwidth heterogeneity decorrelates the center locations. These geometric changes separate out representations for distinct stimuli, creating more efficient encoding. We study how both types of diversity affect the population code for two different perceptual tasks: discrimination and identification. While both types of diversity improve encoding for both tasks, their distinct impacts on geometry make each more beneficial for one of the two tasks. Amplitude diversity impacts coding efficiency more for discrimination than it does for identification, while bandwidth diversity has a stronger impact on identification. These complementary effects indicate the importance of both types of diversity for perception. Finally, because tuning diversity exists across species and brain areas, our results suggest a fundamental neural coding strategy that may be applicable to a wide range of behavior.

">Expanding the spectrum of annexin A11 proteinopathy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neuron disease</a></h4>

              
                Aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is strongly associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), motor neuron disease (MND-TDP), and overlap disorders like FTLD-MND. Three major forms of motor neuron disease are recognized and include primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Annexin A11 (ANXA11) is understood to aggregate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS-TDP) associated with pathogenic variants in ANXA11, as well as in FTLD-TDP type C. Given these observations and recent reports of ANXA11 variants in patients with semantic variant frontotemporal dementia (svFTD) and FTD-MND presentations, we sought to characterize ANXA11 proteinopathy in an autopsy cohort of 379 cases with FTLD-TDP, as well as FTLD-MND and MND-TDP cases subclassified neuropathologically into PLS, ALS, and PMA. All FTLD-TDP type C cases had ANXA11 proteinopathy. However, ANXA11 proteinopathy was present in over 40% of FTLD-MND and in 38 out of 40 FTLD-PLS cases (95%), of which 80% had TDP type B or an unclassifiable TDP-43 proteinopathy and 15% had TDP type C. Genetic analyses excluded pathogenic ANXA11 variants in all ANXA11-positive cases. We thus demonstrated novel forms of ANXA11 proteinopathy strongly associated with FTLD-PLS, but not with TDP type C or pathogenic ANXA11 variants. Given the emerging relationship of ANXA11 in TDP-43 proteinopathies, we propose that TDP-43 and ANXA11 proteinopathy (TAP) comprises the molecular pathology of cases with abundant inclusions that are co-immunoreactive for both proteins and we subclassify three types of TAP based on distinct clinical and neuropathologic features.

">Projection Targeting with Phototagging to Study the Structure and Function of Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Visual information from the retina is sent to diverse targets throughout the brain by different retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Much of our knowledge about the different RGC types and how they are routed to these brain targets is based on mice, largely due to the extensive library of genetically modified mouse lines. To alleviate the need for using genetically modified animal models for studying retinal projections, we developed a high-throughput approach called projection targeting with phototagging that combines retrograde viral labeling, optogenetic identification, functional characterization using multi-electrode arrays, and morphological analysis. This method enables the simultaneous investigation of projections, physiology, and structure-function relationships across dozens to hundreds of cells in a single experiment. We validated this method in rats by targeting RGCs projecting to the superior colliculus, revealing multiple functionally defined cell types that align with prior studies in mice. By integrating established techniques into a scalable workflow, this framework enables comparative investigations of visual circuits across species, expanding beyond genetically tractable models.

">Adolescent morphine exposure does not alter low-dose lipopolysaccharide-induced sickness behavior in adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent opioid use in the United States commands attention: millions of twelve- to nineteen-year-olds are exposed to opioids each year by prescription and misuse. Recent findings show that opioids bind not only to canonical opioid receptors but also interact with receptors on immune cells within both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The potential for early life opioid exposure to induce long-term changes in the neuroimmune system is not fully understood, particularly given the adolescent brains high susceptibility to neuroplastic changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that adolescent opioid use potentiates physiological and behavioral responses to pathogen-induced sickness later in life. To achieve this, we treated adolescent mice (PND 35-42) with bi-daily escalating doses of morphine to model dependence and then administered a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 mg/kg) in adulthood (PND 60-76) to induce an immune response. In contrast to our hypotheses, we found that adolescent morphine exposure had no additive effect on low-dose LPS-induced sickness measures when assessed in adulthood. These data suggest that adolescent opioid exposure may have minimal effects on future immune challenges, although further research is needed to confirm this.

">The specificity of fatigue cerebral substrates in early Multiple Sclerosis - An fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Context. The cerebral substrates of fatigue in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) are not elucidated yet. This study aims at exploring the disease-specific functional brain substrates of fatigue in pwMS with a recent disease history. Methods. Sixteen pwMS (disease history < 5 years) and 17 matched Healthy Controls (HC) performed a N-Back task with three difficulty levels during fMRI acquisitions following high vs. low fatigue induction. Measures of subjective trait and state fatigue were also recorded. Behavioral performance at n-back task and evolution of subjective fatigue states were analyzed by means of Bayesian repeated measures analyses of variance. Functional MRI data were analyzed to determine between-group differences (1) in task-related brain activity, independently of trait fatigue score; (2) in the association between trait fatigue and brain activity. Results. A similar trajectory was observed in the two groups for subjective and task-related measures following fatigue induction. No between-group difference was observed in brain activity unrelated to fatigue score. However, negative associations between trait fatigue score and brain activity were observed in pwMS, while the associations are positive in HC. Specifically, interactions between group and task difficulty were observed in regions belonging to the Striato-Thalamo-Cortical (STC) network and the fronto-parietal cortex. Conclusion. Group-specific patterns of brain activity related to fatigue were identified in pwMS and HC in the STC circuitry, despite similar behavioral performance and subjective fatigue level. This confirms the implication of the STC loops in fatigue pathophysiology, occurring from the early stages of the disease.

">Four neurons pattern brain-wide developmental activity through neuropeptide signaling.</a></h4>

              
                In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the developing brain becomes electrically active before it is ready to process sensory input. During neural circuit maturation, developmental activity is thought to refine synaptic connections by driving neuronal co-activation in rhythmic patterns. Here we describe cellular interactions that shape brainwide developmental activity and their molecular basis. In Drosophila, patterned stimulus independent neural activity (PSINA) engages the entire brain in highly stereotyped, globally coordinated cycles of activity. A molecularly-defined population of ~2,000 neurons (Transient Receptor Potential Gamma, Trp{gamma}+ neurons) act as an activity template for PSINA. We show that this activity template is patterned by four neurons expressing the neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa). Signaling through the SIFa Receptor, SIFa modulates the activity of both SIFa and Trp{gamma}+ neurons to establish the brainwide activity cycles of PSINA. In turn, Trp{gamma}+ neurons sustain SIFa neuron activity through a recurrent interaction. Neuropeptides modulate neuronal activity through synapse-free, or wireless, signaling; a fitting mode of communication for a process tasked with refining on-going synapse formation. By placing neuropeptide signaling at the core of developmental activity, this work highlights the rich neurophysiological potential of the chemical connectome in shaping the developing brain.

                Introduction Young people in developing nations are particularly affected by HIV infection, which primarily spreads through sexual contact, including anal, oral, and vaginal sex. Heterosexual couples engage in female anal sex, a receptive sexual behavior in which the penis is placed in the female partnerâs anus. Anal intercourse has a higher risk of HIV transmission than vaginal intercourse, especially when there is appropriately low condom use, and the majority of couples are unaware of the risk of HIV transmission during anal intercourse. PROSPERO Registration number CRD42024629445 Objectives of the review To determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young Ethiopian people. Methods This systematic review of peer reviews published in English up to January 31, 2025, measures heterosexual anal and oral sex practices and contributing factors among young people in Ethiopia. STATA version 17 software was used to analyze the pooled prevalence and determinants of heterosexual anal and oral sex practices among young people in Ethiopia. Result Female young people were 2.45 times more likely to engage in heterosexual anal sex practice 95%CI, OR 4.05[1.57-3.33]. Young people who were living alone were 2.50 more likely involved in heterosexual anal sex practice with 95% CI, OR 2.50[1.60-3.40]).Those young people who live alone were 1.91 more likely engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice with 95% CI, OR 1.91[1.7-2.12]. Young people whose intimate partners engaged in heterosexual oral sex practice were 5.13 times more likely to engage in heterosexual oral sex practice in Ethiopia. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of heterosexual oral and anal sex practices in Ethiopia is high. Living alone and female sex were associated with heterosexual anal sex practices, while intimate partner engagement in oral heterosexual sex practice was associated with heterosexual oral sex practice among young people in Ethiopia.

                Background Precision medicine is an emerging approach that tailors treatments based on an individualâs genetic profile. The UAE has made significant strides in this field through initiatives like the National Genomics Strategy and the Emirati Genome Program. However, public awareness and engagement remain key challenges. Purpose This study assesses awareness, acceptance, and utilization of precision medicine among UAE residents. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling method, The survey collected demographic data, health status, knowledge, and experiences with precision medicine. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to analyze associations. Results Most participants (94.3%) were under 50 years old, 62.5% were female, and 60.0% held a bachelorâs degree. Awareness of precision medicine was moderate (55.3%), with higher familiarity among females and students. While 40% believed its main benefit was optimizing drug effectiveness, 38.5% viewed it as crucial for preventing adverse drug reactions. Family and friends (29.5%) were the primary sources of information, yet 25.5% had never heard of precision medicine. Awareness of insurance coverage was low, with 59.0% uncertain about their policy. Genetic testing participation was associated with education level (p < 0.05). Acceptance of precision medicine was higher among individuals with chronic illnesses (p = 0.004). Familiarity scores varied significantly by occupation (p < 0.001) and income (p = 0.004), with higher-income individuals showing greater awareness. Males had a broader range of practice scores (p = 0.003), and individuals with chronic conditions were more aware of precision medicine (p = 0.023). Conclusion Despite advancements, public engagement with precision medicine remains limited. Targeted educational initiatives, improved accessibility, and increased awareness of insurance coverage may enhance adoption and utilization.

                <p>by Yuxi Long, Bruce R. Donald</p>

Accurate binding affinity prediction (BAP) is crucial to structure-based drug design. We present PATH+, a novel, generalizable machine learning algorithm for BAP that exploits recent advances in computational topology. Compared to current binding affinity prediction algorithms, PATH+ shows similar or better accuracy and is more generalizable across orthogonal datasets. PATH+ is not only one of the most accurate algorithms for BAP, it is also the first algorithm that is inherently interpretable. Interpretability is a key factor of trust for an algorithm and alongside generalizability, allows PATH+ to be trusted in critical applications, such as inhibitor design. We visualized the features captured by PATH+ for two clinically relevant protein-ligand complexes and find that PATH+ captures binding-relevant structural mutations that are corroborated by biochemical data. Our work also sheds light on the features captured by current computational topology BAP algorithms that contributed to their high performance, which have been poorly understood. PATH+ also offers an improvement of ðª(m+n)3 in computational complexity and is empirically over 10 times faster than the dominant (uninterpretable) computational topology algorithm for BAP. Based on insights from PATH+, we built PATHâ, a scoring function for differentiating between binders and non-binders that has outstanding accuracy against 11 current algorithms for BAP. In summary, we report progress in a novel combination of interpretability, speed, and accuracy that should further empower topological screening of large virtual inhibitor libraries to protein targets, and allow binding affinity predictions to be understood and trusted. The source code for PATH+ and PATHâ are released open-source as part of the osprey protein design software package.

                <p>by Xixuan Feng, Shuqin Zhang, Limin Li</p>

Cell-cell communication (CCC) is a fundamental biological process essential for maintaining the functionality of multicellular organisms. It allows cells to coordinate their activities, sustain tissue homeostasis, and adapt to environmental changes. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying intercellular communication remains challenging. The rapid advancements in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the analysis of CCC within its spatial context. Despite the development of several computational methods for inferring CCCs from ST data, most rely on literature-curated gene or protein interaction lists, which are often inadequate due to the restricted gene coverage. In this work, we propose OrgaCCC, an orthogonal graph autoencoders approach for cell-cell communication inference based on deep generative models. OrgaCCC leverages the information of gene expression profiles, spatial locations and ligand-receptor relationships. It captures both cell/spot and gene features using two orthogonally coupled variational graph autoencoders across cell/spot and gene dimensions and combines them by maximizing the similarity between their reconstructed cell/spot features. Numerical experiments on five ST datasets demonstrate the superiority of OrgaCCC compared with state-of-the-art methods in CCC inference at the cell-type level, cell/spot level, and ligand-receptor level, in terms of inference accuracy and reliability.

                <p>by Samuel Eriksson Lidbrink, Rebecca J. Howard, Nandan Haloi, Erik Lindahl</p>

The function of a protein is enabled by its conformational landscape. For non-rigid proteins, a complete characterization of this landscape requires understanding the proteinâs structure in all functional states, the stability of these states under target conditions, and the transition pathways between them. Several strategies have recently been developed to drive the machine learning algorithm AlphaFold2 (AF) to sample multiple conformations, but it is more challenging to a priori predict what states are stabilized in particular conditions and how the transition occurs. Here, we combine AF sampling with small-angle scattering curves to obtain a weighted conformational ensemble of functional states under target environmental conditions. We apply this to the pentameric ion channel GLIC using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) curves, and identify apparent closed and open states. By comparing experimental SANS data under resting and activating conditions, we can quantify the subpopulation of closed channels that open upon activation, matching both experiments and extensive simulation sampling using Markov state models. The predicted closed and open states closely resemble crystal structures determined under resting and activating conditions respectively, and project to predicted basins in free energy landscapes calculated from the Markov state models. Further, without using any structural information, the AF sampling also correctly captures intermediate conformations and projects onto the transition pathway resolved in the extensive sampling. This combination of machine learning algorithms and low-dimensional experimental data appears to provide an efficient way to predict not only stable conformations but also accurately sample the transition pathways several orders of magnitude faster than simulation-based sampling.

Attention samples visual space sequentially to enhance behaviorally relevant sensory representations. While traditionally conceptualized as a static continuous spotlight, contemporary models of attention highlight its discrete nature. But which neural mechanisms govern the temporally precise allocation of attention? Periodic brain activity as exemplified by neuronal oscillations as well as aperiodic temporal structure in the form of intrinsic neural timescales have been proposed to orchestrate the attentional sampling process in space and time. However, both mechanisms have been largely studied in isolation. To date, it remains unclear whether periodic and aperiodic temporal structure reflect distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we combined computational simulations with a multimodal approach encompassing five experiments, and three different variants of classic spatial attention paradigms, to differentiate aperiodic from oscillatory-based sampling. Converging evidence across behavior as well as scalp and intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that periodic and aperiodic temporal regularities can theoretically and experimentally be distinguished. Our results extend the rhythmic sampling framework of attention by demonstrating that aperiodic neural timescales predict behavior in a spatially-, context-, and demand-dependent manner. Aperiodic timescales increased from sensory to association cortex, decreased during sensory processing or action execution, and were prolonged with increasing behavioral demands. These results reveal that multiple, concurrent temporal regularities govern attentional sampling.

                Introduction and Importance Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital anomalies, occurring in about 1 in 25,000 births, with duodenal duplications making up 2% to 7% of cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood, they pose diagnostic challenges in adults. Case Presentation We present a case of a 14-year-old boy with mild epigastric pain, whose imaging revealed a large inter-duodeno-pancreatic cystic mass displacing nearby structures. Surgical exploration identified a cystic formation in the second part of the duodenum with a small communication to the duodenal lumen. A subtotal resection and cysto-duodenostomy were performed, leading to an uneventful postoperative recovery. Clinical Discussion Duplication cysts, or alimentary tract duplications, are rare congenital lesions, typically found in the distal ileum but infrequently in the duodenum. Diagnosed mainly in early childhood, they may occasionally present in adulthood, manifesting as abdominal mass, obstruction, or discomfort; in some cases, they mimic choledochal cysts, complicating diagnosis. Surgical removal is the standard treatment, focusing on ensuring proper drainage while preserving biliary and pancreatic ducts. Conclusion Duodenal duplication is a rare, challenging diagnosis in adolescents; this case offers guidance for timely identification and treatment. It aims to support healthcare providers in achieving timely diagnosis and effective management in similar cases.

                Abstract Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCAâs efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an emerging risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate CHIP's association with cerebrovascular or glymphatic changes in a community-based population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study examined Chinese community cohort participants. CHIP mutations were identified through whole-exome sequencing. Intracranial arterial stenosis, silent brain infarcts, cerebral small vessel disease markers, and diffusion along the perivascular space index were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between CHIP and neuroimaging outcomes was investigated through univariate and multivariate logistic/linear regression. The multivariate regression model was adjusted for cerebrovascular disease risk factors, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 18.2% (224 out of 1,229) participants were identified as carriers of CHIP mutations. The prevalence of CHIP generally increases with age (<i>p</i>â=â0.009). After adjusting for vascular risk factors using multivariate regression, CHIP mutations were found to be significantly associated with increased odds of large magnetic resonance imaging-defined infarcts (&gt;15âmm; OR 3.20; 95% CI 1.18 to 8.43; <i>p</i>â=â0.018), inversely associated with diffusion along the perivascular space (<i>Î²</i>â=ââ0.02; 95% CI â0.04 to 0; <i>p</i>â=â0.034), and showed a borderline association with intracranial arterial stenosis (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.30; <i>p</i>â=â0.053). Notably, no statistically significant correlations were observed between CHIP and cerebral small vessel disease markers or brain atrophy measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIP was significantly associated with glymphatic dysfunction and large infarcts, and marginally associated with intracranial arterial stenosis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology linking CHIP to cerebral covert changes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

Genetic deletion or antibody-mediated blockade of VISTA synergizes with radiotherapy to enhance T cell responses and myeloid repolarization, improving tumor control across models and supporting VISTA as a promising combination partner for radiotherapy treatment regimen.

                Ho et al. report in vivo biosensors of endogenous receptor tyrosine kinase activity in Drosophila called pYtags. Using pYtags to characterize Torso activity during embryonic terminal patterning, they find that a dynamic domain of Torso activity is tuned by negative feedback to produce a longer-range stable gradient of ERK.

                Through CRISPR screening, Granda Farias et al. find results consistent with cis CD47-SIRPA interactions relying on QPCTL and that RAB21/Rab21 inactivation reduces macrophage model surface SIRPA/Sirpa expression. Through surface proteomics, they show that Rab21 inactivation modulates expression of macrophage receptors, e.g., Fc gamma receptors impacting phagocytosis of cells and particles.

They found that VCPIP1 enhanced innate immune activity by stabilizing IRAK1/2. Ablation of VCPIP1 reduces IRAK1/2 levels and thereby impairs inflammatory responses, resulting in attenuated sepsis.

Podoplanin deletion drives inflammation, disrupts lymph node architecture, and attenuates stromal/immune cell crosstalk. This study shows the significance of the podoplanin/CLEC-2 signaling axis beyond controlling cellular mechanics and actomyosin contractility.

SUV39H1 deposits lysine methylation at the IÎºBÎ± degron, which signals UACA binding and provokes IÎºBÎ± destabilization. The SUV39H1-IÎºBÎ±-UACA-NF-ÎºB axis is a critical regulator of bone homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101506">Neurons throughout the brain embed robust signatures of their anatomical location into spike trains</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain are known to encode diverse information through their spiking activity, primarily reflecting external stimuli and internal states. However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neuronâs anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Computational approximations of anatomy have the potential to support in vivo electrode localization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96966">Structural characterization and dynamics of AdhE ultrastructures from Clostridium thermocellum show a containment strategy for toxic intermediates</a></h4>

              
                <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i>, a cellulolytic thermophilic anaerobe, is considered by many to be a prime candidate for the realization of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) and is known as an industry standard for biofuel production. <i>C. thermocellum</i> is among the best biomass degraders identified to date in nature and produces ethanol as one of its main products. Many studies have helped increase ethanol titers in this microbe; however, ethanol production using <i>C. thermocellum</i> is still not economically viable. Therefore, a better understanding of its ethanol synthesis pathway is required. The main pathway for ethanol production in <i>C. thermocellum</i> involves the bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE). To better understand the function of the <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a 3.28 Ã structure of the AdhE complex. This high-resolution structure, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provides insight into the substrate channeling of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde, indicates the potential role of <i>C. thermocellum</i> AdhE to regulate activity and cofactor pools, and establishes a basis for future engineering studies. The containment strategy found in this enzyme offers a template that could be replicated in other systems where toxic intermediates need to be sequestered to increase the production of valuable biochemicals.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CACNA1C</span> gene, which encodes the L-type calcium channel Î±<sub>1</sub> Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit. While it is expressed throughout the body, the most serious symptoms are cardiac and neurological. Classical TS type 1 (TS1) and TS type 2 (TS2) mutations cause prolonged action potentials (APs) in cardiomyocytes and in induced neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells taken from TS patients, but the effects of TS mutations on neuronal function in vivo are not fully understood. TS is frequently associated with autistic traits, which in turn have been linked to altered sensory processing. Using the TS2-neo mouse model, we analyzed the effects of TS2 mutation on the visual system. We observed a widening of APs of pyramidal cells in ex vivo patch clamp recordings and an increase in the density of parvalbumin-positive cells in the primary visual cortex. Neurons from TS2-neo mice recorded extracellularly in vivo were less likely to respond to visual stimuli of low spatial frequency, but more likely to respond to visual stimuli of mid-to-high spatial frequency, compared to those from wild-type mice. These results point to a basic processing abnormality in the visual cortex of TS2-neo mice.</span>

Two experiments were conducted to examine these mechanisms. The first experiment compared experts and novices in a continuous tracking task, revealing that athletes displayed superior tracking performance, particularly on predictable trajectory segments. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis identified distinct theta band oscillations between the groups. The source localization highlighted the superior parietal lobule (SPL) as a critical region associated with expertsâ enhanced motor prediction capabilities. The second experiment employed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to inhibit SPL activity and explore its causal role in motor expertise. Results indicated that rTMS disrupted specific neural oscillations but did not significantly alter behavioral performance, suggesting compensatory mechanisms in functionally connected regions. Differences in theta and beta oscillations between experts and novicesâ post-stimulation highlight the adaptive neural plasticity underlying motor expertise. These findings contribute to our understanding of sensorimotor integration in expertise, reinforcing the role of feedforward modeling and predictive processing.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fast and accurate sensoryâmotor mapping is characteristic of successful interaction with our environment and decision-making. Learning is crucial for the development of decision-making processes and has been linked to the balance of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (Î³-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurochemicals in the cortex. However, learning is not a unitary phenomenon and occurs across time. How neurochemical concentrations are involved, and the role of interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remains unclear. The efficacy of tDCS to modulate learning has been linked to baseline concentrations of GABA and glutamate, and stimulation may influence neurochemical concentrations. Here, we assessed how neurochemical balance is associated with tDCS modulations to early- and later-phase sensoryâmotor learning using in vivo 7T ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the right motor cortex (M1), right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and left prefrontal cortex. A single-dual task paradigm assessed performance immediately post (early learning) and 20Â min post (later learning) offline cathodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex. tDCS modulations to learning were associated with neurochemical balance in right IPS during early learning, which shifted to right M1 for later learning. These findings elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms at play as sensoryâresponse mappings shift from executive to motoric operations.</span>

                <p>Savings refers to the gain in performance upon relearning. In sensorimotor adaptation, savings is tested by having participants adapt to perturbed feedback and, following a washout block during which the system resets to baseline, presenting the same perturbation again. While savings has been observed with these tasks, we have shown that the contribution from implicit adaptation, a process that uses errors to recalibrate the sensorimotor map, is attenuated upon relearning (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Avraham et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we test the hypothesis that this attenuation is due to interference arising from the different relationship between the movement and the feedback during washout. Removing the perturbation at the start of the washout block typically results in a salient error signal in the opposite direction to that observed during learning. We first replicated the finding that implicit adaptation is attenuated following a washout period that introduces salient opposite errors. When we eliminated feedback during washout, relearning was no longer attenuated, consistent with the interference hypothesis. Next, we created a scenario in which the perceived errors during washout were not salient, falling within the range of motor noise. Nonetheless, attenuation was still prominent. Inspired by this observation, we tested participants with an extended initial experience with veridical feedback and found that this was sufficient to attenuate adaptation during the first learning block. This effect was context specific and did not generalize to other movements. Taken together, the implicit sensorimotor adaptation system is highly sensitive to memory interference from a recent experience with a discrepant action-outcome contingency.</p>

                <p>Animal studies and human tissue experiments have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes damage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). To test the hypothesis that TBI causes disruption of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) in the ECM, we measured levels of sGAG in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and urine, in patients with severe TBI in the acute postinjury period. Samples of CSF, blood, and urine were obtained within 72&nbsp;h of injury in patients who received external ventricular drains as part of their treatment of severe TBI. Levels of chondroitin and heparan sGAGs were measured, along with their disaccharide constituents. Demographic information, presence of polytrauma, brain injury load, and distance of radiologically visible parenchymal injury from the ventricle were analyzed for correlation with total subtype sGAG levels. Levels were measured in 14 patients ranging in age from 17 to 90 years. CSF sGAG levels were variable among patients, with higher sGAG levels in plasma compared with CSF. Patients with polytrauma had nonsignificantly higher blood sGAG compared with patients with isolated head injury. Subcategories of CSF sGAG levels correlated with distance from the ventricle of parenchymal injury but not with brain injury load. This study is the first to measure sGAG levels in ventricular CSF and the first to analyze levels in TBI. These data demonstrate the elevation locally of intracranial sGAGs after severe TBI and suggest rapid local metabolism of these breakdown products. The consequences of ECM breakdown may provide unique therapeutic and preventive avenues to mitigate postinjury sequelae.</p>

                <p>by Bart Borghans, Daniel Kortzak, Piersilvio Longo, Bettina Kolen, Jan-Philipp Machtens, Christoph Fahlke</p>

Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) fill synaptic vesicles with glutamate and remove luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> via an additional anion channel mode. Both of these transport functions are stimulated by luminal acidification, luminal-positive membrane potential, and luminal Cl<sup>-</sup>. We studied VGLUT1 transporter/channel activation using a combination of heterologous expression, cellular electrophysiology, fast solution exchange, and mathematical modeling. Cl<sup>-</sup> channel gating can be described with a kinetic scheme that includes two protonation sites and distinct opening, closing, and Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding rates for each protonation state. Cl<sup>-</sup> binding promotes channel opening by modifying the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values of the protonation sites and rates of pore opening and closure. VGLUT1 transports glutamate and aspartate at distinct stoichiometries: H<sup>+</sup>-glutamate exchange at 1:1 stoichiometry and aspartate uniport. Neurotransmitter transport with variable stoichiometry can be described with an alternating access model that assumes that transporters without substrate translocate in the doubly protonated state to the inward-facing conformation and return with the bound amino acid substrate as either singly or doubly protonated. Glutamate, but not aspartate, promotes the release of one proton from inward-facing VGLUT1, resulting in preferential H<sup>+</sup>-coupled glutamate exchange. Cl<sup>-</sup> stimulates glutamate transport by making the glutamate-binding site accessible to cytoplasmic glutamate and by facilitating transitions to the inward-facing conformation after outward substrate release. We conclude that allosteric modification of transporter protonation by Cl<sup>-</sup> is crucial for both VGLUT1 transport functions.

Background <p>Polygenic risk score (PRS) have proved to offer robust risk prediction for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the global CAD PRS summarizes the joint effects of all the markers in the genome, masking potential genetic heterogeneity that may be important for disease interpretation and targeted interventions.</p> Methods <p>Using summary-level data, we identified 43 significant CAD-related traits based on genetic correlations, and further classified them into eight pleiotropy clusters based on their biological functions. We then partitioned the genome into 2,353 near-independent regions. Variants in each region were assigned to the trait most genetically similar to CAD, and then were labeled with the corresponding pleiotropy cluster. We grouped variants without labels into a ninth, non-specific cluster. The Pleiotropy Decomposed (PD) PRSs for each of the nine clusters were calculated using variants assigned to each cluster for 407,903 samples of European ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKBB).</p> Results <p>We decomposed the CAD PRS into nine PD-PRSs and further stratified individuals with high CAD-PRS into nine subgroups. Each PD-PRS accounted for a higher proportion of the global CAD-PRS within its corresponding subgroup than in the remaining subjects with high CAD-PRS (e.g., 25.2% (0.07) vs. 10.06% (0.07) for lipids-PD-PRS). Additionally, these subgroups showed distinct clinical features. For example, in the lipids-related subgroup, lipoprotein(a) and LDL-cholesterol levels were 67.5% and 18.3% higher, respectively, compared to the remaining high-risk individuals. Furthermore, significant interactions were observed between blood pressure and BP PD-PRS, and between current smoking and respiratory system PD-PRS.</p> Conclusion <p>Our findings suggest that PD-PRSs may reveal substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals with high CAD-PRS. The unique PD-PRS compositions of each individual can highlight the relative importance of different pleiotropic regions.</p>

                <p>by Mihkel Saluri, Michael Landreh, Patrick Bryant</p>

The risk of pandemics is increasing as global population growth and interconnectedness accelerate. Understanding the structural basis of protein-protein interactions between pathogens and hosts is critical for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and guiding treatment or vaccine development. Despite 21,064 experimentally supported human-pathogen interactions in the HPIDB, only 52 have resolved structures in the PDB, representing just 0.2%. Advances in protein complex structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, now enable highly accurate modelling of heterodimeric complexes, though their application to host-pathogen interactions, which have distinct evolutionary dynamics, remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the structural protein-protein interaction network between humans and ten pathogens, predicting structures for 9,452 interactions, only 10 of which have known structures. We identify 30 interactions with an expected TM-score â¥0.9, tripling the structural coverage in these networks. A detailed analysis of the Francisella tularensis dihydroprolyl dehydrogenase (IPD) complex with human immunoglobulin kappa constant (IGKC) using homology modelling and native mass spectrometry confirms a predicted 1:2:1 heterotetramer, suggesting potential roles in immune evasion. These findings highlight the transformative potential of structure prediction for rapidly advancing vaccine and drug development against novel pathogenic targets.

Leprosy, or Hansenâs disease, is a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves, causing neuropathy to varying degrees. It can result in physical disabilities and functional loss and is particularly prevalent amongst the most vulnerable populations in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The persistent stigma and social exclusion associated with leprosy complicate eradication efforts exacerbate the wider challenges faced by NTDs in sourcing the necessary resources and attention for control and elimination. The introduction of Multidrug Therapy (MDT) significantly lowers the global disease burden. Despite this breakthrough in the treatment of leprosy, over 200,000 new leprosy cases are reported annually across more than 120 countries, emphasizing the need for ongoing detection and management efforts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform leprosy care by accelerating early detection, improving accurate diagnosis, and enabling predictive modeling to improve the quality for those affected. The potential of AI to provide information to assist healthcare professionals in interventions that reduce the risk of disability, and consequently stigma, particularly in endemic regions, presents a promising path to reducing the incidence of leprosy and improving integration social status of patients. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines the state of the art in research on the use of AI for leprosy care. From an initial 657 works from six scientific databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Springer), only 30 relevant works were identified, after analysis of three independent reviewers. We have excluded works due duplication, couldnât be retrieved and quality assessment. Results show that current research is focused primarily on the identification of symptoms using image based classification using three main techniques, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and support vector machines; a small number of studies focus on other thematic areas of leprosy care. A comprehensive systematic approach to research on the application of AI to leprosy care can make a meaningful contribution to a leprosy-free world and help deliver on the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. The precise origins of such insights are unknown. Some evidence has shown that sleep facilitates insights, while other work has not found such a relationship. One recent suggestion that could explain this mixed evidence is that different sleep stages have differential effects on insight. In addition, computational work has suggested that neural variability and regularisation play a role in increasing the likelihood of insight. To investigate the link between insight and different sleep stages as well as regularisation, we conducted a preregistered study in which N=90 participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a 20 minute daytime nap. Sleep EEG data showed that N2 sleep, but not N1 sleep, increases the likelihood of insight after a nap, suggesting a specific role of deeper sleep. Exploratory analyses of EEG power spectra showed that spectral slopes could predict insight beyond sleep stages, which is broadly in line with theoretical suggestions of a link between insight and regularisation. In combination, our findings point towards a role of N2 sleep and aperiodic, but not oscillatory, neural activity for insight.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27301?af=R">The Role of Electroencephalography in Predicting PostâStroke Seizures and an Updated Prognostic Model (SeLECTâEEG)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures negatively impact stroke outcomes, highlighting the need for reliable predictors of post-stroke epilepsy. Although acute symptomatic seizures are a known risk factor, most stroke survivors who develop epilepsy do not experience them. Early electroencephalography (EEG) findings may enhance risk prediction, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, aiding in patient management and counseling.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from 1,105 stroke survivors (mean age 71âyears, 54% male) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent EEG within 7âdays post-stroke. Electrographic biomarkers, including epileptiform activity and regional slowing, were analyzed for their association with post-stroke epilepsy using Cox proportional hazards regression and FineâGray subdistribution hazard models, adjusted for differences in EEG timing and patient characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Post-stroke epilepsy developed in 119 patients (11%), whereas 233 (21%) had acute symptomatic seizures. The 5-year epilepsy risk was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30â49%) in patients with epileptiform activity versus 13% (95% CI: 9â16%) in those without. Regional slowing doubled the 5-year epilepsy risk (23%, 95% CI: 17â30% vs 11%, 95% CI: 7â16%). Epileptiform activity (subdistribution hazard ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.5â3.4, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001) and regional slowing (subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1â2.7, <i>p</i>â=â0.02) were independently associated with post-stroke epilepsy. A novel prognostic model, SeLECT-EEG (concordance statistic: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71â0.80), outperformed the previous standard (SeLECT<sub>2.0</sub>; 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65â0.76, <i>p</i>â&lt;â0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Electrographic biomarkers improve post-stroke epilepsy prediction beyond clinical risk factors. The SeLECT-EEG model enhances early risk stratification, particularly in patients without acute symptomatic seizures, informing management strategies and patient counseling.

                <p>Author(s): Gautam Reddy</p><p>Motivated by developmental processes in biology, this study extends a classical optimal transport framework to processes that include growth. One key result presented here is the derivation of an analog of the Benamou-Brenier theorem, which identifies the conditions under which the transport map is described by stochastic dynamics on a potential landscape. The author exploits a mathematical connection between stochastic control theory, optimal transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The framework can be used to find a potential landscape that describes the map from any (non-degenerate) initial distribution over cell states (of arbitrary dimensionality) to any target distribution in a finite time.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/63d2-4wq6.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

                Background In 2022, WHOâs World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA75.8, emphasizing the critical role of clinical trials in generating high-quality evidence and promoting equitable access to health interventions globally. In response, rapid landscape reviews were conducted to assess global clinical trial regulations, capacities, and funding distribution. Methods The analysis synthesized regulatory frameworks from 94 countries, institutional capacity data from the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), and funding data from World RePORT for trials registered between 2018-2022. Gaps in data availability and quality were assessed. Results Most countries reference international ethical guidelines, with universal requirements for ethics approval and informed consent. However, only 66% mandate public trial registration, and 40% require results reporting, with stark disparities between high- and low-income countries. High-income countries host over half of global trials; low-income countries contribute less than 1% despite high disease burden. Clinical trials sponsored by non-commercial entities are particularly scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Funding remains concentrated in the Americas and European regions, primarily driven by major funders such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States of America and European Commission. Significant data accessibility challenges persist due to incomplete registry records, inconsistent standards, lack of harmonized identifiers, and limited bulk data access. Recommendations Urgent actions include reinforcing international standards for trial registries, harmonizing data fields, improving registry interoperability, leveraging unique identifiers, enhancing multilingual accessibility, auditing data quality, pooling analytical resources, promoting open data policies, and investing in registry infrastructure and trained personnel. Conclusion Addressing data gaps and inequities in clinical trial ecosystems requires concerted action by global stakeholders. Improved data transparency and interoperability are essential to guide equitable research investments, foster coordination, and strengthen clinical trial capacity worldwide.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The possible impact of meningeal Î¼-opioid receptor (Î¼OR) binding in migraine remains unknown. This study investigated Î¼OR availability in the cranial parameninges involved in migraine initiation via nociceptor activation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used positron emission tomography with [<sup>11</sup>C] carfentanil, and measured Î¼OR availability in meninges and adjacent skull bone (parameningeal tissue [PMT]) under resting and sustained thermal pain threshold stress challenge conditions. Î¼OR availability was compared between individuals with migraine in interictal and ictal phases and healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between Î¼OR availability and headache intensity, as well as the potential influence of sex on this measure.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 36 patients with interictal episodic migraine (8 also assessed ictally), 7 patients with ictal chronic migraine, and 22 healthy controls were included in the analysis. Both the episodic migraine and chronic migraine groups showed lower Î¼OR availability in the parietal PMT than healthy controls during the ictal resting phase. No significant differences were observed during the interictal phase. Exploratory analyses on the effects of sex indicated that both healthy women and migraine patients of both sexes showed lower Î¼OR availability in the frontal PMT compared with healthy men in the ictal sustained thermal pain threshold stress condition. Furthermore, the interictal Î¼OR availability in the frontal PMT was negatively associated with headache intensity in the preceding month.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed variability in PMT Î¼OR availability across the different cortical regions and migraine episodes, along with its association with pain intensity, underscores the critical role of extracerebral mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                da Silva Antunes et al. examine SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity across 3 years of repeated vaccinations. While antibodies increase with each booster, T cells responses plateau early and remain stable without signs of exhaustion or functional impairment. Asymptomatic infections promote Th17-like and regulatory CD4+ T cell expansion, suggesting balanced immunity.

                Brain tumors alter gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses. Kim et al. show that tryptophan supplementation restores microbiota balance, particularly increasing Duncaniella dubosii, which replicates the beneficial effects of tryptophan on T cell responses and immunotherapy efficacy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96157">Focal adhesion-derived liquid-liquid phase separations regulate mRNA translation</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a major organizing principle in cells. Recent work showed that multiple components of integrin-mediated focal adhesions, including p130Cas can form LLPS, which govern adhesion dynamics and related cell behaviors. In this study, we found that the focal adhesion protein p130Cas drives the formation of structures with the characteristics of LLPS that bud from focal adhesions into the cytoplasm. Condensing concentrated cytoplasm around p130Cas-coated beads allowed their isolation, which were enriched in a subset of focal adhesion proteins, mRNAs, and RNA binding proteins, including those implicated in inhibiting mRNA translation. Plating cells on very high concentrations of fibronectin to induce large focal adhesions inhibited message translation which required p130Cas and correlated with droplet formation. Photo-induction of p130Cas condensates using the Cry2 system also reduced translation. These results identify a novel regulatory mechanism in which high adhesion limits message translation via induction of p130Cas-dependent cytoplasmic LLPS. This mechanism may contribute to the quiescent state of very strongly adhesive myofibroblasts and senescent cells.

                <p>Extracellular recordings in freely moving mice, especially those with movable electrodes (microdrives), are crucial for understanding brain function. However, existing microdrives are often heavy, expensive, fragile, and unsuited for long-term studies with multichannel recordings. The OptoDrive is a new, lightweight (3.2&nbsp;g), low-cost system for chronic neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation in mice. It features a detachable, 16-channel tungsten-wire electrode assembly with a 3&nbsp;mm stroke (15&nbsp;&mu;m step displacement) and an integrated optical fiber. This system enables repeated implantation and explantation without surgery, requiring only gas anesthesia. The OptoDrive has demonstrated stable recordings from the lateral hypothalamus of freely behaving mice for nearly 1&nbsp;month and successful optogenetic silencing of neuronal activity. In conclusion, OptoDrive offers a cost-effective, compact solution for long-term electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving mice.</p>

                <p>Marker-based motion capture (MBMC) is a powerful tool for precise, high-speed, three-dimensional tracking of animal movements, enabling detailed study of behaviors ranging from subtle limb trajectories to broad spatial exploration. Despite its proven utility in larger animals, MBMC has remained underutilized in mice due to the difficulty of robust marker attachment during unrestricted behavior. In response to this challenge, markerless tracking methods, facilitated by machine learning, have become the standard in small animal studies due to their simpler experimental setup. However, trajectories obtained with markerless approaches at best approximate ground-truth kinematics, with accuracy strongly dependent on video resolution, training dataset quality, and computational resources for data processing. Here, we overcome the primary limitation of MBMC in mice by implanting minimally invasive markers that remain securely attached over weeks of recordings. This technique produces high-resolution, artifact-free trajectories, eliminating the need for extensive post-processing. We demonstrate the advantages of MBMC by resolving subtle drug-induced kinematic changes that become apparent only within specific behavioral contexts, necessitating precise three-dimensional tracking beyond simple flat-surface locomotion. Furthermore, MBMC uniquely captures the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of harmaline-induced tremors, revealing previously inaccessible correlations between body parts and thus significantly improving the translational value of preclinical tremor models. While markerless tracking remains optimal for many behavioral neuroscience studies in which general posture estimation suffices, MBMC removes barriers to investigations demanding greater precision, reliability, and low-noise trajectories. This capability significantly broadens the scope for inquiry into the neuroscience of movement and related fields.</p>

                <p>When a cue is located away from its associated reward, some animals will learn to approach the site of reward (goal-tracking behavior) while others will approach the cue (sign-tracking behavior). The acquisition of sign tracking, but not goal tracking, is dependent on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and we have previously demonstrated that reward-evoked activity in the NAc core may reflect different patterns of dopamine release in sign tracker versus goal tracker individuals. However, a causal relationship among dopamine release, NAc activity, and sign tracking has not been established. Using male and female TH::Cre rats, we expressed inhibitory or excitatory opsins in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and examined the impact of optical manipulation of dopamine neurons on behavior and concurrent NAc neuronal activity. We found that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons at the time of reward suppressed the acquisition of sign-tracking, but not goal-tracking, behavior. On the other hand, stimulation of dopamine neurons did not alter the acquisition of sign tracking; however, cessation of stimulation impeded further acquisition of sign tracking. Finally, both inhibition and stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons rapidly modulated activity in a subset of NAc neurons and led to changes in cue- and reward-related activity across sessions. Overall, these findings support the ideas that sign tracking and goal tracking are the products of two different learning processes&mdash;one dopamine-dependent and one not&mdash;and that the impact of VTA dopamine on sign tracking may be mediated by activity in the NAc core.</p>

                <p><I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a crucial role in excitatory neurotransmission, with numerous pathogenic variants identified in the GluN subunits, including their ligand-binding domains (LBDs). The prevailing hypothesis postulates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control machinery verifies the agonist occupancy of NMDARs, but this was tested in a limited number of studies. Using microscopy and electrophysiology in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we found that surface expression of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing a set of alanine substitutions within the LBDs correlated with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine (GluN1 subunit mutations) while not correlating with the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate (GluN2A subunit mutations). The mutant cycle of GluN1-S688 residue, including the pathogenic GluN1-S688Y and GluN1-S688P variants, showed a correlation between relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for glycine, as well as with the calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for glycine obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, the mutant cycle of GluN2A-S511 residue did not show any correlation between the relative surface expression of the GluN1/GluN2A receptors and the measured EC<SUB>50</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate or calculated <I>G</I><SUB>binding</SUB> values for <scp>l</scp>-glutamate. Coexpression of both mutated GluN1 and GluN2A subunits led to additive or synergistic alterations in the surface number of GluN1/GluN2A receptors. The synchronized ER release by ARIAD technology confirmed the altered early trafficking of GluN1/GluN2A receptors containing the mutated LBDs. The microscopical analysis from embryonal rat hippocampal neurons (both sexes) corroborated our conclusions from the HEK293 cells.</p>

                <p>A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition. However, the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior are still poorly understood. We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B125">Voorhies et al., 2021</cross-ref>). These findings beg the question: What is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition? Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and the lateral parietal cortex in participants drawn from the same sample as our previous study. We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, 1,806 total) and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7&ndash;18 years (20 females). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci. Broadly, we found that (1) connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated and more accurately than cortical patches equated for size and shape; (2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; (3) sulci clustered based on connectivity patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and (4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation. These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be functionally relevant and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.</p>

                <p>Navigating within our neighborhood or learning a set of concepts requires remembering the relationship between individual items that are presented sequentially. Theta activity in the mammalian hippocampus is related to the encoding and recall of relational structures. However, how theta oscillations are involved in retrieving temporal order information in opposing directionality (forward vs backward) has not been characterized. Here, using intracranial recordings from 10 human epileptic patients of both genders with hippocampal electrodes, we tested the patients with a temporal order memory task in which they learned the spatial relationship among individual items arranged along a circular track and were tested on both forward-cued and backward-cued retrieval conditions. We found that sustained high-power oscillatory events in the hippocampal theta (2&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band, as quantified by <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate, were higher for the backward conditions during the later stage but not in the earlier stage. The theta <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate results are consistent with the behavioral memory performance and the theta phase to gamma power cross-frequency coupling. Control analyses on change in theta or gamma power and their peak frequencies, aperiodic activity, hemispheric differences, and <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> duration confirm that elevated theta rhythmic activity carry specific physiological information with respect to experience-dependent (episodic) learning. In contrast, we observed a stronger effect of forward than backward retrieval for the low gamma (30&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) <I>P</I><SUB>episode</SUB> rate irrespective of stages. Our results revealed how theta oscillations are specifically implicated in the learning process for efficient retrieval of temporal order memories under opposing directionality.</p>

                <p>The neural processes that change when falling asleep are only partially understood. At the cortical level, features of both spontaneous neural activity and sensory responses change between wakefulness and sleep. For example, in the early auditory cortex, sleep increases the occurrence of postonset silent (OFF) periods and elevates population synchrony. However, it remains unknown whether such changes occur abruptly or gradually around sleep onset and awakening. Here, we recorded spontaneous and sound-evoked neuronal spiking activity in the early auditory cortex along with polysomnography during thousands of episodes when male rats fell asleep or woke up. We found that when falling asleep, stimulus-induced neuronal silent periods (OFF periods), characteristic of nonrapid eye movement sleep, increased within a few seconds around sleep onset. In contrast, a gradual increase in neuronal population synchrony built up over tens of seconds until reaching maximal levels. EEG auditory-evoked potentials likely representing stimulus-triggered "K-complexes" changed along with postonset neuronal firing, whereas ongoing EEG slow-wave activity was associated with neuronal population synchrony. Similar effects, but with opposite direction, were observed around awakenings. The results highlight late stimulus-induced neuronal silence as a key feature changing abruptly around transitions between vigilance states, likely reflecting neuronal bistability and manifesting also in EEG-evoked potentials. More generally, these findings emphasize the added value of going beyond monitoring ongoing activity and perturbing the nervous system to reveal its state&mdash;an insight that could also help guide the development of more sensitive noninvasive monitors of falling asleep in humans.</p>

                <p>We report here that microglia exert a surprisingly discrete but functionally critical influence on synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus. Treatment of adult male mice with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor antagonist PLX5622 (PLX), with resultant depletion of forebrain microglia, did not disturb basal synaptic transmission at four synaptic connections in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was also intact for three of these sites, but the singular, endocannabinoid-dependent form of LTP expressed by lateral perforant path (LPP) input to the dentate gyrus (DG) was severely impaired. The LPP&ndash;LTP defect occurred in conjunction with a pronounced increase in DG (but not neocortical) levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the retrograde (spine-to-terminal) endocannabinoid messenger that initiates LPP&ndash;LTP. Despite this, concentrations of the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase were not affected by PLX treatment. Synaptic levels of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, which mediates 2-AG effects on LPP&ndash;LTP, were similarly unaffected. Prior work has implicated the LPP in episodic memory. We determined that the LPP&ndash;LTP impairment in PLX-treated mice was accompanied by a failure to acquire the three basic elements of an episode: the identities, locations, and presentation order for a collection of olfactory cues. Treatment with JZL184, which inhibits the 2-AG degradative enzyme monoglyceride lipase, restored both LPP&ndash;LTP and episodic "What" encoding in PLX-treated mice. We conclude that microglia selectively regulate endocannabinoid transmission at the LPP-&gt;DG synapse and thereby potently influence synaptic plasticity at the initial stage of a corticohippocampal circuit that is critical for episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Speech is a multisensory signal that can be extracted from the voice and the lips. Previous studies suggested that occipital and temporal regions encode both auditory and visual speech features but their location and nature remain unclear. We characterized brain activity using fMRI (13 males and 11 females) to functionally and individually define bilateral fusiform face areas (FFA), the left word-selective ventral occipito-temporal cortex (word-VOTC), an audiovisual speech region in the left superior temporal sulcus (lSTS); and control regions in bilateral scene-selective parahippocampal place areas (PPA). In these regions, we performed multivariate pattern classification of corresponding phonemes (speech sounds) and visemes (lip movements). We observed that the word-VOTC and lSTS represent phonological information from both vision and sounds. The multisensory nature of phonological representations appeared selective to the word-VOTC, as we found viseme but not phoneme representation in adjacent FFA, while PPA did not encode phonology in any modality. Interestingly, cross-modal decoding revealed aligned phonological representations across the senses in lSTS, but not in word-VOTC. A whole-brain cross-modal searchlight analysis additionally revealed aligned audiovisual phonological representations in bilateral pSTS and left somato-motor cortex overlapping with oro-facial articulators. Altogether, our results demonstrate that auditory and visual phonology are represented in the word-VOTC, extending its functional coding beyond orthography. The geometries of auditory and visual representations do not align in the word-VOTC as they do in the STS and left somato-motor cortex, suggesting distinct representations across a distributed multisensory phonological network.</p>

                <p>Changes in the activity profile of cortical neurons are due to effects at the scale of local and long-range networks. Accordingly, abrupt transitions in the state of cortical neurons&mdash;a phenomenon known as Up&ndash;Down states (UDS)&mdash;have been attributed to variation in the activity of afferent neurons. However, cellular physiology and morphology may also play a role in causing UDS. This study examines the impact of dendritic nonlinearities, particularly those mediated by voltage-dependent NMDA receptors, on the response of cortical neurons to balanced excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Using a neuron model with two segregated dendritic compartments, we compared cells with and without dendritic nonlinearities. NMDA receptors boosted somatic firing in the balanced condition and increased the correlation between membrane potentials across the compartments of the neuron model. Dendritic nonlinearities elicited strong bimodality in the distribution of the somatic potential when the cell was driven with cortical-like input. Moreover, dendritic nonlinearities could detect small input fluctuations and lead to UDS whose statistics and dynamics closely resemble electrophysiological data. UDS also occurred in recurrent networks with oscillatory firing activity, as in anaesthetized animal models, when dendritic NMDA receptors were partially disabled. These findings suggest that there is a dissociation between cellular and network-level features that could both contribute to the emergence of UDS. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dendritic integration and activity-driven dynamics in the origin of cortical bistability.</p>

                <p>Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the tightly regulated process of neurogenesis from radial glial cells (RGCs) to intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) to neurons during embryonic brain development. Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins as important epigenetic readers are implicated in development and diseases, yet their roles in embryonic neurogenesis remain largely unexplored. In this study, we found different PHD finger proteins are differentially expressed along the neurogenesis trajectory. Among them, we investigated the function of PHF23 using mouse models, which is highly expressed in RGCs and IPCs, but not in neurons. Our findings demonstrate that PHF23 is essential for proper neurogenesis, and <I>Phf23</I> knock-out (<I>Phf2</I>3-KO) results in cortical developmental defects due to differentiation blockade of RGCs. Mechanistically, PHF23 bind with HDAC2, inhibiting its deacetylation activity on the active histone mark H3K27ac, thereby promoting the expression of neuronal differentiation pathway genes such as <I>Tcf4</I> and <I>Eya1</I>. Overexpression of <I>Tcf4</I> rescues the differentiation defects of <I>Phf2</I>3-KO NSCs. These results establish PHF23 as a pivotal regulator of neurogenesis, indicating cell type-specific functions of PHD finger proteins.</p>
