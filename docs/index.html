              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05806">I Think, Therefore I Hallucinate: Minds, Machines, and the Art of Being Wrong</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical work examines 'hallucinations' in both human cognition and large language models, comparing how each system can produce perceptions or outputs that deviate from reality. Drawing on neuroscience and machine learning research, we highlight the predictive processes that underlie human and artificial thought. In humans, complex neural mechanisms interpret sensory information under uncertainty, sometimes filling in gaps and creating false perceptions. This inference occurs hierarchically: higher cortical levels send top-down predictions to lower-level regions, while mismatches (prediction errors) propagate upward to refine the model. LLMs, in contrast, rely on auto-regressive modeling of text and can generate erroneous statements in the absence of robust grounding. Despite these different foundations - biological versus computational - the similarities in their predictive architectures help explain why hallucinations occur. We propose that the propensity to generate incorrect or confabulated responses may be an inherent feature of advanced intelligence. In both humans and AI, adaptive predictive processes aim to make sense of incomplete information and anticipate future states, fostering creativity and flexibility, but also introducing the risk of errors. Our analysis illuminates how factors such as feedback, grounding, and error correction affect the likelihood of 'being wrong' in each system. We suggest that mitigating AI hallucinations (e.g., through improved training, post-processing, or knowledge-grounding methods) may also shed light on human cognitive processes, revealing how error-prone predictions can be harnessed for innovation without compromising reliability. By exploring these converging and divergent mechanisms, the paper underscores the broader implications for advancing both AI reliability and scientific understanding of human thought.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06049">The Role of Affective States in Computational Psychiatry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06286">A 7T fMRI dataset of synthetic images for out-of-distribution modeling of vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.

                arXiv:2503.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central aims of neuroscience is to reliably predict the behavioral response of an organism using its neural activity. If possible, this implies we can causally manipulate the neural response and design brain-computer-interface systems to alter behavior, and vice-versa. Hence, predictions play an important role in both fundamental neuroscience and its applications. Can we predict the neural and behavioral states of an organism at any given time? Can we predict behavioral states using neural states, and vice-versa, and is there a memory-component required to reliably predict such states? Are the predictions computable within a given timescale to meaningfully stimulate and make the system reach the desired states? Through a series of mathematical treatments, such conjectures and questions are discussed. Answering them might be key for future developments in understanding intelligence and designing brain-computer-interfaces.

                arXiv:2503.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons display spontaneous spiking (in the absence of stimulus signals) as well as a characteristic response to time-dependent external stimuli. In a simple but important class of stochastic neuron models, the integrate-and-fire model with Gaussian current noise, both aspects can mathematically be related via fluctuation-response relations (FRRs) as has been shown recently. Here we extend the class of FRRs to include the susceptibilities of the membrane voltage and subthreshold voltage nonlinearity as well as the power spectrum of the membrane voltage. For a simple but often considered IF model, the leaky IF model with white Gaussian noise, we exploit the FRRs and derive explicit expressions for the power spectrum and susceptibility of the subthreshold membrane voltage. We also put forward a relation between the response functions of the spike train and membrane voltage, a response-response relation (RRR) that holds true for a more general setting than considered in most parts of the paper. For the generalized IF model with an adaptation current and colored Gaussian noise we derive an FRR and an RRR. We briefly discuss useful applications of the derived FRRs and RRRs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138">System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

                arXiv:2404.18775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new computational-level objective function for theoretical biology and theoretical neuroscience that combines: reinforcement learning, the study of learning with feedback via rewards; rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that deals with compressing signals to retain relevant information; and computational mechanics, the study of minimal sufficient statistics of prediction also known as causal states. We highlight why this proposal is likely only an approximation, but is likely to be an interesting one, and propose a new algorithm for evaluating it to obtain the newly-coined ``reward-rate manifold''. The performance of real and artificial agents in partially observable environments can be newly benchmarked using these reward-rate manifolds. Finally, we describe experiments that can probe whether or not biological organisms are resource-rational reinforcement learners, using as an example maximin strategies, as bacteria have been shown to be approximate maximiners -- doing their best in the worst-case environment, regardless of what is actually happening.

                arXiv:2407.16589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in a polar representation of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic disk. Here, we use a geometric score, entirely based on the computation of distances between nodes in the latent space, to measure the effect of a perturbation on the nodes. Precisely, the score is a local measure of distortion in the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain network dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from diffusion weighted (DWI) and functional (fMRI) magnetic resonance imaging scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method more accurately identifies the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormalities detected in memory related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing the progression of the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00721">A Turing Test for Artificial Nets devoted to model Human Vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.00721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this 2022 work we argued that, despite claims about successful modeling of the visual brain using artificial nets, the problem is far from being solved (even for low-level vision). Examples of open issues include: where should we read from ANNs in order to reproduce human behavior?, this ad-hoc read-out is considered part of the brain model or not?, should we use artificial psychophysics or artificial physiology?, in the case of ANNs, artificial experiments should literally match the experiments done with humans?. There is a clear need of rigorous procedures for experimental tests for ANNs devoted to model the visual brain, and more generally, to understand ANNs devoted to generic vision tasks. Following our experience in using low-level facts from Quantitative Visual Neuroscience in computer vision, in this work we presented the idea of developing a low-level dataset compiling the basic spatio-temporal and chromatic facts that are known to happen in the retina-V1 pathway, and they are not currently available in existing databases such as BrainScore. In our results we checked the behavior of three recently proposed models with similar architecture: (1) A parametric model tuned via Maximum Differentiation [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 15, Martinez et al. PLOS 18, Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 19], (2) A non-parametric model called PerceptNet tuned to maximize the correlation with human opinion on subjective distortions [Hepburn et al. IEEE ICIP 19], and (3) A model with the same encoder as PerceptNet, but tuned for image segmentation (published as Hernandez-Camara et al. Patt.Recogn.Lett. 23). Results on 10 compelling psycho/physio visual facts show that the first model is the one with closer behavior to the humans in terms of receptive fields, but more interestingly, on the nonlinear behavior when facing complex spatio-chromatic patterns of a range of luminances and contrasts.

Abstract: Analyzing functional brain networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding psychiatric disorders and addictive behaviors. While existing fMRI-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) show considerable promise for feature extraction, they often fall short in characterizing complex relationships between brain regions and demographic factors and accounting for interpretable variables linked to psychiatric conditions. We propose NeuroTree to overcome these limitations, integrating a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework leverages an attention mechanism to optimize functional connectivity (FC), thereby enhancing dynamic FC feature learning for brain disease classification. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets and provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns. These findings underscore the model's efficacy in predicting psychiatric disorders and elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.

                arXiv:2503.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate sign language understanding serves as a crucial communication channel for individuals with disabilities. Current sign language translation algorithms predominantly rely on RGB frames, which may be limited by fixed frame rates, variable lighting conditions, and motion blur caused by rapid hand movements. Inspired by the recent successful application of event cameras in other fields, we propose to leverage event streams to assist RGB cameras in capturing gesture data, addressing the various challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale RGB-Event sign language translation dataset using the DVS346 camera, termed VECSL, which contains 15,676 RGB-Event samples, 15,191 glosses, and covers 2,568 Chinese characters. These samples were gathered across a diverse range of indoor and outdoor environments, capturing multiple viewing angles, varying light intensities, and different camera motions. Due to the absence of benchmark algorithms for comparison in this new task, we retrained and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art SLT algorithms, and believe that this benchmark can effectively support subsequent related research. Additionally, we propose a novel RGB-Event sign language translation framework (i.e., M$^2$-SLT) that incorporates fine-grained micro-sign and coarse-grained macro-sign retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results on the proposed dataset. Both the source code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL.

                arXiv:2410.23619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven and biologically inspired operation, are well-suited for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. Neural coding, critical to SNNs, determines how information is represented via spikes. Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) coding, which uses a single spike per neuron, offers extreme sparsity and energy efficiency but suffers from unstable training and low accuracy due to its sparse firing. To address these challenges, we propose a training framework incorporating parameter initialization, training normalization, temporal output decoding, and pooling layer re-evaluation. The proposed parameter initialization and training normalization mitigate signal diminishing and gradient vanishing to stabilize training. The output decoding method aggregates temporal spikes to encourage earlier firing, thereby reducing the latency. The re-evaluation of the pooling layer indicates that average-pooling keeps the single-spike characteristic and that max-pooling should be avoided. Experiments show the framework stabilizes and accelerates training, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for TTFS SNNs on MNIST (99.48%), Fashion-MNIST (92.90%), CIFAR10 (90.56%), and DVS Gesture (95.83%).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15003">Neural Snowflakes: Universal Latent Graph Inference via Trainable Latent Geometries</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.

                arXiv:2402.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The missing mass refers to the proportion of data points in an unknown population of classifier inputs that belong to classes not present in the classifier's training data, which is assumed to be a random sample from that unknown population. We find that in expectation the missing mass is entirely determined by the number $f_k$ of classes that do appear in the training data the same number of times and an exponentially decaying error. While this is the first precise characterization of the expected missing mass in terms of the sample, the induced estimator suffers from an impractically high variance. However, our theory suggests a large search space of nearly unbiased estimators that can be searched effectively and efficiently. Hence, we cast distribution-free estimation as an optimization problem to find a distribution-specific estimator with a minimized mean-squared error (MSE), given only the sample. In our experiments, our search algorithm discovers estimators that have a substantially smaller MSE than the state-of-the-art Good-Turing estimator. This holds for over 93% of runs when there are at least as many samples as classes. Our estimators' MSE is roughly 80% of the Good-Turing estimator's.

                arXiv:2405.04620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

                arXiv:2407.13663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projection pursuit (PP) guided tour optimizes a criterion function, known as the PP index, to gradually reveal projections of interest from high-dimensional data through animation. Optimization of some PP indexes can be non-trivial, if they are non-smooth functions, or when the optimum has a small "squint angle", detectable only from close proximity. Here, measures for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are defined. These are used to investigate the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO), for optimizing PP indexes. The performance of JSO in detecting the target pattern (pipe shape) is compared with existing optimizers in PP. Additionally, JSO's performance on detecting the sine-wave shape is evaluated using different PP indexes (hence different smoothness and squintability) across various data dimensions (d = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and JSO hyper-parameters. We observe empirically that higher squintability improves the success rate of the PP index optimization, while smoothness has no significant effect. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the R package, `tourr`, and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability measures are implemented in the `ferrn` package.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885">Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.

                arXiv:2411.15235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate new concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic environments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks often overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent approaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection, effectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While effective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward knowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In this work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual Learning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix representations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle highly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto pseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while simultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination of shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and plasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature representations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks validate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced forgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

">openretina: Collaborative Retina Modelling Across Datasets and Species</a></h4>

              
                Studying the retina plays a crucial role in understanding how the visual world is translated into the brains language. As a stand-alone neural circuit with easily controllable input, the retina provides a unique opportunity to develop a complete and quantitatively precise model of a computational module in the brain. However, decades of data and models remain fragmente across labs and approaches. To address this, we have launched an open-source retina modelling platform on a shared GitHub repository, aiming to provide a unified data and modelling framework across species, recording techniques, stimulus conditions, and use cases. Our initial release consists of a Python package, openretina, a modelling framework based on PyTorch, which we designed for optimal accessibility and extensibility. The package includes different variations on a basic Core + Readout model architecture, easily adaptable dataloaders, integration with modern deep learning libraries, and methods for performing in-silico experiments and analyses on the models. We illustrate the versatility of the package by providing dataloaders and pre-trained models for data from several laboratories and studies across species. With this starter pack in place, openretina can be used within minutes. Through step-by-step examples, we here provide retina researchers of diverse backgrounds a hands-on introduction to modelling, including using models as tools for visualising retinal computations, generating and testing hypotheses, and guiding experimental design.

">A genetic signature of resistance to activity-based anorexia in striatal projecting cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex psychiatric disorder characterised by severe pathological weight loss and persistent cognitive inflexibility. Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AN. However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model recapitulates many aspects of the behavioural phenotypes of AN in humans and we have previously demonstrated that suppressing neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) circuit prevented pathological weight loss in ABA rats. Here, we used a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional changes within this neural pathway associated with susceptibility to ABA in female rats. We reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA. These findings provide novel insights into circuit-specific gene expression patterns that may contribute to susceptibility to developing AN in humans and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

">Using a female-specific isoform of doublesex to explore male-specific hearing in mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                Animal reproduction relies on elaborate divisions of labour and multiple dimorphisms between the sexes. Primary dimorphisms affect core elements of reproduction, secondary dimorphisms affect more indirect traits, including complex behaviours. In disease-transmitting mosquitoes, males locate females acoustically prior to copulation (phonotaxis). No comparable acoustic behaviour is known for females. As a result, the males ears and hearing performance have evolved to become substantially more complex. Sex-specific hearing in mosquitoes is in part controlled by the doublesex (dsx) gene. Intriguingly, dsx forms a linker between primary and secondary dimorphisms: spermatogenesis and ear morphogenesis share considerable molecular overlap and both depend on dsx expression patterns. We have combined transcriptomics with functional-anatomical analyses to dissect dsx-dependent hearing in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. By cross-linking our auditory findings to the genetic bases of spermatogenesis we advance the molecular understanding of sex-specific hearing mechanisms in insects, highlighting the special roles of ciliary factors therein.

">Development of Potent, Selective cPLA2 Inhibitors for Targeting Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuroinflammation plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) enzyme is a critical mediator of inflammatory lipid signaling pathways. Here we investigate the therapeutic potential of novel cPLA2 inhibitors in modulating neuroinflammation in AD. By leveraging the giga-scale V-SYNTHES 2.0 virtual screening in on-demand chemical space and conducting two rounds of optimization for potency and selectivity, we have identified BRI-50460, achieving an IC50 of 0.88 nM in cellular assays of cPLA2 activity. In vivo studies revealed favorable brain-to-plasma ratios, highlighting the ability of BRI-50460 to penetrate the central nervous system, potentially modulating neuroinflammatory pathways and restoring lipid homeostasis. In cultured astrocytes and neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, BRI-50460 mitigates the effects of amyloid beta 42 oligomers on cPLA2 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic and dendritic reduction. Our results suggest that small molecule inhibitors of the cPLA2 enzyme can modulate the downstream inflammatory lipid signaling pathways, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

">Motivational Cognitive Maps for Self-Regulated Autonomous Navigation</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian hippocampal formation plays a critical role in efficient and flexible navigation. Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatial tuning, characterized by increased firing rates when an animal occupies specific locations in its environment. However, the mechanisms underlying the encoding of spatial information by hippocampal place cells remain not fully understood. Evidence suggests that spatial preferences are shaped by multimodal sensory inputs. Yet, existing hippocampal models typically rely on a single sensory modality, overlooking the role of interoceptive information in the formation of cognitive maps. In this paper, we introduce the Motivational Hippocampal Autoencoder (MoHA), a biologically inspired model that integrates interoceptive (motivational) and exteroceptive (visual) information to generate motivationally modulated cognitive maps. MoHA captures key hippocampal firing properties across different motivational states and, when embedded in a reinforcement learning agent, generates adaptive internal representations that drive goal-directed foraging behavior. Grounded in the principle of biological autonomy, MoHA enables the agent to dynamically adjust its navigation strategies based on internal drives, ensuring that behavior remains flexible and context-dependent. Our results show the benefits of integrating motivational cognitive maps into artificial agents with a varying set of goals, laying the foundation for self-regulated multi-objective reinforcement learning.

	<p>Background: Astrocytes play a key role in the inflammatory process accompanying various neurological diseases. Extracellular ATP accompanies inflammatory processes in the brain, but its effect on lipid mediators (oxylipins) in astrocytes remains elusive. Metformin is a hypoglycemic drug with an anti-inflammatory effect that has been actively investigated in the context of therapy for neuroinflammation, but its mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the effects of ATP on inflammatory markers and oxylipin profiles; determine the dependence of these effects on the adaptation of astrocytes to high glucose levels; and evaluate the possibility of modulating ATP effects using metformin. Methods: We estimated the ATP-mediated response of primary rat astrocytes cultured at normal (NG, 5 mM) and high (HG, 22.5 mM) glucose concentrations for 48 h before stimulation. Cell responses were assessed by monitoring changes in the expression of inflammatory markers (TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, iNOS, and COX-2) and the synthesis of oxylipins (41 compounds), assayed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Intracellular pathways were assessed by analyzing the phosphorylation of p38; ERK MAPK; transcription factors STAT3 and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B; and the enzymes mediating oxylipin synthesis, COX-1 and cPLA2. Results: The stimulation of cells with ATP does not affect the expression of pro-inflammatory markers, increases the activities of p38 and ERK MAPKs, and activates oxylipin synthesis, shifting the profiles toward an increase in anti-inflammatory compounds (PGD2, PGA2, 12-HHT, and 18-HEPE). The ATP effects are reduced in HG astrocytes. Metformin potentiated ATP-induced oxylipin synthesis (11-HETE, PGD2, 12-HHT, 15-HETE, 13-HDoHE, and 15-HETrE), which was predominantly evident in NG cells. Conclusions: Our data provide new evidence showing that ATP induces the release of anti-inflammatory oxylipins, and metformin enhances these effects. These results should be considered in the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating astrocyte function in various pathologies.</p>

                Japanese philosopher Tanabe Hajime (1885–1962) not only discussed religion in ways that were rooted in the fundamental claims of his writings, such as Shinran in Philosophy as Metanoetics (1946), but he also made proposals on religion, as in Demonstration of Christianity (1948), where he advocated for the need for a “second religious reformation.” For Tanabe, philosophy and religion (along with science) are fused in a specific way, and it is possible to find a vision of religion to be aimed for that is worth considering as a theory of religion among Japanese philosophers. To examine the theory of religion of Tanabe, this study focuses on the work, Demonstration of Christianity, and other works from the perspective of religious studies. In Demonstration of Christianity, the concept of absolute religion toward the second religious reformation is envisioned based on Tanabe’s dialectics of the absolute mediation, and a discussion on his world religion can be found, although it is limited to Christianity and some Buddhist sects. Reflecting his absolute dialectic, Tanabe says that this world religion was established through the absolute mediation of Christianity with “Nembutsu-Zen ” (the unification of Pure Land Buddhism and Zen Buddhism). One cannot deny the impression of Christocentrism in these discussions, but they are in the result of Tanabe’s thoroughness in philosophy. What can be drawn from these discussions is that Tanabe’s theory of religion is strongly connected to Platonism, which he considered the root of his dialectics. For example, the third article in Existence, Love, and Practice(1947), “Self-Transcendence in Platonism and Faith in Gospel.” Tanabe’s argument reveals the characteristics of conceiving a new religion that combines Buddhism and Christianity, philosophy, and religion through a creative interpretation of Platonism, the source of Western thought where philosophy and religion are inseparably linked.

                Background The number of overweight people (BMI 25–29.9kg.m-2) in the world is increasing, which increases the risk of health problems and psychological difficulties. To reduce these risks, it is imperative to address unhealthy habits including food and exercise. This qualitative study aimed to explore the needs, perceptions, and preferences of overweight individuals on tailored exercise programs that incorporate educational videos. Methodology Forty Individuals between the age of 18-30 years with a BMI of 25-29.9kg.m-2 were included in the study using Purposive sampling from October 2023 to November 2023. Semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted for 45-60 minutes approximately among both active and inactive overweight individuals by a researcher trained in qualitative research. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was performed using inductive and deductive approaches to identify the recurrent patterns, themes, and insights in the transcribed interviews. Results 8 themes and 44 subthemes emerged from the analysis, helping to shed light on the needs, perceptions, and preferences that overweight individuals experience when it comes to their preference for a customized exercise program provided through educational video. The participants wanted personalized regimens that catered to their requirements and levels of fitness. Conclusion In summary, the findings emphasize the value of educational videos that are easy to use, visually appealing, and supported by science. These videos should emphasize technique, varying levels of difficulty, and brief sessions.

This ternary hybrid nanofluid (Al₂O₃–Cu–TiO₂/C₂H₆O₂) has potential applications in cooling systems, biomedical uses for targeted drug delivery and hyperthermia treatments, heat exchangers, and polymer processing techniques like extrusion and casting. Methods This study will examine the combined effects of Weissenberg number, power law index, nanoparticle volume fraction, viscous dissipation, magnetic field, heat generation, nonlinear thermal radiation, temperature ratio, Joule heating, Brownian motion, thermophoresis, porous permeability, variable thermal conductivity, Eckert number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number, chemical reaction, velocity ratio, and Forchheimer number on the electrical conductivity of unsteady flow in tangent hyperbolic ternary hybrid nanofluids. The governing equations are transformed into similarity equations using appropriate transformations and solved numerically with the MATLAB BVP5C package. The results are validated against data from published articles to ensure reproducibility. Results The findings reveal that an increase in the Weissenberg and Forchheimer numbers reduces the velocity profile, while the temperature distribution increases. The variable thermal conductivity parameter (Γ) leads to a higher temperature profile, indicating improved heat transfer. Higher nanoparticle concentrations in the nanofluids and hybrid nanofluids result in enhanced skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. Ternary hybrid nanofluids show the most significant improvement in heat transfer and thermal conductivity. Conclusions Ternary hybrid nanofluids significantly enhance heat and mass transfer, showing potential for applications in cooling systems, drug delivery, and polymer processing. The numerical results are consistent with previous research, confirming the reliability and reproducibility of the findings.

                Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant global health threat, with increasing prevalence worldwide, including in Indonesia. Despite the public health impact, comprehensive data on the burden of CRE in Indonesia remains fragmented. This protocol outlines a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to estimate the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia, summarize trends over time, and identify key resistance mechanisms. Methods We will conduct a systematic search across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and local Indonesian databases, for studies reporting the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia from 2004 to 2024. Eligibility criteria include observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control) and surveillance reports. Data extraction will focus on CRE prevalence, bacterial species, sample types, resistance mechanisms, and study settings (hospital vs. community). Quality assessment of studies will be performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence, and subgroup analysis will explore variations by geographical region, period, and healthcare setting. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive overview of CRE prevalence in Indonesia, contributing to an improved understanding of the national burden and resistance patterns. The findings will guide public health policies and inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts in Indonesia. Registration PROSPERO CRD42024580177

                Background Globalization, urbanization, and economic development has had an influence on the dining out behaviour in general and fine dining in particular. The objective of this systematic review is identifying the factors affecting fine dining selection and to understand the fine dining restaurant dynamics. Methods In the context of fine dining, both quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in South Asian countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—were included in this review. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and summarised using narrative synthesis. The search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Google Scholar. The two-stage screening was independently done by two authors in two stages (titles/abstracts, and full texts) for inclusion, with discrepancies resolved by involvement of a third reviewer. Data was extracted using a piloted form and the results are presented as a narrative summary and in tabular format. Results Fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria after de-duplication and screening and were included in the review. These studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan and were mostly quantitative in nature. The outcomes assessed in the studies were factors affecting decision to choose fine dine restaurant, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, willingness to pay, and food wastage. Conclusion There is limited literature on types of evidence available related to fine dining in South Asia. The substantial gap extends to the methodological aspect and the outcomes assessed in the fine dining restaurant segment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1073/v2?src=rss">A novel hybrid genetic algorithm and Nelder-Mead approach and it’s application for parameter estimation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

                <p>by Elsje J Burgers, Raju P Sharma, Carl Joshua S Eugenio, Muriel M Heldring, Lukas S Wijaya, Bob van de Water, Joost B Beltman</p>

Cells exposed to toxicants, such as drugs, activate a wide variety of stress pathways, often simultaneously. Two important pathways that can influence cell fate and consequently adverse reactions are the Oxidative Stress Response (OSR) and the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Previous studies have presented evidence of crosstalk between the OSR and DDR. We aimed to develop computational models to describe experimentally observed dynamics of both OSR and DDR proteins in liver (HepG2) cells <i>in vitro</i> upon exposure to various concentrations of either diethyl maleate (DEM; an agent primarily invoking oxidative stress) or etoposide (an agent primarily causing DNA damage). With these models, we aimed to identify the key interactions that cause crosstalk and their importance in describing protein dynamics. We developed a new model for the OSR pathway, coupled it to a previously developed model for the DDR pathway, and extended the resulting combined model based on multiple potential modes of crosstalk described in the literature. The different models were applied to previously published data of HepG2 GFP-reporter cells with time-dynamic information on the relative amount of proteins important for the OSR (NRF2, SRXN1) or DDR (p53, p21, BTG2 and MDM2). The developed models properly described key OSR and DDR protein dynamics, and <i>in silico</i> knockdowns of key model components in most cases led to a moderate effect on the connected pathway. The largest effect occurred after knockdown of p21, which resulted in a substantial decrease in NRF2 and SRXN1. We expect these models could play a role in adversity predictions by coupling our models with other models that predict cell fate or adversity based on the expression of specific proteins.

                <p>by Larissa M. Oprysk, Maribel Vazquez, Troy Shinbrot</p>

Experiments demonstrate that individual cells that wander stochastically can migrate persistently as a cluster. We show by simulating cells and their interactions that collective migration by omnidirectional cells is a generic phenomenon that can be expected to arise whenever (a) leading and trailing cells migrate randomly, and (b) leading cells are more closely packed than trailing neighbors. The first condition implies that noise is essential to cluster motion, while the second implies that an internal cohesion gradient can drive external motion of a cluster. Unlike other swarming phenomena, we find that this effect is driven by cohesion asymmetry near the leading cell, and motion of interior cells contribute minimally – and in fact interfere with – a cluster’s persistent migration.

                Anthropomorphism studies have been conducted over the past decade; however, there is a void in the literature that provides an overview of anthropomorphism studies in business, management, and accounting. This article provides an in-depth analysis and mapping of major studies in the literature linked to anthropomorphism over the last 14 years by providing a topical classification consistent with present and future anthropomorphism research. The critical function of anthropomorphism in marketing communication tactics necessitates a thorough evaluation that is currently lacking, supplementing past studies to support academics’ and practitioners' interests in performing a thorough analysis of anthropomorphism in future marketing communication trends. This article summarizes studies on anthropomorphism in business, management, and accounting published in Scopus-indexed journals between 2010 and 2024 using Bibliometric-R and VOS viewer in compliance with the PRISMA protocol. The findings highlight significant trends in the articles, including the evolution of the literature (theories and methodologies employed), publications, authors, countries, journal performance, and trends in supporting research themes in the past, present, and future. Research on anthropomorphism has grown rapidly, particularly from 2022 to 2024. This paper provides a complete summary of the fragmented literature to guide future research.

                Introduction Inserting a peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is becoming essential. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PICC line-related complications. Methods A retrospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 2012 and 2019 at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia. In total, 120 neonates were included in this study. Data on PICC line-related complications, including infection, thrombosis, occlusion, leakage, pericardial effusion, and neonatal death, were collected from medical records. Risk factors for PICC line-related complications were assessed using the chi-square test. Results PICC complications occurred in 28 (23.3%) of the 120 PICCs. The incidence of proven infection was (11.7%), leakage (10%), local infection (4.2%), and thrombosis (0.8%), and there were no deaths. The rate of complications was higher among neonates with low gestational age (24-26 weeks), extremely low birth weight, stay for 30 days or more, and older age (aged 10-14 days). Conclusion Findings from this study showed that one out of five neonates with PICC at the NICU experienced a PICC line-related complication, with infections and leakage being the most common complications. In the current study, PICC line-related complications were significantly associated with neonatal birth weight, gestational age, and length of stay.

                Background India records the highest number of suicide deaths globally, but suicide prevention efforts are hindered by a lack of trained personnel within the public health system. Given that an index suicide attempt is a strong predictor of future suicide, intervening with individuals who have recently attempted suicide is a targeted prevention approach that can be delivered within the public health system and has potential to be scaled up across low-resource settings. Aim To test the implementation and preliminary effectiveness of Contact and Safety Planning (CASP) in reducing suicidal behaviour and symptoms of depression among adults with a recent suicide attempt in Chhattisgarh. Methods We will carry out a non-randomized, controlled pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, adoption, reach, implementation (including cost) and preliminary effectiveness of CASP when delivered by health workers – emergency nurses and Community Health Officers – in two districts of Chhattisgarh (n=250). The control group will receive Enhanced Usual Care, consisting of telephonic counselling by trained District Mental Health (n=250) program staff.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-278/v1?src=rss">Understanding networking behaviors among Indian startups: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage past work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

                Background The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens and emerging new microbes due to climate change highlight the urgent need for alternative antimicrobials. Plants, as they adapt to environmental shifts, produce diverse metabolites with potent antibacterial properties, offering a sustainable source to combat antibiotic resistance and emerging microbial threats. In this context, Citrullus colocynthis fruits, known for their antimicrobial activity and adaptation to the hot Gulf region, were screened to identify accessions with strong antibacterial activity and distinct metabolic profiles. Methods The rinds and pulps of three C. colocynthis accessions were screened for their effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) tests determined activity levels, and GC-MS/MS metabolic profiling analyzed the chemical composition of rind and pulp extracts. Enrichment and network analyses were performed to identify metabolic pathways and potential bacterial targets. Results Rind extracts demonstrated stronger antibacterial activity than pulp, with accession S2 showing the highest activity against S. aureus (MIC50 = 15.74 μg/ml), outperforming other accessions. Metabolic profiling revealed distinct metabolite clusters between rind and pulp, with the rind containing unique compounds like butyric acid, α-linolenic acid, and β-sitosterol. Enrichment analysis indicated that unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and other fatty acid metabolism pathways were enriched in the accession S2 rind, supporting its antibacterial potency. Network analysis pinpointed bacterial fatty acid synthase enzymes (FabZ, FabI, and FabH) as potential S. aureus targets of C. colocynthis rind fatty acids. Conclusions The distinct metabolic profiles and strong antibacterial activity of C. colocynthis rind, especially in accession S2, underscore its potential as a sustainable source for plant-based nutraceuticals. Its unique adaptability and antimicrobial properties present a promising strategy for combating multidrug-resistant pathogens.

                How do neurons cope with chronic stress? In a recent study using blind Drosophila models, Shekhar and colleagues uncovered that chronic sensory deprivation induces brain-wide accumulation of aggregates sequestering transcription factors of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). However, this protective mechanism prevents cells from triggering adapted transcriptional responses upon exogenous stress.

                Higginbotham et al. show that inflammatory pain increases opioid-evoked dopamine neuron activity to promote fentanyl use selectively in males. Ovarian hormones offer females protection, but estradiol’s role is pain-context dependent and sex specific. These findings highlight a unique interaction between hormonal and pain states that may underlie sex differences in opioid misuse liability.

We have found that mechano-sensitive feedback on cytoskeletal tension gives rise to morphological bistability, and that the same mechanical perturbation can have drastically different effects on morphogenesis depending on the timing of application. This multicellular bistability can provide robustness to developmental systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100730">The asymmetric expression of HSPA2 in blastomeres governs the first embryonic cell-fate decision</a></h4>

              
                The first cell-fate decision is the process by which cells of an embryo take on distinct lineage identities for the first time, thus representing the beginning of developmental patterning. Here, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2), a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family, is asymmetrically expressed in the late 2-cell stage of mouse embryos. The knockdown of <i>Hspa2</i> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres prevented its progeny predominantly towards the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. In contrast, the overexpression of <i>Hspa2</i> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres did not induce the blastomere to differentiate towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HSPA2 interacted with CARM1 and its levels correlated with ICM-associated genes. Collectively, our results identify HSPA2 as a critical early regulator of the first cell-fate decision in mammalian 2-cell embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100822">Dopamine increases protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons enabling dopamine-dependent LTP</a></h4>

              
                The reward and novelty-related neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesised proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzosko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here, we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP), which is mediated via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis. Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96591">Single-nucleus multiomics reveals the gene regulatory networks underlying sex determination of murine primordial germ cells</a></h4>

              
                Accurate specification of female and male germ cells during embryonic development is critical for sexual reproduction. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the bipotential precursors of mature gametes that commit to an oogenic or spermatogenic fate in response to sex-determining cues from the fetal gonad. The critical processes required for PGCs to integrate and respond to signals from the somatic environment in gonads are not well understood. In this study, we developed the first single-nucleus multiomics map of chromatin accessibility and gene expression during murine PGC development in both XX and XY embryos. Profiling of cell-type-specific transcriptomes and regions of open chromatin from the same cell captured the molecular signatures and gene networks underlying PGC sex determination. Joint RNA and ATAC data for single PGCs resolved previously unreported PGC subpopulations and cataloged a multimodal reference atlas of differentiating PGC clusters. We discovered that regulatory element accessibility precedes gene expression during PGC development, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime PGC lineage commitment prior to differentiation. Similarly, we found that sexual dimorphism in chromatin accessibility and gene expression increased temporally in PGCs. Combining single-nucleus sequencing data, we computationally mapped the cohort of transcription factors that regulate the expression of sexually dimorphic genes in PGCs. For example, the gene regulatory networks of XX PGCs are enriched for the transcription factors, TFAP2c, TCFL5, GATA2, MGA, NR6A1, TBX4, and ZFX. Sex-specific enrichment of the forkhead-box and POU6 families of transcription factors was also observed in XY PGCs. Finally, we determined the temporal expression patterns of WNT, BMP, and RA signaling during PGC sex determination, and our discovery analyses identified potentially new cell communication pathways between supporting cells and PGCs. Our results illustrate the diversity of factors involved in programming PGCs toward a sex-specific fate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99548">Aminergic and peptidergic modulation of insulin-producing cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Insulin plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Since metabolic demands are highly dynamic, insulin release needs to be constantly adjusted. These adjustments are mediated by different pathways, most prominently the blood glucose level, but also by feedforward signals from motor circuits and different neuromodulatory systems. Here, we analyze how neuromodulatory inputs control the activity of the main source of insulin in <i>Drosophila –</i> a population of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) located in the brain. IPCs are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, but their location makes them accessible for in vivo recordings in intact animals. We characterized functional inputs to IPCs using single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis, anatomical receptor expression mapping, connectomics, and an optogenetics-based ‘intrinsic pharmacology’ approach. Our results show that the IPC population expresses a variety of receptors for neuromodulators and classical neurotransmitters. Interestingly, IPCs exhibit heterogeneous receptor profiles, suggesting that the IPC population can be modulated differentially. This is supported by electrophysiological recordings from IPCs, which we performed while activating different populations of modulatory neurons. Our analysis revealed that some modulatory inputs have heterogeneous effects on the IPC activity, such that they inhibit one subset of IPCs, while exciting another. Monitoring calcium activity across the IPC population uncovered that these heterogeneous responses occur simultaneously. Certain neuromodulatory populations shifted the IPC population activity towards an excited state, while others shifted it towards inhibition. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, multi-level analysis of neuromodulation in the insulinergic system of <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101125">Amidase and lysozyme dual functions in TseP reveal a new family of chimeric effectors in the type VI secretion system</a></h4>

              
                Peptidoglycan (PG) serves as an essential target for antimicrobial development. An overlooked reservoir of antimicrobials lies in the form of PG-hydrolyzing enzymes naturally produced for polymicrobial competition, particularly those associated with the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Here, we report that a T6SS effector TseP, from <i>Aeromonas dhakensis</i>, represents a family of effectors with dual amidase-lysozyme activities. In vitro PG-digestion coupled with LC-MS analysis revealed the N-domain’s amidase activity, which is neutralized by either catalytic mutations or the presence of the immunity protein TsiP. The N-domain, but not the C-domain, of TseP is sufficient to restore T6SS secretion in T6SS-defective mutants, underscoring its critical structural role. Using pull-down and secretion assays, we showed that these two domains interact directly with a carrier protein VgrG2 and can be secreted separately. Homologs in <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> exhibited analogous dual functions. Additionally, N- and C-domains display distinctive GC contents, suggesting an evolutionary fusion event. By altering the surface charge through structural-guided design, we engineered the TseP<sup>C4+</sup> effector that successfully lyses otherwise resistant <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> cells, enabling the T6SS to inhibit <i>B. subtilis</i> in a contact-independent manner. This research uncovers TseP as a new family of bifunctional chimeric effectors targeting PG, offering a potential strategy to harness these proteins in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

">Stimulus dependencies---rather than next-word prediction---can explain pre-onset brain encoding during natural listening</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is thought to constantly predict future words during language processing. Recently, a new approach to investigating linguistic predictions emerged which aims to capture predictive pre-activation directly by using neural network representations of words to predict brain activity prior to word onset. However, it is unclear what exactly is driving the predictability of pre-stimulus brain activity. Here we show, across two datasets, that both proposed hallmarks of neural pre-activation?i.e. (i) pre-onset brain response predictability and (ii) its modulation by word expectedness?is not only observed in brain responses, but also in representations of the stimulus material itself. We show that various structural and incidental dependencies existing in natural language can explain previously reported hallmarks of prediction without assuming any pre-activation in the neural data. This suggests that pre-onset prediction of brain activity might only reflect dependencies within the stimulus material rather than predictive computations, and questions the extent to which this new prediction-based method can be used to study prediction in the brain.

">Uncovering functional connectivity patterns predictive of cognition in youth using interpretable predictive modeling</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI studies have identified functional connectivity (FC) patterns associated with behavioral traits using whole-brain or region-wise predictive models. However, whole-brain approaches often suffer from limited generalizability and interpretability due to the high-dimensionality of FC data. Conversely, region-wise models inherently isolate predictions, ineffective for characterizing contributions of the whole brain FC patterns in predicting a target trait. In this study, we propose an interpretable predictive model that learns fine-grained FC patterns predictive of behavioral traits, jointly at the regional and participant levels, to characterize the overall association of FC patterns with a target trait. Our model learns both a relevance score and a dedicated prediction model for each brain region, then integrates the regional predictions to generate a participant-level prediction, capturing the collective association of FC patterns with the trait. We validated our method using FC data from 6798 participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study for predicting cognition. Our interpretable predictive model identified the cingulo-parietal, retrosplenial-temporal, dorsal attention, salience, and cingulo-opercular networks as collectively predictive of cognitive traits. The interpretable model significantly improved prediction accuracy and facilitated the characterization of fine-grained differences in FC patterns across cognitive domains. Furthermore, the learned relevance scores enhanced region-wise predictions of longitudinal cognitive measures in the ABCD cohort and cognitive traits in an external Human Connectome Project Development (HCP-D) cohort. These findings suggest that our method effectively characterizes generalizable and fine-grained FC patterns linked to cognition in youth.

">Dynamic vs. Static Facial Color Changes: Evidence for Terminal Color Dominance in Expression Recognition</a></h4>

              
                Facial color is closely linked to the perception of emotion, with reddish tones often associated with anger. While previous studies have shown that static reddish facial tones enhance this perception, it remains unclear whether dynamic changes in facial color further amplify this effect. This study investigated how variations in facial color influence the perception of expression using a judgment task that involved morphed facial stimuli (fearful to angry). The participants evaluated facial expressions under two conditions: faces with dynamic color changes and faces with static colors. Experiment 1 compared red (CIELAB a*+) faces to original-colored faces, and Experiment 2 compared green (a*-) faces to original-colored faces. Neither experiment revealed significant differences between dynamic and static facial colors. However, faces with a final reddish color (higher a* value) were more likely to be perceived as angry. These findings suggest that the final facial color influences the perception of anger independent of whether the color change is dynamic or static. Our findings support the idea that the recognition of anger is modulated by the relationship between an angry expression and the color red and provide a new perspective on facial color changes in the interaction between facial expression and facial color.

">Proteomic characterization of the Alzheimer's disease risk factor BIN1 interactome</a></h4>

              
                The gene BIN1 is the second-largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). It is expressed in neurons and glia in the brain as cell-type specific and ubiquitous isoforms. BIN1 is an adaptor protein that regulates membrane dynamics in many cell types. Previously, we reported that BIN1 predominantly localizes to presynaptic terminals in neurons and regulates presynaptic vesicular release. However, the function of neuronal BIN1 in relation to LOAD is not yet fully understood. A significant gap in the field is the unbiased characterization of neuronal BIN1-interacting proteins and proximal neighbors. To address this gap and help define the functions of neuronal BIN1 in the brain, we employed TurboID-based proximity labeling to identify proteins biotinylated by the neuronal BIN1 isoform 1-TurboID fusion protein (BIN1iso1-TID) in cultured mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells in vitro and in adult mouse brain neurons in vivo. Label-free quantification-based proteomic analysis of the BIN1iso1-TID biotinylated proteins led to the discovery of 361 proteins in N2a cells and 897 proteins in mouse brain neurons, identified as BIN1iso1-associated (proximal) or interacting proteins. A total of 92 proteins were common in both datasets, indicating that these are high-confidence BIN1-interacting or proximity proteins. SynapticGO analysis of the mouse brain dataset revealed that BIN1iso1-TurboID labeled 159 synaptic proteins, with 60 corresponding to the synaptic vesicle cycle. Based on phosphorylation site analysis of the neuronal BIN1iso1-TID interactome and related kinase prediction, we selected AAK1, CDK16, SYNJ1, PP2BA, and RANG for validation through immunostaining and proximity ligation assays as members of the BIN1 interactome in the mouse brain. By identifying several previously unknown proximal and potential interacting proteins of BIN1, this study establishes a foundation for further investigations into the function of neuronal BIN1.

                Objective. Closed-loop neurostimulation (CLNS) during slow-wave sleep (SWS) has been shown to enhance slow-wave activity, predominantly using laboratory equipment. To further advance CLNS research and its potential applications, there is a need for user-friendly EEG wearable equipment featuring CLNS that can support long-term CLNS studies in both clinical and home settings. Approach. Here we evaluate whether modeling-based CLNS (M-CLNS) with acoustic stimulation of slow oscillations (SOs) can be effectively implemented using a self-applicable EEG headband with forehead electrodes. We assess the performance of M-CLNS stimulus targeting over the EEG headband together with short-term, stimulus-locked, and more enduring enhancement of SWS. We validate our results against simultaneous recordings obtained using gold-standard laboratory PSG equipment. Main results. Our findings demonstrate that the SO phase can be reliably assessed and accurately targeted using M-CLNS with the EEG headband. We show an immediate enhancement of SO dynamics in the short-term, as well as an enduring increase in power spectral density across SO and delta frequencies (0.75 - 5 Hz) across SWS. These results are in line with previous studies using M-CLNS with laboratory equipment. Significance. These findings demonstrate that M-CLNS with acoustic stimulation can successfully be applied using an EEG headband on the forehead to target SOs, leading to both immediate and enduring enhancements of SWS. In conclusion, M-CLNS in a self-applicable EEG headband may offer a promising tool for portable and non-invasive enhancement of SWS, with future potential for clinical and home-based applications.

">Application of machine learning to discriminate photoreceptor cell species in xenotransplanted chimeric retinas</a></h4>

              
                Photoreceptor transplantation is being studied to improve visual function in retinal diseases causing blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration, hereditary eye diseases, and traumatic retinopathy, among others. Preclinical studies often involve the delivery of exogenous human photoreceptor cells into the retinas of animal models. In such experiments, a key readout is the differential frequency of donor cell somatic integration versus artificial labeling secondary to material transfer of cytosolic or nuclear labels from donor to recipient cells. For this analysis, the ability to recognize photoreceptor nuclei as being of donor (human) versus animal is key, but purely immunohistology discrimination can be challenging because of antigenic species overlap or intercellular antigen transfer. To address this challenge, we sought to develop and validate a computational technique to discriminate between photoreceptor cells of different animal species based on machine learning of nuclear morphology. Here, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using computer-assisted detection of separate nuclei and employing random forest classification to automate the species differentiation, among DAPI-stained photoreceptors after xeno-transplantation of human photoreceptors into the retinas of mice and pigs. Our models were trained on single-species samples and validated with mixed-species samples. We then transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoid cells into rodent and pig retinal degeneration models. The random forest model accurately determined cell identity post-xenotransplantation, validated by histological assessment using an anti-human nuclear antibody. Our results support the potential efficacy of employing machine learning image analysis and classification techniques that may promote experimental rigor, minimize observer bias, and enable high throughput semi-automated workflows for transplantation outcomes analysis. The methodological framework reported here may enable a more nuanced and precise analysis of the behavior of transplanted photoreceptors for the purposes of human retinal regeneration.

                Age-associated vascular alterations make the brain more vulnerable to neuropathologies. Research in humans and rodents have demonstrated structural, molecular, and functional alterations of the aged brain vasculature that suggest blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. However, these studies focused on particular features of the BBB and specific brain regions. Thus, it remains unclear if and which BBB age-associated phenotypes are conserved across brain areas. Moreover, there is very limited information about how BBB dysfunction and cell-specific phenotypes relate to each other. In this manuscript, we use immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and permeability assays to assess how age-associated BBB molecular, structural, and functional phenotypes correlate between the BBB cell types at three brain regions (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum) during mouse early ageing. We discovered that at 18-20 months of age, the mouse prefrontal cortex BBB is the most affected region, with alterations in brain endothelial cell protein expression, BBB permeability, basement membrane thickness, and astrocyte endfoot size when compared to young mice. Here, we deliver a detailed multicellular characterisation of region-dependent BBB changes at early stages of ageing. Our data paves the way for future studies to investigate how region-specific BBB dysfunction may contribute to disease-associated regional vulnerability.

">The effect of virtual reality modality level of immersion and locomotion on spatial learning and gaze measures</a></h4>

              
                The widespread adoption of head-mounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) systems has emerged in various fields, including spatial learning research. This study investigated the effects of VR modality level of immersion, locomotion interface, and proprioception on spatial learning and physiological measures using eye-tracking (ET) in VR. We translated the classic T-maze task from Barnes et al. (1980) to humans for the first time, comparing three VR modalities: 3D HMD VR with physical walking, 3D HMD VR with controller-based movement, and 2D desktop VR. Results revealed that human participants employed a mixture of cue, place, and response strategies when navigating the virtual T-maze, mirroring rodent behavior. In both samples, no significant differences were found between the two HMD VR conditions in learning performance, nor consistent ones in strategy choices. However, 2D desktop navigation was associated with slower initial learning, though this discrepancy diminished in subsequent sessions. These results were supported by spatial presence, immersion, and naturalness reports. Gaze measures showed that participants who physically walked devoted more visual attention to environmental cues compared to controller users. Predictive models for identifying spatial learning strategies based on ET and behavioral measures demonstrated significant accuracy in some models, particularly in the VR walking condition and second session. Our findings enhance the understanding of spatial learning strategies and the effects of VR modality on cognition and gaze behavior. This work demonstrates the potential of integrated ET data and holds implications for early detection and personalized rehabilitation of neurodegenerative conditions related to spatial cognition.

">Transcriptomic Analysis of CAD Cell Differentiation</a></h4>

              
                CAD cells were derived from Cath.a cells, a mouse central nervous system catecholaminergic cell line. Serum-starved CAD cells undergo morphological changes and resemble isolated neurons when observed by microscopy. We carried out an RNAseq transcriptomic analysis to examine differentiated CAD cells for expression signatures related to neuronal functions, identifying ~1900 transcripts whose expression changed with differentiation. Pathview analysis identified ~80 KEGG pathway gene sets that were differentially expressed, including upregulation of at least 13 neuron-related pathways. This dataset can be explored more deeply, allowing further investigation into expression changes relevant to studying neuronal functions in this easy-to-culture model system.

">Modulation of microRNA-502-3p significantly influences synaptic activity, dendritic spine density and mitochondrial morphology in the mice brain</a></h4>

              
                Synapse dysfunction is the root cause of Alzheimers disease (AD). Uninterrupted and regulated synapse action is crucial to maintain healthy brain function. Our previous study discovered microRNA-502-3p (miR-502-3p), a synapse-specific miRNA, highly expressed at the AD synapses. Further, in vitro studies unveiled the biological relevance of miR-502-3p in modulating GABA receptor function, synaptic activity and mitochondrial morphology. Current study focuses to investigate the role of miR-502-3p in vivo using stereotaxic injection of miR-502-3p overexpression (OE) and suppression (sponge) lentivirus (LV) into the hippocampus of C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. MiR-502-3p OE and sponge LV were characterized by transducing HT22 cells followed by QRT-PCR and miRNAScope analysis of miR-502-3p. MiR-502-3p OE LV showed a very high-fold upregulation and sponge LV showed significant reduction in miR-502-3p levels. MiR-502-3p OE and sponge LV were injected into three months old WT mice brain hippocampus. Overexpression and suppression effects of miR-502-3p were studied on synaptic proteins, synapse number, mitochondrial morphology and dendritic spine density at eight-weeks post-injection. Mice injected with miR-502-3p OE LV showed reduced levels of synaptic proteins, diminished synapse formation, defective mitochondrial morphology and reduced dendritic spine density relative to control LV treated mice. While mice treated with sponge LV showed elevated levels of synaptic proteins, augmented synapses, improved mitochondrial morphology and elongated dendrites and spine density. Our in vivo study unveiled translational abilities of miR-502-3p to restore synapse dysfunction in AD and other neurological disorders.

">Illusions of Alignment Between Large Language Models and Brains Emerge From Fragile Methods and Overlooked Confounds</a></h4>

              
                Emerging research seeks to draw neuroscientific insights from the neural predictivity of large language models (LLMs). However, as results continue to be generated at a rapid pace, there is a growing need for large-scale assessments of their robustness. Here, we analyze a wide range of models, methodological approaches, and neural datasets. We find that some methodological approaches, particularly the use of shuffled train-test splits, have led to many impactful yet unreliable findings, and that the method by which activations are extracted from LLMs can bias results to favor particular model classes. Moreover, we find that confounding variables, particularly positional signals and word rate, perform competitively with trained LLMs and fully account for the neural predictivity of untrained LLMs. In summary, our results suggest that theoretically interesting connections between LLMs and brains on three neural datasets are driven largely by fragile methodologies and overlooked confounds.

">Maternal separation disrupts noradrenergic control of adult coping behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) in humans and preclinical rodent models profoundly impacts the brain and correlates with negative affective behaviors in adulthood. The locus coeruleus (LC), a stress-responsive brainstem nucleus that supplies most of the brain with norepinephrine (NE), is known to modulate negative affect. Here we used repeated maternal separation stress (MSS) to investigate the impact of ELS on the LC and stress-related behaviors in adulthood. Using ex vivo cell-attached electrophysiology, we recorded spontaneous LC firing across the lifespan from early development, pre-adolescence, adolescence, through adulthood. MSS significantly increased LC firing during early development and adulthood compared to No MSS mice. We next examined potential changes in the expression of genes linked to LC function. MSS decreased mRNA levels for both the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, the enzyme necessary for NE synthesis. At the behavioral level, MSS increased locomotion in approach-avoidance exploratory assays and increased immobility in the forced swim test. Forced swim increased LC cFos expression, a marker for neuronal excitation, in both No MSS and MSS mice. However, MSS mice had significantly less cFos than No MSS controls. We then sought to reverse this MSS-induced increase in immobility by inhibiting the LC during the forced swim test. In No MSS mice, LC inhibition increased immobility time, however, LC inhibition did not affect MSS immobility. Together, this study demonstrates that MSS dysregulates LC-NE activity across the lifespan and disrupts the role of the LC in regulating coping strategies during stressful events.

">Forward masking in the Inferior Colliculus: Dynamics of Discharge-rate Recovery after Narrowband Noise Maskers</a></h4>

              
                In forward masking the detection threshold for a target sound (probe) is elevated due to the presence of a preceding sound (masker). Although many factors are known to influence the probe response following a masker, the current work focused on the temporal separation (delay) between the masker and probe and the inter-trial interval (ITI). Human probe thresholds recover from forward masking within 150 to 300 ms, similar to neural threshold recovery in the IC within 300 ms after tone maskers. Our study focused on recovery of discharge rate of IC neurons in response to probe tones after narrowband gaussian noise (GN) forward maskers, with varying time delays. Additionally, we examined how prior masker trials influenced IC rates by varying ITI. Our findings showed that previous masker trials impacted probe-evoked discharge rates, with full recovery requiring ITIs over 1.5 s after 70 dB SPL narrowband GN maskers. Neural thresholds in the IC for probes preceded by noise maskers were in the range observed in psychoacoustical studies. Two proposed mechanisms for forward masking, persistence and efferent gain control, were tested using rate analyses or computational modeling. A physiological model with efferent feedback gain control had responses consistent with trends in the physiological recordings.

">Attractor-based models for sequences and pattern generation in neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits in the brain perform a variety of essential functions, including input classification, pattern completion, and the generation of rhythms and oscillations that support functions such as breathing and locomotion. There is also substantial evidence that the brain encodes memories and processes information via sequences of neural activity. Traditionally, rhythmic activity and pattern generation have been modeled using coupled oscillators, whereas input classification and pattern completion have been modeled using attractor neural networks. Here, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates how attractor-based networks can also generate diverse rhythmic patterns, such as those of central pattern generators (CPGs). Additionally, we propose a mechanism for transitioning between patterns. Specifically, we construct a network that can step through a sequence of five different quadruped gaits. It is composed of two dynamically different networks: a ``counter'' network that can count the number of external inputs it receives, encoded via a sequence of fixed points; and a locomotion network that encodes five different quadruped gaits as limit cycles. A sequence of locomotive gaits is obtained by connecting the sequence of fixed points in the counter network with the dynamic attractors of the locomotion network. To accomplish this, we introduce a new architecture for layering networks that produces ``fusion'' attractors, minimizing interference between the attractors of individual layers. All of this is accomplished within a unified framework of attractor-based models using threshold-linear networks.

">Visual adaptation stronger at horizontal than vertical meridian: Linking performance with V1 cortical surface area</a></h4>

              
                Visual adaptation, a mechanism that conserves bioenergetic resources by reducing energy expenditure on repetitive stimuli, leads to decreased sensitivity for similar features (e.g., orientation and spatial frequency). In human adults, visual performance declines with eccentricity and varies around polar angle for many visual dimensions and tasks: Performance is superior along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA)(Carrasco et al., 2001). However, it remains unknown whether visual adaptation differs around polar angle. In this study, we investigated adaptation effects at the fovea and perifovea across the four cardinal locations, for horizontal and vertical adaptor and target orientations, with stimulus size adjusted as per a cortical magnification factor (Rovamo & Virsu, 1979). We measured contrast thresholds at each location separately for adaptation and non-adaptation conditions. Results confirmed the expected HVA and VMA effects in non-adapted conditions and showed they are stronger for horizontal than vertical orientations. They also revealed that, for both orientations, adaptation effects are stronger along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, which in turn is stronger than at the fovea. Furthermore, for both orientations, individual's adaptation effects at the perifoveal locations positively correlated with their cortical surface area of V1. The association of a stronger adaptation effect with larger V1 surface area suggests a more pronounced conservation of bioenergetic resources along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Visual adaptation alleviates the HVA in contrast sensitivity, promoting a more homogeneous perception around the visual field.

">Engineering Cortical Networks: An Open Platform for Controlled Human Circuit Formation and Synaptic Analysis In vitro</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal circuits are complex networks formed by specific neuron connections across brain regions. Understanding their development is key to studying circuit-related dysfunctions in brain diseases. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models aid in this research but lack precise architecture, limiting insights into neuronal interactions and activity-dependent processes. Microfluidic technologies offer structural control but are restricted by closed systems that hinder 3D integration, scalability, and cell retrieval. To address these limitations, we developed an open cortical network platform integrating iPSC-derived cortical neurons with bioengineering techniques. Using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microgroove topography and a cell plating guide, we created neuronal nodes for controlled circuit assembly. This design enables large-scale functional cortical circuits without physical barriers, allowing optogenetic control of neural activity and flexible network modifications, including cellular composition, neurite directionality, and synapse formation. The open design facilitates neuronal material accessibility, supporting multi-level analyses such as proteomics. This platform serves as a powerful tool for investigating neuronal network development and function, offering new opportunities to study both normal and pathological states, including molecular changes linked to connectivity loss in brain diseases.

">Prediction of individual melodic contour processing in sensory association cortices from resting state functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that it is possible to predict an individual brain's spatial activation pattern in response to a paradigm from their functional connectivity at rest (rsFC). However, it is unclear whether this prediction works across the brain. We here aim to understand whether individual task activation can be best predicted in local regions that are highly specialised to the task at hand or whether there are domain-independent regions in the brain that carry most information about the individual. To answer this question, we used fMRI data from participants (nonmusicians, N=52) at rest and during an auditory oddball paradigm while watching a silent movie. We then predicted individual differences in brain responses to melodic deviants from their rsFC both across the whole brain (global parcellation in 22 regions) and within the auditory cortices (local parcellation in 22 regions). Predictability was consistently higher in specific brain areas. These areas are centred around sensory association cortices: In the local (auditory cortex) parcellation, the best predicted area is the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), an auditory association area. The right STG is a critical region in melodic contour processing, a capacity that is central to the paradigm at hand. Interestingly, the best predicted network in the global parcellation is the bilateral visual association cortex. Sensory association cortices may carry more information specific to an individual regardless of the particular paradigm. Our results indicate that individual differences can be predicted in paradigm-relevant areas or general areas with higher inter-individual variability.

">Seed structure and phosphorylation in the fuzzy coat impact tau seeding competency</a></h4>

              
                Tau is a pathogenic protein in Alzheimer's (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The misfolding of tau into beta-sheet rich elongated filaments is thought to be a key event in disease pathogenesis, followed by subsequent templated recruitment of monomeric tau into this pathogenic form. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that specific tau conformations characterize different diseases. In this study, we explored how tau filament core structure and post-translational modifications in its disordered fuzzy coat influence its seeding capacity in primary neurons and mice. We show that the structure of the seeds affects seeding capacity, but that the AD tau core structure alone is insufficient to capture the full seeding capacity of AD tau. Proteolytic cleavage of AD tau which removes the fuzzy coat causes a loss in seeding capacity, as does removal of phosphorylation from the fuzzy coat by phosphatase treatment. Re-phosphorylation of phosphatase-treated AD tau by kinase treatment partially restores seeding activity. Finally, we find that filaments of recombinant tau with twelve phospho-mimetic residues (PAD12 tau) with the AD fold are able to recapitulate the seeding capacity of AD tau. Combined, these results suggest that the structure of the ordered core, together with phosphorylation in the fuzzy coat, confers the seeding capacity of tau filaments.

">Neuronal activity and amyloid-beta cause tau seeding in the entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex is the earliest site of tau pathology in both Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy, yet the mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. Here, we use a computational model integrating neuronal activity and amyloid-beta deposition with interneuronal tau transport to predict regional susceptibility to tau seeding. Using fluorodeoxyglucose PET as a measure of neuronal activity, we show that brain-wide activity patterns drive tau accumulation in the medial temporal lobe, independent of amyloid status. Incorporating amyloid PET, we further show that amyloid-beta selectively amplifies tau seeding in the entorhinal cortex, aligning with its early involvement in Alzheimer's disease. These predictions are supported by cross-subject correlation analysis, which reveals a significant association between model-derived seeding concentrations and empirical tau deposition. Our findings suggest that neuronal activity patterns shape the early landscape of tau pathology, while amyloid-beta deposition creates a unique vulnerability in the entorhinal cortex, potentially triggering the pathological cascade that defines Alzheimer's disease.

">Mechanisms of Tone-in-Noise Encoding in the Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular single-unit responses to tone-in-noise (TIN) stimuli were recorded in the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake female Dutch-belted rabbits. Stimuli consisted of wideband and narrowband tone-in-noise (TIN) with on-and off-characteristic frequency tones. Neural responses to wideband TIN showed a pattern of rates that increased when the tone matched CF and decreased (with respect to noise-alone responses) when the tone was above or below CF. This result differed from narrowband TIN IC responses that depended on envelope fluctuations in the stimulus, consistent with neural-fluctuation sensitivity. The WB-TIN responses could be fit with a difference-of-gaussians model that had narrow excitation and broad inhibition; responses to TIN could not be predicted by response-maps or spectrotemporal receptive fields. Responses to diotic and contralateral presentations of WB-TIN did not differ due to presentation ear. A single-CF computational model of the IC could not predict responses to wideband TIN. However, adding local off-CF inhibitory inputs to an on-CF IC model improved accuracy. These results suggest that broad inhibition could explain encoding of wideband TIN at suprathreshold signal-to-noise ratios, whereas neural fluctuation sensitivity is more important for narrowband sounds.

">Intermittent movement control emerges from information-based planning</a></h4>

              
                Dominant models of reactive motion control in humans, based on optimal feedback control, predict smooth trajectories that reflect averaged behaviors. However, the observation of individual movements suggests that mammalian motor control is inherently discrete, with movement corrections occurring at a rate that depends on task demands and sensory information quality. To address these limitations, we introduce the Information Predictive Control (IPC) framework that integrates model predictive control with information theory, which triggers movement corrections only when unexpected deviations occur and corrections are likely to succeed. By quantifying "surprise" relative to anticipated internal and external states, IPC produces successful movements while robustly responding to sensorimotor noise, task constraints, and target variability. Simulations demonstrate IPC's ability to reproduce human-like responses to novel force fields during reaching, continuous target tracking, and adaptive planning under noise, while dynamically adjusting the planning horizon in complex, unpredictable environments.

">Dynamic Causal Tractography Analysis of Auditory Descriptive Naming:An Intracranial Study of 106 Patients</a></h4>

              
                Humans understand and respond to spoken questions through coordinated activity across distributed cortical networks. However, the causal roles of connectivity engagements alternating across multiple white matter bundles remain understudied at the whole-brain scale. Using intracranial high-gamma activity recorded from 7,792 non-epileptic electrode sites in 106 epilepsy patients who underwent direct cortical stimulation mapping, we constructed an atlas visualizing the millisecond-scale dynamics of functional connectivity during a naming task in response to auditory questions. This atlas, the Dynamic Causal Tractography Atlas, identified functional connectivity patterns at specific time windows most strongly associated with stimulation-induced language- and speech-related manifestations (p-value range: 2.5 x 10-5 to 6.6 x 10-14; rho range: +0.54 to +0.82). The atlas revealed that no single intra-hemispheric fasciculus was consistently engaged in all naming stages; instead, each fasciculus supported specific stages, with multiple distinct major fasciculi simultaneously contributing to each stage. Additionally, this atlas identified the specific linguistic stages and fasciculi where handedness effects became evident. Our findings clarify the dynamics and causal roles of alternating, coordinated neural activity through specific fasciculi during auditory descriptive naming, advancing current neurobiological models of speech network organization. Additionally, we have made our white matter streamline template and intracranial EEG data available as open-source material, enabling investigators to construct personalized dynamic tractography atlases.

">Assigning Targetable Molecular Pathways to Transdiagnostic Subgroups Across Autism and Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Significant genetic, behavioural and neuroanatomic heterogeneity is common in autism spectrum- and related- neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). This heterogeneity constrains the development of effective therapies for diverse patients in precision medicine paradigms. This has led to the search for subgroups of individuals having common etiologic factors/biology (e.g., genetic pathways), thus creating potential uniformity in prognosis and/or treatment response. Despite NDDs having a strong genetic component, only ~15-20% of individuals will present with a specific rare genetic variant considered clinically pathogenic, and therefore, subtyping efforts tend to focus on using clinical, cognitive, and/or brain imaging phenotypes to group individuals. Here we delineated mechanisms via mouse to human translational neuroscience. Using MRI derived structural neuroanatomy and a spatial transcriptomic comparison, we linked subgroups of 135 NDD relevant mouse models (3,515 individual mice) separately to two human databases, with 1,234 and 1,015 human individuals with NDDs, composed of autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), other related NDDs, and typically developing controls. Subgroups were significantly linked by consistent neuroanatomy across all three datasets, mouse and human, indicating that direct cross-species subgrouping and translation is consistent and reproducible. Ultimately, four specific neuroanatomical clusters were found and linked to precise molecular mechanisms: two showing a chromatin/transcription motif, with one of those showing specific links to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and Notch signalling, and another two being mainly synaptic in origin, with one off those showing specific connections to axon guidance and Wnt signaling. Assigning molecular pathways, and thus genetic information, from the mouse to individual participants provides an insight into undetected and/or related genetic variants that could be working in combination or interacting with an environmental influence. Moreover, the subgroups found are transdiagnostic, including participants with autism, ADHD, and OCD, which indicates that NDDs as a whole can be subdivided into consistent neuroanatomical clusters with cohesive underlying biological mechanisms. This work allows us to bridge the gap between preclinical models and human disorders, linking previously idiopathic human patients to pertinent genetics, molecular mechanisms, and pathways.

">Global brain maintenance predicts well-preserved cognitive function: A pooled analysis of three longitudinal population-based Swedish cohorts</a></h4>

              
                Substantial heterogeneity in cognitive ageing is well documented. Such heterogeneity has been attributed to individual differences in brain maintenance - i.e., the relative preservation of neural resources in ageing. However, large-scale longitudinal evidence is lacking. We pooled data from three population-based Swedish cohorts (Betula, N = 196; SNAC-K, N = 472; H70, N = 688; aged 60-93 years at baseline, follow-up duration up to 7 years) to assess whether global brain maintenance is associated with better preserved cognition in ageing, and to identify lifestyle predictors of brain maintenance. In each cohort, global brain integrity was indexed by the volume of the lateral ventricles (adjusted for total intracranial volume), and general cognitive function based on a principal component analysis of four age-sensitive cognitive domains. Participants were classified into subgroups of low (i.e., 'aged') versus high (i.e., 'youth-like') brain integrity based on ventricular volume estimates available for a younger reference sample in one of the cohorts (Betula, 25-55 years, N = 60). Subgroup differences in cognition at baseline and over the follow-up were assessed with ANCOVAs and linear mixed effects models. Logistic regressions were used to examine lifestyle predictors of brain maintenance. Across cohorts, 881 individuals (64.97%) were classified into the high brain integrity subgroup at baseline and 409 individuals (49.82%) over the follow-up. Maintenance of more youth-like brain integrity was associated with better baseline cognition (p < .001) and less cognitive decline longitudinally (p < .001). Moreover, lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and the absence of diabetes predicted brain maintenance at baseline (CVD risk, OR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.68, 0.93]; diabetes, OR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.26, 0.59]) and over the follow-up (CVD risk, OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.64, 0.96]; diabetes, OR = 0.53, 95% CI [0.29, 0.94]). These findings underscore brain maintenance as a key determinant of cognitive ageing and highlight the importance of managing cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk factors for promotion of brain and cognitive health in later life.

">Transformations of the spatial activity manifold convey aversive information in CA3</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal circuits form cognitive maps representing spatial position and integrating contextual information, including affective cues, within episodic memory representations. We investigated how spatial and affective information combine in the population activity of CA3 axons by imaging intermediate-to-dorsal and dorsal-to-dorsal projections in mice navigating a linear track before, during, and after exposure to an aversive air puff stimulus. Our analyses reveal that both axonal populations maintain a robust, time-invariant spatial coding manifold across recordings, independent of affective context. Alterations to this common manifold encode the presence of the aversive stimulus without disrupting the spatial representation. Both axonal pathways encoded affective information with similar efficacy. This population-level encoding was distributed similarly across place and non-place cells. Our findings demonstrate that hippocampal CA3 axons integrate spatial and affective information within a common representational geometry while preserving the ability to extract each information type separately.

	<p>Background: Numerous individuals suffer from attentional issues, such as ADHD. While medication is considered the first-line treatment, it is unavailable to some. As a result, certain individuals are choosing to self-medicate with novel stimulants, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. We aimed to investigate which NPSs are being used to self-medicate ADHD, evaluate their perceived effectiveness, and explore the experiences and motivations of those self-medicating. Methods: Data from respondents (n = 225) (mean age [SD] = 29.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.6; male = 83%; female = 12%; non-binary = 5%) were collected via an online survey, with nine participants (mean age = 31.4; male = 5; female = 1; non-binary = 3) undertaking further semi-structured interviews and the data being investigated using a framework analysis. Results: The most-used NPSs were 4F-MPH and 2-FMA. Some individuals perceived self-medication to be more effective than conventional treatment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). A framework analysis identified the following themes surrounding novel stimulant self-medication: (1) the use of NPS stimulants as a stopgap between treatments; (2) poor access to ADHD treatment; (3) a lack of openness and confidence in psychiatrists and healthcare providers. Conclusion: Novel stimulants are being used when access to ADHD treatment is poor. Interventions should aim to reduce long treatment wait times and issues surrounding geographical access. Careful consideration should be given before denying stimulant medication to individuals with co-occurring substance use and psychiatric comorbidity. Individuals desire a more patient-centred ADHD treatment with broader pharmacotherapies.</p>

Methods and Results: Retinal cultures obtained from 8-day-old (E8) chick embryos and maintained for 12&amp;amp;ndash;15 days (C12&amp;amp;ndash;15) were used. MTT assays revealed that the CB1/CB2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) decreased cell viability in the cultures in a time-dependent manner, with a concomitant increase in extracellular LDH activity, suggesting membrane integrity loss. Cell death was also dose-dependently induced by cannabidiol (CBD), &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and CP55940, another CB1/CB2 agonist. In contrast to WIN-induced cell death that was not blocked by either antagonist, the deleterious effect of CBD was blocked by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528, but not by PF514273, a CB1 receptor antagonist. WIN-treated cultures showed glial cells with large vacuoles in cytoplasm that were absent in cultures incubated with WIN plus 4-phenyl-butyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone. Since cannabinoids induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alfa (eIF2&amp;amp;alpha;), these results suggest a process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling and stress. Incubation of the cultures with WIN for 4 h induced a ~five-fold increase in the number of cells labeled with the ROS indicator CM-H2DCFDA. WIN induced the phosphorylation of JNK but not of p38 in the cultures, and also induced an increase in the number of glial cells expressing cleaved-caspase 3 (c-CASP3). The decrease in cell viability and the expression of c-CASP3 was blocked by salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2&amp;amp;alpha; dephosphorylation. Conclusions: These data suggest that cannabinoids induce the apoptosis of glial cells in culture by promoting ROS production, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation, and caspase-3 processing.

	<p>Background: Middle-aged and elderly individuals may experience detrimental health effects due to ischemic stroke (IS). The inflammatory response triggered during IS exacerbates neuronal damage, becoming a barrier to effective IS treatment and leading to poor patient prognosis. Nevertheless, the specific role of microglia in the inflammatory response triggered by IS remains mostly unclear. The primary target of this investigation is to study the neuroinflammatory impact of lycorine (LYC) during the IS process. Our objective is to evaluate whether LYC deploys its anti-inflammatory effect with modulation of the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway, thereby reducing IS symptoms. Methods: In this research, BV-2 cells were pre-treated with LYC for 24 h before LPS was added to induce inflammation. Results: It has been discovered that LYC suppresses BV-2 cell polarization and reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), showing its potential anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Furthermore, I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and p65 play crucial roles in regulating the inflammatory response within the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway. Mechanistic exploration indicates that LYC can activate the expression of I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; inhibits NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B by binding to its p65 subunit, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its translocation to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting inflammation. Additionally, p65 is a key transcription factor for pro-inflammatory genes, and its downregulation leads to decreased transcriptional activity of these genes. The combined effect of increased I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and decreased p65 results in significantly reduced NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B activity, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response. Meanwhile, in vivo studies indicate that LYC pre-treatment significantly reduces the infarct size caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The assessment of cerebral infarction volume, neurological scores, brain edema rate and inflammation levels in MCAO rats pre-treated with LYC indicates positive therapeutic effects. Conclusions: In summary, our research indicates that LYC pre-treatment has significant anti-inflammatory effects by attenuating inflammation levels through NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B inhibition, which contributes to potential therapeutic benefits in ischemic stroke (IS) and may improve disease prognosis. LYC may serve as an adjunctive clinical pre-treatment for IS, which has to be confirmed by clinical trials in the future.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In many societies, especially in highly masculine societies like Japan, being a man, getting older, engaging in knowledge work, and earning a high annual salary are seen as conditions for success. On the other hand, an increasing number of studies have shown that incorporating kawaii-ness into our lives can help maintain and improve happiness and well-being. Methods: Therefore, in this study, we employed a variable expressing the response to kawaii-ness together with four demographic variables (sex, age, income, and knowledge work), happiness, and fractional anisotropy brain healthcare quotient (FA-BHQ) which is derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images calculations to analyze the relationship between them. Results: The results of a path analysis using data obtained from 182 healthy men and women showed that kawaii-ness mediates the association between demographic variables and happiness, which is in turn associated with FA-BHQ. Furthermore, with the correlation analysis between happiness and individual FA regions, we were able to confirm that FA regions, including the limbic-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is responsible for emotional regulation, are related to happiness. Conclusions: These results indicate the following: Men, older people, people engaged in knowledge work, and people with high annual incomes avoid kawaii-ness; As a result, they are unable to obtain the sense of happiness that they should have; as a result, they are unable to keep their brains healthy, and their brain functions, including emotional regulation, are not functioning properly; This may prevent them from maintaining or improving their performance. This study is the first attempt to clarify the relationship between demographic scales, kawaii-ness, happiness, and brain conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27087?af=R">Congenital Titinopathy: Comprehensive Characterization of the Most Severe End of the Disease Spectrum</a></h4>

              
                <p>Congenital titinopathy has recently emerged as one of the most common congenital muscle disorders.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To better understand the presentation and clinical needs of the under-characterized extreme end of the congenital titinopathy severity spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We comprehensively analyzed the clinical, imaging, pathology, autopsy, and genetic findings in 15 severely affected individuals from 11 families.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prenatal features included hypokinesia or akinesia and growth restriction. Six pregnancies were terminated. Nine infants were born at or near term with severe-to-profound weakness and required resuscitation. Seven died following withdrawal of life support. Two surviving children require ongoing respiratory support. Most cohort members had at least 1 disease-causing variant predicted to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. The exceptions, from 2 unrelated families, had homozygous truncating variants predicted to induce complete nonsense mediated decay. However, subsequent analyses suggested that the causative variant in each family had an additional previously unrecognized impact on splicing likely to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. This impact was confirmed by minigene assay for 1 variant.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study confirms the clinical variability of congenital titinopathy. Severely affected individuals succumb prenatally/during infancy, whereas others survive into adulthood. It is likely that this variability is because of differences in the amount and/or length of expressed titin. If confirmed, analysis of titin expression could facilitate clinical prediction and increasing expression might be an effective treatment strategy. Our findings also further-support the hypothesis that some near-normal-length titin expression is essential to early prenatal survival. Sometimes expression of normal/near-normal-length titin is due to disease-causing variants having an additional impact on splicing. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:611–628</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic feature involving the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain (tauopathies). This suggests that there may be some shared pathophysiologic mechanism(s). The largest risk factor for the majority of these disorders is aging, suggesting involvement of the aging process in the shared pathophysiology. We test the hypothesis that an increase in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that occurs during aging contributes to the onset and progression of tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were used to investigate the effects of BMP signaling on tau phosphorylation and release and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Wildtype mice were used to examine effects of BMP signaling <i>in vivo</i>. P301S (PS19) mice were examined for the effects of BMP signaling in a model of tauopathy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we show that BMP signaling, mediated by non-canonical p38 signaling, increases tau phosphorylation and release of p-tau in human iPSC-derived AD neurons. Further, there is an interaction between BMP signaling and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) that significantly increases tau phosphorylation and release compared with ApoE3 neurons. Inhibiting BMP signaling reduces the changes in tau in the cultured human neurons, and it limits tau pathology and prevents cognitive decline in PS19 mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that the age-related increase in BMP signaling may participate in the onset and progression of tau pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions that reduce BMP signaling in the aging brain could potentially slow or prevent development of diseases involving tau hyperphosphorylation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days’ gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:673–687</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27151?af=R">Critical Care Decisions After Large Core Cerebral Infarctions: A Secondary Analysis From the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and large ischemic cores, critical decisions often need to be made about decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) or early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). In this study, we aimed to evaluate utilization of DHC and early WLST and factors associated with them in patients with large strokes from the SELECT2 trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed the entire SELECT2 trial population, which randomized 352 patients with stroke due to LVO and large ischemic cores to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or medical management. We used the as-treated principle to compare the use of DHC and early WLST within 7 days after randomization. We further assessed functional outcomes (modified Rankin Score) after these decisions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 352 patients enrolled in this study, 55 received DHC and 81 transitioned to early WLST. Patients treated with EVT were as likely to undergo DHC (16% vs 15%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.19, 95% CI:0.75–1.88, <i>p</i> = 0.46) or WLST (22% vs 24%, aRR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.72) as those given medical management. DHC was used more frequently in younger patients and WLST more in older patients. EVT efficacy was maintained after adjusting for DHC (adjusted generalized odds ratio [aGenOR] = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.24–2.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with no interaction between DHC and treatment (p-interaction = 0.93). At 1 year, 21% of DHC-treated patients were ambulatory; the outcomes were universally poor after early WLST.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the SELECT2 trial of patients with large ischemic core, DHC was performed in ~1 of 6 patients and early WLST in ~1 of 5 patients, without differences based on treatment with EVT or medical management, nor successful reperfusion. DHC or WLST did not detract from thrombectomy treatment benefit. Additionally, ~20% of patients achieved independent ambulation despite receiving DHC by the 1-year follow-up. The similar distribution of these critical care decisions provides reassurance that the overall trial outcomes were not biased by open-label treatment allocation.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a serious neurologic condition associated with death or neurodevelopmental impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for neuroprognostication, but there is substantial subjectivity and uncertainty about neurodevelopmental outcome prediction. We sought to develop an objective and automated approach for the analysis of newborn brain MRI to improve the accuracy of prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We created an anatomic MRI template from a sample of 286 infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and labeled the deep gray-matter structures. We extracted quantitative information, including shape-related information, and information represented by complex patterns (radiomic measures), from each of these structures in all infants. We then trained an elastic net model to use either only these measures, only the infants’ demographic and laboratory data, or both, to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes, as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 18 months of age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those infants for whom Bayley scores were available for cognitive, language, and motor outcomes, we found sets of MRI-based measures that could predict their Bayley scores with correlations that were greater than the correlations based on only the demographic and laboratory data, explained more of the variance in the observed scores, and generated a smaller error; predictions based on the combination of the demographic-laboratory and MRI-based measures were similar or marginally better.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings show that machine learning models using MRI-based measures can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy across all neurodevelopmental domains and across the full spectrum of outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:791–802</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27156?af=R">Association that Neuroimaging and Clinical Measures Have with Change in Arm Impairment in a Phase 3 Stroke Recovery Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation therapy improved motor status compared to rehabilitation alone in the phase III VNS-REHAB stroke trial, but treatment response was variable and not associated with any clinical measures acquired at baseline, such as age or side of paresis. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures would be associated with treatment-related gains, examining performance of regional injury measures versus global brain health measures in parallel with clinical measures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the VNS-REHAB trial were used to derive regional injury measures (extent of injury to corticospinal tract, the primary regional measure; plus extent of injury to precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; lesion volume; and lesion topography) and global brain health measures (degree of white matter hyperintensities, the primary global brain measure; plus volumes of cerebrospinal fluid, cortical gray matter, white matter, each thalamus, and total brain). Eight clinical measures assessed at baseline were also evaluated (treatment group, age, race, gender, paretic side, pre-stroke dominant hand, time since stroke, and baseline Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score). Bivariate analyses compared each measure with the primary trial end point (change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score from baseline to end of 6 weeks of treatment) across all subjects, with secondary analyses examining trial groups separately.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRIs were available from 80 patients (age = 59.8 ± 9.5 years, 29 women). Across all patients, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.028) at baseline was associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. In the VNS group, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and larger ipsilesional thalamus volume (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were each associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses tested the interaction that each baseline measure had with treatment group and found that the model examining white matter hyperintensities had a significant interaction term, indicating 2.3 less change in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) points in the VNS group relative to the control group for each point increase in modified Fazekas scale.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging measures are associated with extent of gains on the primary endpoint of a phase III stroke recovery trial. Among the neuroimaging measures examined, a measure of global brain health (extent of white matter hyperintensities) was better at explaining the change in arm impairment as compared with measures of regional injury; this was true when examining all study subjects as well as only those in the VNS group and is consistent with the global mechanism of action that VNS has throughout the cerebrum. Future studies can evaluate additional measures that further predict response to VNS therapy. The current findings suggest that individual patient neuroimaging results may be useful for a personalized medicine approach to stroke recovery therapeutics.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (<i>r</i> = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.</p>

<p>Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:779–790</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Remote identification of individuals with severe hyposmia may enable scalable recruitment of participants with underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation. We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2 = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2 = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2 = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:741–752</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27165?af=R">Increased White Matter Aerobic Glycolysis in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite treatments which reduce relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), many patients continue to experience progressive disability accumulation. MS is associated with metabolic disruptions and cerebral metabolic stress predisposes to tissue injury and possibly impaired remyelination. Additionally, myelin homeostasis is metabolically expensive and reliant on glycolysis. We investigated cerebral metabolic changes in MS and when in the disease course they occurred, and assessed their relationship with microstructural changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study used combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and oxygen, thereby quantifying glycolysis. Twelve healthy controls, 20 patients with relapsing MS, and 13 patients with non-relapsing MS were studied. Relapsing patients with MS were treatment naïve and scanned pre- and post-initiation of high efficacy disease modifying therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In normal appearing white matter, we observed increased glucose utilization and reduced oxygen utilization in newly diagnosed MS, consistent with increased glycolysis. Increased glycolysis was greater in patients with a longer disease duration course and higher disability. Among newly diagnosed patients, different treatments had differential impacts on glucose utilization. Last, whereas hypermetabolism within lesions was clearly associated with inflammation, no such relationship was found within normal appearing white matter.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased white matter glycolysis is a prominent feature of cerebral metabolism in MS. It begins early in the disease course, increases with disease duration and is independent of microstructural evidence of inflammation in normal appearing white matter. Optimization of the metabolic environment may be an important component of therapies designed to reduce progressive disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:766–778</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively evaluated how well combinations of signs and symptoms can identify individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study comprised 6,108 men who underwent repeated assessments of key prodromal features and were prospectively followed for the development of PD. Two composite measures of prodromal PD were evaluated: (i) the co-occurrence of constipation, probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and hyposmia, and (ii) the probability of prodromal PD based on the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria. We also examined the progression and heterogeneity of the prodromal PD phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three individuals were newly diagnosed with PD over an average follow-up of 3.4 years. Men with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had a 23-fold higher risk of receiving a PD diagnosis in the subsequent 3 years, compared with men without these features (risk ratio [RR] = 23.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.62–51.33). The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD ≥ 0.8 compared with those with a probability &lt; 0.2 (RR = 21.96, 95% CI = 11.17–43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability ≥ 0.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrates that combinations of key signs and symptoms strongly predict future clinically manifest PD. These measures may be integrated into screening strategies to identify individuals who could be targeted for enrollment into PD prevention trials. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:720–729</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27167?af=R">Loss of TDP‐43 Splicing Repression Occurs in Myonuclei of Inclusion Body Myositis Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with muscle pathology characterized by endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). We aimed to determine whether loss of TDP-43 splicing repression led to the production of “cryptic peptides” that could be detected in muscle biopsies as a useful biomarker for IBM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an antisera against a neoepitope encoded by a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon within hepatoma-derived growth factor-like protein 2 (<i>HDGFL2</i>) for immunohistochemical analysis on muscle biopsy samples of 122 patients with IBM, 181 disease controls, and 16 healthy controls without abnormal muscle pathology. In situ hybridization was also utilized to detect the localization of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> peptides localized within myonuclei from muscle biopsies in 79 of 122 patients with IBM (65%), and this staining correlated with TDP-43 depletion. In contrast, cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> immunoreactivity was absent in 197 muscle biopsies from a variety of disease controls, except for 2 patients with vacuolar myopathies. Notably, we show that cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts are accompanied by the detection of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> in muscle fibers of IBM without rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 aggregates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together, our findings establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression occurs in myonuclei of IBM skeletal muscle and suggest that detection of cryptic peptides in muscle biopsies may be a useful biomarker. We suggest that a therapeutic strategy designed to restore TDP-43 function should be considered to attenuate the degeneration of skeletal muscle in this devastating disease.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27155?af=R">The Utility of Long‐Read Sequencing in Diagnosing Early Onset Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variants in <i>PRKN</i> and <i>PINK1</i> are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous <i>PRKN</i> or <i>PINK1</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported <i>PRKN</i>/<i>PINK1</i> pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 47 patients were studied (<i>PRKN</i> “one-variant,” n = 23; <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant,” n = 12; <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants,” n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of <i>PRKN</i> “one-variant” patients (6/23), but none in <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant” patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants” group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the <i>PRKN</i> locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:753–765</p>

                Tavano et al. discovered a novel mechanism controlling lateral mesendoderm (LME) migration during zebrafish gastrulation. LME uses the lateral ectoderm as a permissive substrate for its migration. At the animal pole, LME migration is halted due to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling modulating ectoderm tissue properties, rendering it non-permissive for LME migration.

	<p>Background: When engaging with the environment, multisensory cues interact and are integrated to create a coherent representation of the world around us, a process that has been suggested to be affected by the lack of visual feedback in blind individuals. In addition, the presence of voluntary movement can be responsible for suppressing somatosensory information processed by the cortex, which might lead to a worse encoding of tactile information. Objectives: In this work, we aim to explore how cross-modal interaction can be affected by active movements and the role of vision in this process. Methods: To this end, we measured the precision of 18 blind individuals and 18 age-matched sighted controls in a velocity discrimination task. The participants were instructed to detect the faster stimulus between a sequence of two in both passive and active touch conditions. The sensory stimulation could be either just tactile or audio&amp;amp;ndash;tactile, where a non-informative sound co-occurred with the tactile stimulation. The measure of precision was obtained by computing the just noticeable difference (JND) of each participant. Results: The results show worse precision with the audio&amp;amp;ndash;tactile sensory stimulation in the active condition for the sighted group (p = 0.046) but not for the blind one (p = 0.513). For blind participants, only the movement itself had an effect. Conclusions: For sighted individuals, the presence of noise from active touch made them vulnerable to auditory interference. However, the blind group exhibited less sensory interaction, experiencing only the detrimental effect of movement. Our work should be considered when developing next-generation haptic devices.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Suicidal behaviors (SBs) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are significant mental health concerns in children and adolescents. The hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis, of which cortisol is a key hormone, has been implicated in these behaviors. This narrative review aims to explore whether cortisol levels play a role in SBs and NSSI in youth and to synthesize current evidence on this topic. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on studies published through November 2024, using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were screened for eligibility, including only human studies published in English, with no animal models or studies excluding cortisol levels. A narrative synthesis approach was used due to the methodological diversity across studies. Due to limited adolescent-focused research, studies involving adults were also considered. Results: Findings indicate inconsistent cortisol patterns in relation to SBs and NSSI. Elevated cortisol levels are linked to SBs, with some studies suggesting they may predict future suicide attempts, though no definitive cause-and-effect relationship is established. Conversely, cortisol levels in relation to NSSI show mixed results, with some studies reporting no differences. Cortisol responses to stress, measured by saliva, blood, and hair, reveal complex interactions with psychological factors such as depression and impulsivity, influencing cortisol secretion. Discussion: Despite some evidence pointing to a role of cortisol dysregulation in SBs and NSSI, the relationship remains unclear due to study heterogeneity, including small sample sizes and methodological variations. Gender and the type of stressor used in studies also complicate the findings. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, better control for confounding factors, and utilize more diverse cortisol assessment methods to clarify these links. Conclusions: While cortisol may play a role in the pathophysiology of SBs and NSSI, further research is needed to establish clearer, more reliable patterns. Identifying alterations in cortisol levels may aid in early detection and targeted interventions for at-risk adolescents.</p>

                <p>Evolutionary pressures adapted insect chemosensation to their respective physiological needs and tasks in their ecological niches. Solitary nocturnal moths rely on their acute olfactory sense to find mates at night. Pheromones are detected with maximized sensitivity and high temporal resolution through mechanisms that are mostly unknown. While the inverse topology of insect olfactory receptors and heteromerization with the olfactory receptor coreceptor suggest ionotropic transduction via odorant-gated receptor&ndash;ion channel complexes, contradictory data propose amplifying G-protein&ndash;coupled transduction. Here, we used in vivo tip-recordings of pheromone-sensitive sensilla of male <I>Manduca sexta</I> hawkmoths at specific times of day (rest vs activity). Since the olfactory receptor neurons distinguish signal parameters in three consecutive temporal windows of their pheromone response (phasic; tonic; late, long-lasting), respective response parameters were analyzed separately. Disruption of G-protein&ndash;coupled transduction and block of phospholipase C decreased and slowed the phasic response component during the activity phase of hawkmoths without affecting any other component of the response during activity and rest. A more targeted disruption of G<SUB>&alpha;</SUB> subunits by blocking G<SUB>&alpha;o</SUB> or sustained activation of G<SUB>&alpha;s</SUB> using bacterial toxins affected the phasic pheromone response, while toxins targeting G<SUB>&alpha;q</SUB> and G<SUB>&alpha;12/13</SUB> were ineffective. Consistent with these data, the expression of phospholipase C&beta;4 depended on zeitgeber time, which indicates circadian clock-modulated metabotropic pheromone transduction cascades that maximize sensitivity and temporal resolution of pheromone transduction during the hawkmoth's activity phase. Thus, discrepancies in the literature on insect olfaction may be resolved by considering circadian timing and the distinct odor response components.</p>

                <p>Humans and nonhumans alike often make choices to gain information, even when the information cannot be used to change the outcome. Prior research has shown that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for evaluating options involving reward-predictive information. Here we studied the role of ACC in information choices using optical inhibition to evaluate the contribution of this region during specific epochs of decision-making. Rats could choose between an uninformative option followed by a cue that predicted reward 50% of the time versus a fully informative option that signaled outcomes with certainty but was rewarded only 20% of the time. Reward seeking during the informative S+ cue decreased following ACC inhibition, indicating a causal contribution of this region in supporting reward expectation to a cue signaling reward with certainty. Separately in a positive control experiment and in support of a known role for this region in sustaining high-effort behavior for preferred rewards, we observed reduced lever presses and lower breakpoints in effort choices following ACC inhibition. The lack of changes in reward latencies in both types of decisions indicate the motivational value of rewards remained intact, revealing instead a common role for ACC in maintaining persistence toward certain and valuable rewards.</p>

                <p>Vestibular research is essential for understanding and treating disorders such as vertigo and Meniere's disease. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a key method for assessing vestibular function and an essential tool for diagnosing vertigo. Traditionally, the VOR comprises angular VOR (aVOR) and translational VOR (tVOR), which originate from the vestibular semicircular canals (SCCs) and otolith organs, respectively. VOR consists of both fast-phase and slow-phase eye movements, which functionally interact to contribute to gaze control. However, to calculate the gain and phase parameters of the VOR, it is common practice to exclude fast-phase information superimposed on slow-phase eye movements. As a result, the information contained in the fast phase has not been fully utilized. OVAR is primarily used to evaluate otolith function, as there is no SCC input during its steady state. It is widely accepted that fast-phase nystagmus (FPN) during OVAR is generated by periodic otolith inputs via the central vestibular velocity storage mechanism. Surprisingly, we discovered in this study that SCC input can modify the generation of FPN in mouse OVAR test, as demonstrated by testing <I>Zpld1</I> (Zona pellucida-like domain containing 1 protein) mutant mice with SCC deficits. This finding was further confirmed using both unilateral and bilateral semicircular canals dehiscence surgical models. In addition to revealing the dependence of FPN on SCC input, we demonstrated that FPN can be used to evaluate vestibular function, particularly in conditions that are difficult to assess using slow-phase eye movements, such as unilateral vestibular lesions and central modulation via baclofen treatment.</p>

                Abstract Background Recent advancements in online gambling have significantly increased the popularity and participation in gambling activities among the general population, specifically the young generations. These changes are reshaping gambling behaviors, attracting a growing number of enthusiasts. This paper describes a dataset that maps online gambling activities among young individuals in Portugal, providing insights into their gambling prevalence, habits, behaviors, preferences, and potential antecedents and consequences of these activities. Methods A survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,993 young people in Portugal, aged between 18 and 34, to gather data on their activities. This methodology involved a quantitative telephone survey conducted in March and April 2023, utilizing quota sampling to ensure representation across various regions. The data collection process employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and involved rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Conclusion The dataset generated from this survey provides valuable insights into the patterns of online gambling activities among young Portuguese individuals. It allows researchers to explore potential risk factors, including gambling-related harm, and to understand the sociodemographic factors influencing gambling behaviors. The findings can inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of online gambling among youth.

                Background Interest in alternative sources of tubers and legumes has increased due to the search for raw materials with bioactive antioxidant compounds. The objective of this study was to characterize taro (TF) and sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) flours obtained by the wet (SIF-WM) and defatted (SIF-DM) methods, as alternatives for the formulation of functional foods. Methods Proximal tests were conducted to determine basic chemical composition, quantification of free polyphenols, antioxidant activity using the ABTS* radical method (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) with Trolox as a standard, and rheological analyses, including pasting curves, flow profiles, and viscoelastic properties. Microbiological characterization of the flours was also performed. Results The highest protein content was found in sacha inchi flour obtained by the defatted method (72.62%), while carbohydrates were the main component in taro flour (85.4%). In terms of antioxidant activity, taro flour showed higher values of 2.71 µmol ET/g and 7.47 mg EAG/g. Rheological analysis showed that adding taro flour increased the viscosity peak and reduced breakdown, improving gel stability. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. were detected in taro flour. Conclusions Taro and sacha inchi flours have great potential for the development of functional products like protein snacks, with good expansion due to taro starch and are naturally gluten-free, making them suitable for people with celiac disease.

                Appendicularians are planktonic tunicates abundant all over the world. Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1192/v3?src=rss">Conceptualizing university students’ food choices based on theory of planned behavior [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Campus cuisine differs substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study uses the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand university students’ food choices, employing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students in technical and health science programs from a private university in Udupi who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The duration of students’ campus residence provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, there was an absence of nutritional information displayed in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation provides insights into the role of UDF in offering nutritionally balanced meals to students, potentially contributing to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                Background First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions  1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

                Rab1 is a highly conserved small GTPase that exists in humans as two isoforms: Rab1A and Rab1B, sharing 92% sequence identity. These proteins regulate vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and within the Golgi stacks. Rab1A and Rab1B may be oncogenes, as they are frequently dysregulated in various human cancers. Moreover, they contribute to the progression of Parkinson’s disease. The availability of high-quality antibodies specific for Rab1A or Rab1B is essential to understand the distinct functions of these Rab1 proteins in both health and diseaseand to enhance the reproducibility of research involving these proteins. In this study, we characterized seven antibodies targeting Rab1A and five antibodies targeting Rab1B for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a much larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a valuable resource for the scientific community. While uses of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

                <p>by Zhengdong Wang, Yifeixue Yang, Ziyi Huang, Wanyun Zhao, Kaiqiang Su, Hengcheng Zhu, Dazhi Yin</p>

Understanding the large-scale information processing that underlies complex human cognition is the central goal of cognitive neuroscience. While emerging activity flow models demonstrate that cognitive task information is transferred by interregional functional or structural connectivity, graph-theory-based models typically assume that neural communication occurs via the shortest path of brain networks. However, whether the shortest path is the optimal route for empirical cognitive information transmission remains unclear. Based on a large-scale activity flow mapping framework, we found that the performance of activity flow prediction with the shortest path was significantly lower than that with the direct path. The shortest path routing was superior to other network communication strategies, including search information, path ensembles, and navigation. Intriguingly, the shortest path outperformed the direct path in activity flow prediction when the physical distance constraint and asymmetric routing contribution were simultaneously considered. This study not only challenges the shortest path assumption through empirical network models but also suggests that cognitive task information routing is constrained by the spatial and functional embedding of the brain network.

                <p>by Wei-Yu Lin, Melissa Kartawinata, Bethany R. Jebson, Restuadi Restuadi, Hannah Peckham, Anna Radziszewska, Claire Deakin, Coziana Ciurtin, CLUSTER Consortium , Lucy R. Wedderburn, Chris Wallace</p>

Gene expression studies often use bulk RNA sequencing of mixed cell populations because single cell or sorted cell sequencing may be prohibitively expensive. However, mixed cell studies may miss expression patterns that are restricted to specific cell populations. Computational deconvolution can be used to estimate cell fractions from bulk expression data and infer average cell-type expression in a set of samples (e.g., cases or controls), but imputing sample-level cell-type expression is required for more detailed analyses, such as relating expression to quantitative traits, and is less commonly addressed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of imputing sample-level cell-type expression using a real dataset where mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sorted (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19) RNA sequencing data were generated from the same subjects (N=158), and pseudobulk datasets synthesised from eQTLgen single cell RNA-seq data. We compared three domain-specific methods, CIBERSORTx, bMIND and debCAM/swCAM, and two cross-domain machine learning methods, multiple response LASSO and ridge, that had not been used for this task before. We also assessed the methods according to their ability to recover differential gene expression (DGE) results. LASSO/ridge showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity for recovering DGE signals seen in observed data compared to deconvolution methods, although LASSO/ridge had higher area under curves than deconvolution methods. Machine learning methods have the potential to outperform domain-specific methods when suitable training data are available.

Aberrant alternative splicing, prevalent in cancer, impacts various cancer hallmarks involving proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Splicing disruption often results from somatic point mutations rewiring functional pathways to support cancer cell survival. We introduce iSoMAs (iSoform expression and somatic Mutation Association), an efficient computational pipeline leveraging principal component analysis technique, to explore how somatic mutations influence transcriptome-wide gene expression at the isoform level. Applying iSoMAs to 33 cancer types comprising 9,738 tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified 908 somatically mutated genes significantly associated with altered isoform expression across three or more cancer types. Mutations linked to differential isoform expression occurred through both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting mechanisms, involving well-known oncogenes/suppressor genes, RNA binding protein and splicing factor genes. With wet-lab experiments, we verified direct association between <i>TP53</i> mutations and differential isoform expression in cell cycle genes. Additional iSoMAs genes have been validated in the literature with independent cohorts and/or methods. Despite the complexity of cancer, iSoMAs attains computational efficiency via dimension reduction strategy and reveals critical associations between regulatory factors and transcriptional landscapes.

A crucial challenge in neuroscience involves characterising brain dynamics from high-dimensional brain recordings. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change over time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a common theoretical framework and a clear view on the interpretation of the results derived from the dFC matrices. Moreover, the dFC community has not been using the most efficient algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently, which has prevented dFC from showing its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a framework that presents the most commonly used dFC measures in a common language and implements them in a computationally efficient way. This allows the study of brain activity at different spatio-temporal scales, down to the voxel level. DySCo provides a single framework that allows to: (1) Use dFC as a tool to capture the spatio-temporal interaction patterns of data in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. (2) Provide a comprehensive set of measures to quantify the properties and evolution of dFC over time: the amount of connectivity, the similarity between matrices, and their informational complexity. By using and combining the DySCo measures it is possible to perform a full dFC analysis. (3) Leverage the Temporal Covariance EVD algorithm (TCEVD) to compute and store the eigenvectors and values of the dFC matrices, and then also compute the DySCo measures from the EVD. Developing the framework in the eigenvector space is orders of magnitude faster and more memory efficient than naïve algorithms in the matrix space, without loss of information. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm from the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We show that all the proposed measures are sensitive to changes in brain configurations and consistent across time and subjects. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we performed the analysis at the voxel level, a task which is computationally demanding but easily afforded by the TCEVD.

                <p>by Joseph A Heng, Michael Woodford, Rafael Polania</p>

The ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. However, despite its importance, this sense is surprisingly imprecise and biased, and a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside (i) Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory information, (ii) logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and (iii) optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.

                <p>by Joseph Masison, Pedro Mendes</p>

Intestinal mucosal block is the transient reduction in iron absorption ability of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) in response to previous iron exposures that occur at the cell scale. The block characteristics have been shown to depend both on iron exposure magnitude and temporality, and understanding block control will enable deeper understanding of how intestinal iron absorption contributes to pathological iron states. Three biochemical mechanisms implicated in driving the block behavior are divalent metal transporter 1 endocytosis, ferritin iron sequestration, and iron regulatory protein regulation of iron related protein expression. In this work, a model of enterocyte iron metabolism is built based on published experimental data that is capable of reproducing the mucosal block phenomena. The model is then used to estimate the quantitative contribution of each of the three mechanisms on the properties of the mucosal block. Analysis reveals that ferritin and iron regulatory proteins are the main intracellular mechanisms contributing to the mucosal block, findings congruent with experimental predictions. Lastly, DMT1 endocytosis is shown to play a role in limiting total iron uptake by enterocytes but does not contribute to the decrease in total iron transfer across their basal membrane seen in the mucosal block.

                <p>by Panpan Li, Manfeng Zhang, Yihua Huang</p>

The prokaryote-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) peptide transporters are involved in various physiological processes and plays an important role in transporting naturally occurring antibiotics across the membrane to their intracellular targets. The dipeptide transporter DppABCDF in Gram-negative bacteria is composed of five distinct subunits, yet its assembly and underlying peptide import mechanism remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the DppBCDF translocator from <i>Escherichia coli</i> in both its apo form and in complexes bound to nonhydrolyzable or slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMPPNP and ATPγS), as well as the ATPγS-bound DppABCDF full transporter. Unlike the reported heterotrimeric <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DppBCD translocator, the <i>E. coli</i> DppBCDF translocator is a heterotetramer, with a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the C-terminus of each ATPase subunit. Structural studies reveal that ATPγS/AMPPNP-bound DppBCDF adopts an inward-facing conformation, similar to that of apo-DppBCDF, with only one ATPγS or AMPPNP molecule bound to DppF. By contrast, ATPγS-bound DppABCDF adopts an outward-facing conformation, with two ATPγS molecules glueing DppD and DppF at the interface. Consistent with structural observations, ATPase activity assays show that the DppBCDF translocator itself is inactive and its activation requires concurrent binding of DppA and ATP. In addition, bacterial complementation experiments imply that a unique periplasmic scoop motif in DppB may play important roles in ensuring dipeptide substrates import across the membrane, presumably by preventing dipeptide back-and-forth binding to DppA and avoiding dipeptides escaping into the periplasm upon being released from DppA.

                Background Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for this purpose due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features. However, the role of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing CNN performance for this task remains underexplored. Methods This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter tuning on CNN performance using the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark for digit recognition. The framework involves varying hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of convolutional layers, and optimization techniques. The Adam optimizer was employed to optimize the network, and experiments were conducted to assess the effect of adding extra convolutional layers on recognition accuracy. Results Our experiments achieved a 99.89% recognition rate on the MNIST dataset, surpassing prior benchmarks. This high accuracy was attained through systematic hyperparameter analysis and optimization. The addition of convolutional layers significantly contributed to improving the model’s performance by enabling deeper feature extraction and enhanced pattern recognition. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of hyperparameter tuning in CNN-based handwritten digit recognition. By providing insights into the impact of hyperparameters and architectural adjustments, it demonstrates how careful optimization can simplify processes and enhance accuracy in computer vision tasks. These findings pave the way for more effective and streamlined approaches to pattern recognition using deep learning techniques.
