">Neuronal SET1/COMPASS-mediated epigenetic regulation of de novo transcription drives accelerated forgetting with age</a></h4>

              
                Forgetting is a critical component of memory, but its molecular regulation - particularly with age - is not well understood. Epigenetic modifications are a candidate for this regulation and may further drive age-related behavioral decline, as they are dramatically altered in the aging brain. We found that multiple components of the SET1/COMPASS complex, a conserved histone methyltransferase complex associated with active gene transcription, are upregulated with age in the C. elegans nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of the SET1/COMPASS components improves memory in young adult animals and slows memory decline in old animals. By pharmacological and genetic inhibition, optogenetics, and neuronal mRNA and chromatin profiling, we demonstrate that SET1/COMPASS-mediated active transcription promotes forgetting. SET1/COMPASS regulates the de novo activity-dependent transcription and release of a neuropeptidergic signal from the AWC olfactory sensory neuron, which erases the associative memory trace in downstream motor neurons, resulting in forgetting. We further found that increased SET1/COMPASS-dependent chromatin accessibility at these gene loci with age primes these loci for transcription, resulting in accelerated forgetting. Our results reveal the role of active gene transcription in the regulation of forgetting and altered SET1/COMPASS- mediated gene transcription as a mechanism of cognitive decline, implicating increased expression of COMPASS components as a driver of increased forgetting in the aging brain. This mechanism may offer a new target for slowing loss of cognitive function with age.

">Neural heterogeneity shapes the temporal structure of human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) enables temporary retention of information essential for flexible cognition. Although persistent population activity has long been regarded as a principal mechanism of memory maintenance, continuous single-neuron firing is energetically demanding and difficult to reconcile with the heterogeneous firing properties of cortical neurons. Applying single-trial analyses to 902 neurons recorded from 21 neurosurgical patients performing a WM task, we found that maintenance was supported by transient, burst-like episodes of coordinated activity rather than sustained firing. Cross-temporal decoding exhibited localized generalization, and decoding accuracy increased with wider temporal windows, indicating that apparent persistence can emerge from temporally interleaved activity across neurons. We further developed a feature-based, putative cell-type classifier that revealed distinct circuit contributions: pyramidal neurons expressed content in burst-aligned events during maintenance, whereas interneurons were strongly modulated by memory load and behavior. Together, these findings reconcile dynamic and persistent accounts, indicating that human WM can emerge from temporally interleaved, cell-type-specific dynamics that provide a flexible and potentially metabolically efficient substrate for maintaining information over time.

">Spontaneous thought orientation tracked by fMRI networks and EEG alpha power dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how spontaneous, rather than experimentally induced, thoughts relate to brain activity remains a major challenge. We combined simultaneous fMRI and EEG recordings with Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES) to link momentary, naturally occurring experiences to their neural signatures during rest. Using machine-learning classification of 240 time-locked samples from eight participants, each completing nine 25-minute resting-state sessions, we reliably distinguished internally oriented from externally oriented experiences (fMRI accuracy = 65.4%, EEG = 62.5%). Externally oriented states showed greater fMRI activity in salience, auditory, and visuospatial networks and lower occipital alpha power in EEG, whereas internally oriented states exhibited the opposite pattern, extending prior DMN-focused accounts of internally directed states. Across modalities, integrated resting-state alpha power correlated negatively with BOLD fluctuations in parietal and occipital regions. These multimodal findings reveal distinct neural signatures of spontaneous experience and demonstrate that coordinated large-scale network dynamics and alpha-band oscillations track the natural alternation between inward and outward focus in the human mind.

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

                Student entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a driver of economic growth, innovation, and job creation, particularly in developing countries. However, limited financial literacy remains a major barrier to entrepreneurial success among students. This study aims to systematically review the role of financial literacy in supporting student entrepreneurship. A systematic search using the PRISMA 2020 method was conducted in Scopus for the period 2014–2024 with the following search string: (“financial literacy” AND entrepreneurship AND student*) OR (“financial literacy” AND “youth entrepreneurship”). From an initial 155 records, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, empirical, English language, and focusing on students in the context of entrepreneurship. The review identifies three main themes. First, the financial skills addressed include budgeting, saving and borrowing, cash-flow management, investment and risk assessment, and basic accounting. Second, approaches to improving financial literacy are primarily through integrated curricula, business simulations, student venture projects, and industry mentoring. Third, financial literacy strongly impacts entrepreneurial outcomes, including higher self-efficacy, better financial decision-making, stronger resilience in cash-flow management, and greater sustainability of student ventures. The findings underscore the importance of integrating financial literacy as core human capital within entrepreneurship education, especially in developing countries. Limitations of this review include reliance on Scopus and exclusion of non-English studies. The study provides theoretical, practical, and policy implications for universities, educators, and policymakers.

                Spontaneous gastric intramural hematoma (GIH) is an exceptionally rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We report the case of a 57-year-old man with no significant medical history who presented with hematemesis, melena, and hemodynamic instability. Upper endoscopy revealed a large submucosal hematoma with active bleeding. Despite endoscopic hemostasis and supportive management, hemorrhage persisted, requiring emergency partial gastrectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed submucosal hemorrhage without evidence of malignancy or vascular malformation. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering spontaneous GIH in the differential diagnosis of unexplained upper gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the role of timely surgical intervention when endoscopic therapy fails.

                Background Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a crucial facilitator for the digital transformation of organizations; however, its implementation in the higher education sector of fragile states is still insufficiently studied. This gap makes it harder for policymakers and higher education leaders in countries like Yemen to carry out structured, sector-wide modernization. Methods This study utilizes a systematic integrative review methodology, adhering to PRISMA principles. We synthesized and analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles and high-credibility reports published between 2010 and June 2025 to identify transferable EA frameworks, governance models, and implementation strategies pertinent to resource-constrained contexts in higher education. Results Our analysis confirms that the TOGAF framework is the most widely used, but it also indicates that successful public sector implementations depend on hybrid adaptations and federated governance models to attain a balance between central policy and institutional autonomy. The most important things that lead to success are strong executive sponsorship and a phased, pilot-led implementation. The primary problems are lack of resources and resistance from within the organization. The results also show a clear link between EA outcomes, such as improved efficiency and resilience, and the main goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conclusions This review expands EA theory into the inadequately explored area of public administration in fragile contexts. In practice, it provides Yemen with a new, evidence-based, phased implementation pathway. This pathway affords higher education sector leaders a real policy and management tool to help them build strong and useful digital ecosystems in tough places.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<p>The past decade has witnessed groundbreaking clinical implementation of neuroprosthetic limbs driven by signals from peripheral targets (eg, nerves and muscle) and the brain to restore limb function for individuals with limb loss or impairment. In this review, we highlight recent key clinical trials in peripheral neuroprosthetic interfaces directly with nerve, residual muscle, and reinnervated muscle. We then highlight the key advances in brain interfaces, including clinical trials using electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical electrodes to control neuroprosthetics. Finally, we explore the future of neuroprosthetic control where both peripheral and brain interfaces can be combined to improve neuroprosthetic performance.

                <p>Neurosyphilis remains an important and highly morbid neurologic infection. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of syphilis across a variety of populations, making recognition of the many neurologic complications of this infection still relevant for modern clinicians. As manifestations of neurosyphilis are famously varied, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in the face of atypical presentations. In this review, we discuss updates to the epidemiology, range of clinical presentations, diagnosis, and management of neurosyphilis. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1070–1076</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70020?af=R">Depression Polygenicity and Disease Activity and Disability Worsening in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A better understanding of factors associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability is needed. Given the strong link between comorbid depression and MS disease activity and disability, we aimed to determine whether the depression genetic burden, as modelled using its polygenic score, is associated with MS disease activity and disability worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, we used samples from neurologist-defined adult people with MS (PwMS) followed in clinical care or during a clinical trial from existing cohorts: Canada, the United States (US), and Sweden with extensive longitudinal phenotypes. We computed the depression polygenic score (PGS) and tested its association with annualized relapse rate and worsening disability. In the US cohort, we additionally explored the time to relapse, number of enhancing lesions, and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening during the study period.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 3,420 relapsing-onset PwMS of European genetic ancestry with a median follow-up of 3 to 5 years. Meta-analyses revealed for each 1-standard deviation increase in the depression PGS, the relapse rate increased (incidence rate ratio: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.50). In the US cohort, higher depression PGS was associated with protocol-defined relapses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03–2.43), and time to confirmed EDSS worsening (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.22) with this effect largely direct.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Meta-analyses showed a higher depression genetic burden was associated with increased MS disease activity. In the US clinical trial cohort only, we found a significant association between higher depression PGS and time to relapse and confirmed EDSS worsening. These findings may provide insights into MS disease activity and disability worsening. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1057–1069</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27306?af=R">Clinical and Molecular Genetic Characterization of Landau Kleffner Syndrome: An Observational Cohort and Experimental Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:951–966</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Overactivity of muscles is thought to be involved in postural abnormalities (PA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the relationship between muscle activity and postural parameters to explore the peripheral mechanisms of PA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 90 PD patients and 19 healthy controls were enrolled. Posture features (F1–F8) and the index for PA were collected. Surface electromyography was acquired from cervical and thoracolumbar muscles during lying, sitting, standing, and walking, respectively. Follow-up was completed for a subset of PD patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and external oblique muscle, were higher in PD patients with PA (PD_PA) than PD patients without PA (PD_NPA) and healthy controls during lying and standing. Extensor activity in PD_PA patients increased only in the antigravity position compared with PD_NPA patients. Spearman's correlation showed that RMS amplitude of SCM in the lying position was associated with index for PA and forward flexion angles including F3–F8, whereas RMS amplitude of the external oblique muscle in the lying position was correlated with F5 alone. Longitudinal analysis showed that changes in F3, F4, and index for PA were significantly correlated with changes in RMS amplitude of the SCM in the lying position. Additionally, PD_NPA patients with SCM overactivity had a significantly higher risk of progressing to PA than those with normal SCM activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The SCM and external oblique muscle are involved in forward trunk flexion in PD patients, while extensors may play a compensatory role. SCM may be the key muscle in PA for PD patients, participating in the pathogenesis of PA. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:967–976</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intracranial language localization with electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and high-gamma modulation (HGM) mapping relies on artificial, repetitive tasks, requiring sustained cooperation from patients. Herein, we tested the validity of unstructured, interpersonal, naturalistic conversation for language localization, using a novel methodology: Behavior-iEEG-Spectral-Power correlation (BESPoC). We first validated BESPoC against ESM, HGM, and neuropsychological outcomes using well-established language tasks, then demonstrated the validity of naturalistic conversation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 134 patients (59 females), aged 2–29 years, undergoing standard-of-care stereo-electroencephalography monitoring who engaged in picture naming, auditory naming, story listening, and conversed with a family member. ESM and HGM analysis were performed using established methods. BESPoC methodology quantified correlation between stereo-electroencephalography spectral power from task recordings, obviating the need for any trial-based epochs, and behavioral markers. The large sample size allowed mixed-effects modeling to compare BESPoC with HGM and ESM.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>BESPoC showed high specificity (0.79–0.83) and sensitivity (0.64–0.86) for localizing HGM language sites across the tasks. BESPoC also compared well with HGM across all language tasks for localizing ESM speech/language sites. With conventional tasks, BESPoC was superior to HGM for modeling neuropsychological deficits seen, despite preserving ESM speech/language sites. Naturalistic conversation compared well with standard tasks for localization of HGM and ESM language sites, and determined neuropsychological outcomes better than conventional tasks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using BESPoC methodology naturalistic conversation is shown to produce valid cortical language maps of both expressive and receptive language, and determine neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1096–1110</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:977–990</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of multiple system atrophy (MSA). We investigated these effects in a proof-of-concept clinical trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this single-center, randomized, open label trial, participants with MSA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg weekly for 48 weeks, or as controls, followed by a 48-week washout period. The primary outcome was the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) parts I + II combined score at 48 weeks. Objective secondary outcome measures included the numbers of participants losing ambulation; scoring ≥ 3 on UMSARS part I items for falls, speech, swallowing, as well as timed walking and measures of quality of life and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between September 23, 2020, and May 6, 2022, 50 participants were recruited (25 in each group). At 48 weeks, UMSARS parts I + II scores had worsened by 6.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0 to 9.3, SD = 6.9) in the exenatide group and by 13 3 points (95% CI = 9.2 to 17.3, SD = 9.4) in the control group, an adjusted mean difference of −7.4 points (−11.3 to −3.6, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). There were no statistically significant differences at either 48 or 96 weeks in the secondary outcome measures. Biomarker analysis of neurofilament light chain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein oligomer load, sensor-derived gait measures, and imaging findings were also similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Exenatide was associated with positive effects on participant-reported symptoms and clinician-rated MSA severity. In contrast, none of the objective comparisons differed according to randomization. Given the open label trial design, the discrepancy between the primary outcome and the objective measures may be explicable as placebo effects/observer bias.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing antemortem indicators of AD pathophysiology, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis. However, these biomarkers may not capture a frequent coincident pathology, such as cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured plasma amyloid-<i>β</i>40, amyloid-<i>β</i>42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, tau phosphorylated at threonine 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in 685 multiancestral individuals who had clinical assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The cohort was represented by individuals of European, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Participants were then classified as biomarker-positive or -negative for AD based on previously established cutoffs: 2.65 pg/mL for, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 and 0.39 pg/mL for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217. We used magnetic resonance images to compare white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), silent brain infarcts, microhemorrhages, and hippocampus volume across groups by their clinical diagnosis and biomarker status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the P-tau181 group (<i>n</i> = 685), 70 individuals (10.2%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A total of 40 (57%) were biomarker-positive for AD, and 30 were classified as other dementia. Among 615 without dementia, 265 (40.3%) were preclinical AD, and 348 (50.8%) were biomarker-negative controls. In the tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 group (<i>n</i> = 535), 54 (10.1%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, including 33 biomarker-positive for AD and 21 with other dementia, whereas 183 (38.0%) were preclinical AD and 298 (61.9%) were biomarker-negative controls. Across both classifications, biomarker-positive for AD and other dementia individuals showed greater WMH volumes, more infarcts, and smaller hippocampus. However, P-tau217 positivity was more sensitive to WMH volume differences, whereas tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 better captured hippocampal atrophy and silent brain infarcts. Interestingly, ethnic differences may also influence detection of changes in WMH volumes, hippocampal volume, and infarcts in relation to specific biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate that cerebrovascular disease is consistently involved in dementia either directly or as a coincident pathology in AD. These results underscore the need to incorporate both blood-based biomarkers and structural imaging in the evaluation of patients with dementia. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1027–1043</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70011?af=R">Proteomics and the Risk of Incident Embolic and Thrombotic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Personalized approaches to ischemic stroke diagnosis are needed. We determine differences in proteomic signatures of incident embolic (EIS) and thrombotic stroke (TIS) by age and resultant pathways using large-scale proteomics.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) from visit 2 (V2, 1990–1992) until 2020 without prevalent stroke with available SomaScan data (4,955 protein targets) at V2 (mid-life, n = 10,929), and then again at visit 5 (V5, 2011–2013, n = 4,463) were included. Covariate adjusted Cox hazard models determined the association between proteins, and adjudicated incident EIS or TIS from V2 to V5 and from V5 to 2020.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 10,929 participants (56% female, 23% Black, follow-up ~20 years), 20 proteins measured in mid-life were associated with either EIS (n = 168) or TIS (n = 459) in mid-life, and 4 measured in late-life were associated with late-life stroke (73 EIS and 124 TIS events) at the Bonferroni threshold <i>p</i> &lt; 1E−5. In mid-life, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) was significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS (<i>p</i>-difference = 9.14E−7). Nineteen mid-life proteins were strongly associated with TIS; 7 strongly associated with TIS and only nominally (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) with EIS and the remaining 12 with TIS only. In late-life, NPPB, serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 4, oligodendrocyte-myelin-glycoprotein, and neurocan-core protein were significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools implicated cancer for EIS-associated proteins, whereas TIS pathways reflected cell-structure and atherogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified plasma proteins associated with risk of EIS versus TIS reflecting distinct stroke mechanisms: cardiac dysfunction protein in EIS (eg, NPPB) and inflammation dysregulation in TIS (eg, interleukins). ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1125–1135</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70014?af=R">Elevated Risk of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Rupture during Pregnancy and Puerperium</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) pose a significant risk during pregnancy because of hormonal changes and increased hemodynamic stress. This study aims to assess the risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy and puerperium and to identify risk factors associated with rupture.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study included 588 women with AVMs and a history of pregnancy, enrolled from a nationwide registry in China between August 2011 and August 2021. A case-crossover design was used to compare rupture risk during pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnancy periods, adjusting for clinical and morphological factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The risk of AVM rupture was significantly higher during pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy periods (4.5% vs 1.6%; risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–4.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk was particularly elevated during the second and third trimesters. Key factors independently associated with increased rupture risk included adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy (adolescent ≤19 years or advanced ≥35 years, odds ratio [OR], 8.32; 95% CI, 2.09–28.12, <i>p</i> = 0.001), a history of AVM rupture before pregnancy (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.37–11.40; <i>p</i> = 0.007), diffuse nidus (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07–5.12; <i>p</i> = 0.033), and multifetal pregnancy (OR 18.31; 95% CI, 1.14–293.27; <i>p</i> = 0.040).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy substantially increases the risk of AVM rupture, particularly during the second and third trimesters and compared to pre-first pregnancy periods. Risk factors such as adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy and multifetal pregnancy further increase the risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management during pregnancy for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1136–1145</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70015?af=R">Anterior Versus Posterior Insular Epilepsy: Correlations with Semiology Based on Stereoelectroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well-defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG-confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non-invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co-occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (<i>p</i> = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1), blinking (<i>p</i> = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (<i>p</i> = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non-painful somatosensory aura (<i>p</i> = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo-electro-clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1111–1124</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27307?af=R">Mapping Postictal Aphasia through Signal Complexity: A Stereo‐Electroencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The postictal period provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology underlying aphasia and recovery following epileptic seizures. This study examines postictal aphasia in stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)-explored patients to identify brain regions associated with task-specific language deficits using signal complexity analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated video-SEEG-recorded focal seizures with and without postictal aphasia in patients with SEEG-confirmed hemispheric language dominance. SEEG traces were analyzed using permutation entropy (PE), with the postictal period quantified by a PE-based metric, the Postictal Alteration Time (PAT). Brain region PAT was correlated with language function recovery (eg, repetition). Electro-clinical recuperation was also assessed within the dorsal-ventral language stream framework. Additionally, a bedside testing battery was developed to evaluate postictal aphasia severity and task-specific deficits.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 322 seizures from 98 patients were analyzed. Seizures with postictal aphasia had longer PAT than those without. Task-specific language recovery correlated with regional PAT (eg, naming – middle temporal gyrus). Moreover, the dorsal stream recovered faster than the ventral stream. Additionally, the Postictal Aphasia Scale (PAS) was developed, evaluating naming, reading, repetition, and comprehension (verbal and written) and automatic speech. Higher PAS scores (indicating milder deficits) correlated with faster regional complexity recovery. At 5 and 10 minutes postictally, PAS revealed a global aphasia pattern, with comprehension deficits gradually resolving. By 15 minutes, aphasia was primarily production-related, particularly affecting naming.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of postictal aphasia and introduces PAS as a tool for assessing postictal aphasia severity and domain-specific deficits, aiding surgical planning and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1080–1095</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1014–1026</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To examine volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and healthy controls (HC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized vMRI in MOGAD were compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched MS (5:1), and non-matched NMOSD and HC, in mixed linear models with time and group interactions. Disability assessments included; patient determined disease steps (PDDS), manual dexterity (MDT), walking speed (WST), processing speed (PST), and contrast sensitivity tests (CST). Correlations between vMRI and disability in MOGAD were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 293 patients were included; 32 MOGAD, 160 MS, 49 NMOSD, and 52 HC. MOGAD had a faster rate of volume loss in all brain regions compared to HC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At baseline, MOGAD had preserved thalamic (0.000507, <i>p</i> = 0.005), caudate (0.000287, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and putamen (0.000341, <i>p</i> = 0.007) fractions than MS. Longitudinally, MOGAD had increased lateral ventricle fraction (LVF) (−0.000645, <i>p</i> = 0.032), but less hippocampal (0.000031, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and upper cervical cord area (UCCA) loss (1.482887, <i>p</i> = 0.005), compared to NMOSD. MOGAD had increased LVF (0.00529, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but less UCCA loss (0.538656, <i>p</i> = 0.042) longitudinally compared to MS. Among MOGAD, UCCA was associated with PDDS (−0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and CST (0.60, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Whole brain fraction (WBF) was associated with PDDS (−0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and PST (0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.019). LVF was associated with PDDS (0.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOGAD showed longitudinal brain volume loss compared to HC. Deep gray matter was relatively preserved compared to MS, while MS and NMOSD had greater UCCA loss, indicating regional differences in atrophy. Despite less overall atrophy, volume loss in MOGAD was associated with disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1044–1056</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1004–1013</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological pathway with vital roles in intracellular homeostasis. During autophagy, defective cargoes including mitochondria are targeted to lysosomes for clearance and recycling. Recessive truncating variants in the autophagy gene <i>EPG5</i> have been associated with Vici syndrome, a severe early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with extensive multisystem involvement. Here, we aimed to delineate the extended, age-dependent <i>EPG5</i>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated clinical, radiological, and molecular features from the largest cohort of <i>EPG5</i>-related patients identified to date, complemented by experimental investigation of cellular and animal models of EPG5 defects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Through worldwide collaboration, we identified 211 patients, 97 of them previously unpublished, with recessive <i>EPG5</i> variants. The phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations to milder isolated neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel Epg5 knock-in mouse model of a recurrent <i>EPG5</i> missense variant featured motor impairments and defective autophagy in brain areas particularly relevant for the neurological disorders in milder presentations. Novel age-dependent neurodegenerative manifestations in our cohort included adolescent-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline, and myoclonus. Radiological features suggested an emerging continuum with brain iron accumulation disorders. Patient fibroblasts showed defects in PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagic clearance and α-synuclein overexpression, indicating a cellular basis for the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>EPG5</i> knockdown caused motor impairments, defective mitophagic clearance, and changes in mitochondrial respiration comparable to observations in <i>C. elegans</i> knockdown of parkinsonism-related genes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings illustrate a lifetime neurological disease continuum associated with pathogenic <i>EPG5</i> variants, linking neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders through the common denominator of defective autophagy. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:932–950</p>

                <p>by Logan A. Becker, Francois Baccelli, Thibaud Taillefumier</p>

Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.

The detection and characterization of fluorescent puncta are critical tasks in image analysis pipelines for fluorescence imaging. Existing methods for quantitative characterization of such puncta often suffer from biases and limitations, compromising the reliability and reproducibility of results. Moreover, the widespread adoption of many available analysis scripts is often hampered by over-optimization for specific samples, requiring extensive coding knowledge to repurpose for other datasets. We present <i>WormSNAP (Worm SyNapse Analysis Program)</i>, a license-free, stand-alone, no-code approach to automated unbiased detection and characterization of 2D fluorescent puncta, originally developed to characterize images of the synapses residing in <i>C. elegans</i> nerve cords but suitable for broader 2D fluorescence image analysis. <i>WormSNAP</i> incorporates a local means thresholding algorithm and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficient and accurate analysis of large datasets, with user control of thresholding and restriction parameters and visualization options for further refinement. <i>WormSNAP</i> also calculates three types of correlation metrics for 2-channel images, enabling users to select the ideal metric for their dataset. <i>WormSNAP</i> provides robust and accurate fluorescent puncta detection in a variety of conditions, accelerating the image analysis workflow from data acquisition to figure generation.

                <p>by Atte S. A. Eskelinen, Joonas P. Kosonen, Moustafa Hamada, Amir Esrafilian, Cristina Florea, Alan J. Grodzinsky, Petri Tanska, Rami K. Korhonen</p>

Degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury. Injurious overloading-induced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation. One early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading. Yet, the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining time-dependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone. Here, we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation in fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic cartilage after single injurious overloading (50% compressive strain magnitude, 100%/s strain rate) followed by physiological cyclic loading (15% strain, 1 Hz, haversine waveform). The simulated adaptation of aggrecan content was compared spatially and at several time points to tissue composition found in Safranin-O-stained sections of young bovine knee cartilage subjected to the same loading protocols. Incorporating mechanical strain-driven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release, fluid flow-driven aggrecan depletion, and fluid pressure-stimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis, the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14%-points greater near-lesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading. The near-lesion aggrecan loss was driven by fluid flow and proteolytic aggrecanase activity, while chondroprotective pro-anabolic responses (increased aggrecan biosynthesis) were prominent in the deeper tissue despite damaged superficial layer. This significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies, such as rehabilitation protocols and tissue-engineered constructs.

                <p>by Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is one of the richest open‑source repositories in biology, housing over 242,000 macromolecular structural models alongside much of the experimental data that underpins these models. By systematically collecting, validating, and indexing these models, the PDB has accelerated structural biology discoveries, enabling researchers to compare new entries against a vast archive of solved structures and, more recently, powering protein structure prediction. Leveraging this wealth of data, structural bioinformatics has uncovered patterns, such as conserved protein folds, binding‑site features, or subtle conformational shifts among related proteins, that would be impossible to detect from any single structure. Through the democratization of structural data and open-source analytical tools, now amplified by the power of large language models, a broader community of researchers is equipped to drive new scientific discoveries using structural data. However, good structural bioinformatics requires understanding some of the nuances of the underlying experimental data, data encoding conventions, and quality control metrics that can affect a model’s precision, fit‑to‑data, and comparability. This knowledge, combined with developing good controls, statistics, and connections to other databases, is essential for drawing accurate and reliable conclusions from PDB data. Here, we outline 10 recommendations for doing structural bioinformatic analyses crafted to pave the way for others to uncover exciting discoveries.

                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyze the observed events frequencies and their characteristics during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed “observed events” replays to determine frequencies and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven “observed events” occurred, with frequencies of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Observed event frequency rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with observed event occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle-related events were the most frequently observed during the 2021 AFCON, with older age and longer playing time identified as key associated factors. These events were more prevalent in ALP compared to NALP.

                Background Land tenure inequality and the risk of land grabbing are persistent challenges in Indonesia, particularly within Special Economic Zones (SEZs). While SEZs are designed to attract investment and foster economic growth, they frequently lead to large-scale land acquisitions that can compromise the rights and livelihoods of local communities. Methods This study investigates the juridical-empirical aspects of land tenure within three Indonesian SEZs: Lido, Tanjung Lesung, and Mandalika. A qualitative approach was adopted, utilizing a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) framework. Data collection involved document analysis, community surveys, and in-depth interviews with two respondents to gather both legal perspectives and lived experiences. Results The findings reveal that land tenure practices within SEZs exacerbate the risks of land grabbing, undermine customary land rights, and offer limited economic advantages, particularly concerning the absorption of local labor. Conclusion Addressing these critical issues necessitates enhanced legal protection, transparent land registration processes, robust community participation, and empowerment strategies. These measures should ensure that investment incentives are aligned with principles of fairness and sustainability. By framing agrarian justice as a core analytical lens, this research proposes a model for more equitable land governance within Indonesian SEZs and beyond.

                This study aims to explore influential and relevant factors affecting organizational performance. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was employed to address this objective. The systematic literature review in this study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PRISMA was chosen because it provides a comprehensive and relevant framework for reviewing literature related to the research topic. Additionally, it offers a systematic protocol that enhances the quality and clarity of research reporting. Data were obtained from the Scopus database, covering publications from 2019 to 2024. The articles analyzed were selected based on predefined criteria. The findings reveal that the key determinants of organizational performance include knowledge management, sustainable development, performance assessment, supply chain management, and human resource management. These findings offer practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance their performance. The novelty of this study lies in its exclusive focus on uncovering the complex factors that influence organizational performance using the SLR method grounded in the PRISMA approach. By adopting this method, the study aims to provide deeper insights and nuanced understanding that goes beyond general knowledge, thereby enriching academic literature with a fresh perspective on the multifaceted factors shaping organizational success.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical studies can experience major loss to follow-up and reduced response rates to participant reported outcomes such as quality of life questionnaires, which can lead to a lack of statistical power for the analysis of these outcomes. A number of studies have been embedded within trials to investigate interventions to improve retention. Methods A Study Within a Trial (SWAT) was integrated into the Outcome Monitoring After Cardiac Surgery (OMACS) study, a large observational cardiac surgery study, to investigate whether the use of a theory-informed cover letter with 12-month follow-up questionnaires could improve study retention. OMACS study participants receiving 12-month follow-up questionnaires by post were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a standard cover letter or a theory informed cover letter with their questionnaires. Study retention was assessed by the proportion of participants who returned 12-month follow-up questionnaires. Results Questionnaire return rates were similar between the two groups (67.4% with the standard cover letter compared to 68.5% with the theory-informed cover letter, odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.85 to 1.31]). The results of the OMACS SWAT were consistent with the previously reported meta-analysis (MA) by Gillies et al., with a revised risk difference of 3% (95% CI -1% to 6%) when including OMACS in the MA. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a theory-informed cover letter to increase study retention. We would recommend study teams explore alternative strategies for improving retention where needed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78077?af=R">Sensorimotor Cortex High Frequency Oscillations Characterize Motor Symptom Severity during Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implant in the subthalamic nucleus and its associated “microlesion” effect impacts oscillatory activity in the hand area of motor cortex.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined cortical local field potentials in 31 patients before and after subthalamic nucleus lead implant at rest and during repetitive voluntary and passive contralateral upper limb movements. We computed continuous wavelet transforms of the signals and correlated (1) baseline spectral power and motor symptom severity and (2) changes in spectral power and contralateral motor symptoms related to microlesion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline motor symptom severity correlated with high-frequency broadband power in primary motor cortex during voluntary movements (200–300Hz: Pearson's r = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.15, 0.75]; and 300–500Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.70]). Motor improvements from lead implant correlated with decreases in high gamma power in primary sensory cortex during voluntary movements (70–200Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.035, 95% CI: [−0.07, 0.62]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>How motor parkinsonism alters electrophysiology in cerebral cortex is unclear. Our findings suggest that both the severity of parkinsonism and its improvement from the microlesion effect are associated most closely with changes in high-frequency oscillatory activity in primary sensorimotor cortex. Better understanding the cortical dynamics of movement disorders could guide novel paradigms for adaptive DBS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1187/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence Adoption as a Driver of Innovation and Competitiveness in SMEs: A Bibliometric and Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study employs a bibliometric and systematic literature review (B-SLR) approach, guided by the PRISMA 2021 framework, to investigate the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024 across the Scopus databases, the review integrates quantitative mapping and qualitative synthesis to identify emerging research patterns, thematic concentrations, and methodological trends. The findings reveal a marked surge in scholarly engagement since 2020, reflecting growing recognition of AI as both a strategic and operational driver of competitiveness in SMEs. Three dominant thematic clusters emerge: (1) AI-driven innovation, encompassing applications such as machine learning, predictive analytics, automation, and process optimization; (2) entrepreneurial decision-making, highlighting how AI supports opportunity recognition, strategic planning, and market sensing; and (3) adoption barriers and enablers, focusing on organizational readiness, digital infrastructure, human capital, and financial capability. While the field demonstrates expanding theoretical and practical interest, significant gaps remain regarding methodological diversity, contextual variation across developing economies, and the integration of socio-ethical considerations in AI adoption. The study contributes by consolidating fragmented knowledge, mapping the intellectual structure of the domain, and offering actionable implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to leverage AI to foster innovation, digital resilience, and sustainable growth in SMEs.

                The study of familial SI-NETs using single-cell RNA-seq identifies the putative cell of origin and stage-specific gene expression driving early tumor development. These findings offer insights into the precursor-to-tumor transition and potential advances in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

                Mpox virus (MPXV) causes life-threatening mpox disease in HIV-positive individuals. Stampfer et al. evaluated 15 HIV-positive mpox survivors and detected polyfunctional MPXV-specific CD4 and CD8 immunity along with strong binding and neutralizing antibodies. These were even stronger in the 7/15 patient subsets with prior smallpox vaccination who also had broader immunity.

                Chen et al. describe how TMX2, a thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein, moderates oxidative conditions at the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact site (ERMCS). This allows TMX2 to limit mitochondrial metabolism as well as ERMCS formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100799">Cryo-electron tomography reveals the microtubule-bound form of inactive LRRK2</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments requires LRRK2’s kinase to be in the active-like conformation. However, whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain is in the inactive conformation and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase active site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we show that full-length human LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter and less regular, suggesting they are less stable.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101113">Septins function in exocytosis via physical interactions with the exocyst complex in fission yeast cytokinesis</a></h4>

              
                Septins can function as scaffolds for protein recruitment, membrane-bound diffusion barriers, or membrane curvature sensors. Septins are important for cytokinesis, but their exact roles are still obscure. In fission yeast, four septins (Spn1–Spn4) accumulate at the rim of the division plane as rings. The octameric exocyst complex, which tethers exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane, exhibits a similar localization and is essential for plasma membrane deposition during cytokinesis. Without septins, the exocyst spreads across the division plane but is absent from the rim during septum formation. These results suggest that septins and the exocyst physically interact for proper localization and function. Indeed, we predicted six pairs of interactions between septin and exocyst subunits by AlphaFold, most of them are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Exocyst mislocalization results in mistargeting of secretory vesicles and their cargos, which leads to cell-separation delay in septin mutants. Our results indicate that septins guide the targeting of the exocyst complex on the plasma membrane for vesicle tethering during cytokinesis through physical interactions.

">ZMYND11 Restrains KMT2A to Enable a Neuronal Developmental Program</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the chromatin reader and tumor suppressor ZMYND11 are the cause of ZMYND11-related syndromic intellectual disability (ZRSID), a disorder characterized by symptoms such as language and motor delay, behavioral disruptions, and seizures. We find that neuronal deletion of ZMYND11 in mice causes aberrant upregulation of non-neuronal gene programs, leading to reduced dendritic branching and spine density, as well as hyperactivity and abnormal motor behavior. We investigated the mechanism by which ZMYND11 regulates gene expression and discovered that ZMYND11 interacts with and inhibits the histone methyltransferase KMT2A (MLL1), a transcriptional co-activator which contributes to oncogenic and developmental gene programs. We find that a ZRSID-associated ZMYND11 point mutation abrogates ZMYND11 interaction with KMT2A, suggesting that this interaction is critical for the function of ZMYND11 in regulating brain development. Using a degron-tagged ZMYND11 mouse model to enable the rapid degradation of ZMYND11 in primary cortical neurons, we show that gene expression changes induced by ZMYND11 loss are attenuated by treatment with the KMT2A inhibitor revumenib, a drug which has recently been approved for the treatment of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our findings shed light on the convergence of chromatin mechanisms regulating neuronal gene expression and raise the possibility that modulation of KMT2A activity may be a useful therapeutic avenue for ZRSID.

">Interaural time and level differences contribute differently to source segregation and spatial selection</a></h4>

              
                Interaural time and level differences are crucial in sound localization, yet their contributions to sound source segregation and spatial selection remain underspecified. Here, participants completed a spatial auditory selective attention task while we measured hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Participants listened to a target sound stream and a simultaneous spatially separated speech stream or white noise masker. Sound streams were spatialized with either 50 s ITDs, 500 s ITDs, naturally occurring ILDs from a non-individualized HRTF, or broadband 10 dB ILDs. Behavioral results revealed a stronger effect of spatial cues when the masker was speech. Error patterns differed in the two difficult conditions, small ITDs and natural ILDs: small ITDs produced lower hit rates, while naturally occurring ILDs produced higher false alarm rates. Small ITDs led to greater activity in prefrontal cortex and activity in superior temporal gyrus that was lateralized, greater in the hemisphere contralateral to attentional focus, consistent with previous reports. These results suggest that natural ILDs alone support source segregation even if they are insufficient to cause large shifts in perceived lateralization, explaining high false alarm rates (confusions between target and distractor words). In contrast, small ITDs alone may be insufficient to segregate competing sources, leading to low hit and false alarm rates. Together, these results reveal differences in how ITDs and ILDs contribute to auditory scene analysis and spatial attention.

">Exploring the Restoration of Memory Post-NeuronalRegeneration from Induced ALS-FTD in Dugesia tigrina</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive neuronal loss and motor decline. Recovery remains beyond therapeutic reach, and even complete neurogenesis does not ensure preservation of memory capacity (defined as the strength of synaptic connections). Freshwater planarians, capable of whole-body regeneration and associative learning, provide a tractable model to study the relationship between neuronal damage and behavior. Their "single-circuit" centralized nervous systems allow evaluation of oxidative stress, a key driver of ALS-FTD pathology, which was induced via hydrogen peroxide. In this study, 180 planaria underwent three phases. Phase 1 established baseline memory using a 28-day operant conditioning protocol with a light-based training device. Success was determined by the proportion of planaria in concentric circles defined as zones (A-C) with a respective gradient descent of light concentration. Phase 2 determined hydrogen peroxide (H2O2;) concentrations sufficient to induce oxidative stress that triggered regenerative signaling and neuronal damage without lethality. Phase 3 applied the optimal concentration, allowed regeneration, and retested memory. The optimal concentration of hydrogen peroxide was 5 ppm, triggering blastema formation and neuronal damage while preserving viability. Zone occupancy analyses utilizing prior found concentration revealed measurable post exposure shifts: Zone A increased initially but trended lower post-exposure, Zone B increased, and Zone C decreased significantly. These results indicate that while memory capability persists after neurogenesis, the quality of memory decreases. In accordance with this study, current treatments for ALS-FTD that focus solely on neurogenesis will not fully restore cognitive function.

">HaloTrace: A spatiotemporally precise fluorescent readout of blood-brain barrier permeability in mice</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an indispensable, selectively permeable interface that controls the entry and exit of nutrients, ions and waste products into the brain. Despite its biological importance, most measurements of BBB permeability rely on dyes that suffer from nonspecific signals, lack of spatial fidelity, and incompatibility with longitudinal or repeated measurements. Here we present HaloTrace: a method which leverages the HaloTag ligand-receptor tool to generate a precise spatiotemporal readout of BBB integrity that avoids major pitfalls of existing methods. We present evidence that the fluorescent HaloTag ligand has minimal interactions with blood contents but can enter the brain specifically at sites of BBB dysfunction, where it covalently binds to nearby HaloTag receptors. The ligand accumulates in the brain during its short lifetime in circulation and is stably anchored in place for at least 24 hours. Unlike existing tracers, free ligand is not retained in the blood vessels at detectable levels, so the entirety of ligand fluorescence represents true BBB leakage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HaloTrace can quantify BBB permeability at multiple discrete timepoints prior to the experiment endpoint. This offers researchers the ability to study the progression or resolution of BBB permeability in a way current methods cannot. HaloTrace is thus uniquely poised to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of BBB leakage in mouse models.

">Paediatric MRI: High-Resolution in vivo 3T Methods</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for investigating the brain in vivo but is limited by image resolution and scan artefact. In paediatric research, these limitations are compounded by reduced participant compliance, which in turn necessitates shorter scan times to minimise motion artefacts, resulting in less than satisfactory image resolution. We report here methods for MRI acquisition which afford high-resolution, low-noise, paediatric brain data in under nine-minute scans, and novel post-processing with our code freely available at https://osf.io/ckh5t/. Whole-brain in vivo single-participant images were generated at 0.5mm isotropic resolution. This resolution permitted accurate delineation of fine structures, including the hippocampal subfields. The ability to resolve intricate structures in paediatric data provides a tool for studying brain development and its disruption in neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

">Inherent coupling of perceptual judgments to actions in the mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity during perceptual tasks is distributed across many cortical regions, but it remains unclear where perceptual judgments are made and whether they are encoded independently of the resulting actions. To address these questions, we designed a vibrotactile detection task in which mice flexibly switched between standard and reversed contingency blocks, requiring them to lick when a stimulus was present or absent, depending on the block. A cortex-wide optogenetic screen revealed that the premotor cortex is important for perceptual judgments rather than for the ability to lick. However, we did not find action-independent coding of perceptual judgments in the premotor cortex or other cortical regions; instead, coding of perceptual judgments was coupled to actions. Finally, we identified a subset of premotor cortex cells whose activity encoded the current block identity. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which vibrotactile perceptual judgments are inherently, but flexibly, coupled to actions.

">Characterization of cutaneous reflexes elicited from saphenous nerve stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a chronic neuropathic condition that affects amputees. Cutaneous reflexes (CRs), mediated by spinal interneuronal circuits, represent a potential pathway linking non-nociceptive input to nociceptive modulation that could be targeted with neuromodulatory techniques such as operant conditioning. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel method for eliciting CRs from proximal muscles via saphenous nerve stimulation to enable future applications in individuals with PLP. We recruited 14 healthy adults and elicited CRs in the rectus femoris muscle via transcutaneous stimulation of the saphenous nerve at multiple stimulation intensities below their pain thresholds. We evaluated the consistency and reliability of CR response latencies and magnitudes, comparing the symmetry between the bilaterally (e.g. right and left legs). We found that CRs could be reliably elicited 50-100ms post-stimulus using saphenous stimulation and that responses were reliable at stimulation intensities below pain thresholds. Furthermore, we found the CR responses were relatively symmetrical in our healthy adult population. This study is the first of its kind to show that proximal (vs distal) CRs could be consistently elicited through the saphenous nerve stimulation. These findings imply that proximal CRs maybe a feasible target for ne

">Midbrain microglia-integrated organoids as a next-generation tool for chronic morphine withdrawal research: A pilot study</a></h4>

              
                In the midst of an opioid epidemic, opioid use disorder (OUD) can lead to significant clinical impairment or distress (such as opioid dependence and/or addiction) and overdose deaths. Therefore, it is significant to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of OUD and identify more effective therapies. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids are self-organized 3D tissues and mimic in vivo human organs. Increasingly, human-specific features of opioid abuse are being investigated using emerging brain organoids, which faithfully model the key functional, structural and biological complexities of neural tissues. However, a significant limitation of brain organoids is the absence of microglia which plays a fundamental role in OUD-related remodeling of neural circuits. In this pilot study, using hiPSC KOLF2.1J cell line, we developed our approach for generating both midbrain organoid and microglia and verified that our midbrain organoid was successfully integrated with microglia. We found that chronic exposure to morphine triggers key elements of immune responses including increased TNF signaling and downregulation of sirtuin3 (Sirt3, a mitochondrial protein, preventing oxidative stress) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD, located in the mitochondrial matrix) in microglia-organoid co-cultures. Our findings suggest that immunocompetent midbrain organoids provide excellent models with which to study human-specific mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. By combining disease relevance with scalability, the model system can be utilized as an effective tool for drug screening and toxicity testing.

">Modified self-amplifying RNAs mediate robust and prolonged gene expression in the mammalian brain</a></h4>

              
                In self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), substitution of cytidine with 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (hm5C) reduces innate immune responses and prolongs protein expression. When formulated as a vaccine and administered intramuscularly, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) loaded with modified saRNA (saRNA-LNPs) afford robust and long-term protein expression. Here we report the protein expression and cell type tropism of modified saRNA-LNPs, encoding fluorescent proteins, when injected in the mammalian brain. saRNA encapsulated in an LNP formulation comprising ALC-0315 (present in Comirnaty) efficiently mediates robust and long-lasting protein expression in brain cells beyond five weeks, with detectable expression in some neurons at three months. hm5C saRNA substantially outperforms N1m{Psi} mRNA. Intriguingly, in addition to transfecting astrocytes and neurons at the injection site, saRNA-LNPs labels neurons retrogradely. Thus, saRNA-LNPs are an exciting nonviral gene transduction method that effectively transduces brain cells with excellent potency and mediates prolonged gene expression.

">Optimizing the Characterization and Quantification of Retinal Ganglion Cell Somas in Healthy and Injured Retinas Using Cellpose</a></h4>

              
                Quantification of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) soma number and characterization of somal features are commonly used output metrics for investigation of optic neuropathies. Many investigators still perform these quantifications by hand, which is time consuming and prone to bias. Cellpose is an open-source Python package that can perform cellular segmentation and holds promise for automating somal analyses. Here, we designed a custom script incorporating the Cellpose package and custom-trained Cellpose models that are capable of automatic characterization and quantification of RGC somas. Our script, using our models, is capable of automatically counting RGC somas, along with characterizing RGC somal size. Further, we show that Cellpose can quantify RGCs using multiple cell-type specific markers and has the potential to quantify RGCs across the entire retina. Together, our custom Cellpose models and script which generates and analyzes Cellpose outputs provides a powerful tool for all-in-one RGC somal analysis.

">Reciprocal regulation of the H3 histamine receptor in Rett syndrome and MECP2 Duplication 1 syndrome: implications for therapeutic development</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT) and MECP2 Duplication syndrome (MDS) are disorders caused by reciprocal decreases and increases, respectively, in expression of the methyl reader protein, Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator that induces changes in the expression of thousands of genes. We previously performed an mRNA expression profiling study of the temporal cortex region from a cohort of autopsy samples from patients diagnosed with RTT and corresponding age, postmortem interval, and sex-matched controls. These studies identified a significant reduction in the expression of the histamine H3 receptor (HRH3) in RTT patients compared to controls. In the current manuscript, we expand this H3 receptor profiling to additional RTT patient brain samples representing distinct disease mutations and confirm significantly reduced levels of H3 receptor expression in the majority of patients compared to controls. Using mouse models of RTT and MDS, we observed reciprocal changes in H3 receptor expression across various brain areas, with Hrh3 expression being reduced in RTT model animals and increased in a mouse model of MDS. We then tested the hypothesis that phenotypes in these mouse models would be sensitive to an H3 receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively. This point is particularly salient for MDS, as there are no approved treatments available; encouragingly, however, the H3 antagonist/inverse agonist pitolisant (Wakix) has recently been approved for the treatment of narcolepsy, and we sought here to determine if there was potential to repurpose pitolisant for MDS. We evaluated both a small molecule agonist of the H3 receptor, (R)-[alpha]-methylhistamine (RAMH), and pitolisant in RTT and MDS models, respectively, to determine impacts on phenotypes in these disease models. Our results show that RAMH significantly impacted an anxiety phenotype in mice modeling RTT (MecpNull/+), but pitolisant had no effect on the behaviors examined here in MDS animals (MECP2Tg1).

">Integration of Nuclear Receptors into a Schwann cell Gene Regulatory Network</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral nerve function depends on the proper formation and maintenance of Schwann cells. During development, large diameter axons are enveloped by single, myelinating Schwann cells whereas clusters of small diameter axons are surrounded by nonmyelinating Schwann cells in Remak bundles. The transcription factor SRY-box 10 (SOX10) is required for the development of Schwann cells, but its functions in different neural crest and glial lineages have shown that SOX10 commonly cooperates with other transcription factors to activate cell-specific gene programs. In a previous study, we compared SOX10-bound regulatory elements in Schwann cells and identified a specific enrichment for nuclear receptor motifs at SOX10 binding sites in Schwann cells. NR2F1 and NR2F2 (Coup-TFI/Coup-TFII) are expressed from neural crest through Schwann cell maturity, and knockdown of nuclear receptors Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 in primary Schwann cells downregulated several myelin genes. In this study, we have identified a NR2F-regulated target gene network in Schwann cells, which revealed enrichment for nonmyelinating Schwann cell genes. Cut&Run assays in S16 Schwann cells revealed novel, genome-wide binding sites of NR2F2 and two downstream transcription factors: 1) Retinoid X Receptor Gamma (RXRG), which is also expressed preferentially in nonmyelinating Schwann cells, and 2) TEA-Domain factor (TEAD1), which is an important HIPPO pathway component required for Remak bundle formation. Our study elucidates the transcriptional cooperation that programs the regulatory network in nonmyelinating Schwann cells.

                Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is diagnosed using radiological imaging and biomarker analysis, each with certain limitations. Accurate and accessible detection of TBI is essential for its treatment. Since interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18 are key neuroinflammatory cytokines, we aim to investigate the regulation of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 in TBI patients and assess their potential as biomarkers of TBI. Methods Forty TBI and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this study. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was used to assess the clinical severity of TBI. Spearmans rank-order correlation was employed to find the association between GCS scores and IL levels. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human IL-1{beta} and IL-18 ELISA kits was conducted to measure the serum IL-1{beta} and IL-18 levels. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were measured to assess the potential of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 as biomarkers. Results The patients had mild TBI (mTBI) with a mean GCS score of 11.05 {+/-} 1.67. A negative correlation was found between GCS scores and IL levels. IL-1{beta} levels in the TBI and healthy subjects were 1882.19 {+/-} 796.72 pg/mL and 1473.50 {+/-} 333.045 pg/mL, respectively, with a significant difference (p = 0.001). Moreover, the IL-18 levels in TBI subjects (25.92 {+/-} 14.81 ng/L) were also significantly higher (p = 0.000) compared to those of the control group subjects (19.14 {+/-} 2.99 ng/L). The IL-1{beta} exhibited an AUC of 0.72 with 72.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity, at a cut-off point of 1527.25 (pg/mL), while IL-18 had an AUC of 0.78 with 77.5% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity, at a cut-off point of 19.645 (ng/L). Conclusions IL-1{beta} and IL-18 levels were increased remarkably in mTBI patients and exhibited fair potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI.

                Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and related dementias; yet peripheral biomarkers for neuroinflammation remain an unmet medical need. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a dual role in maintaining homeostasis under physiological conditions and driving neuronal damage when chronically dysregulated. One mechanism by which microglia influence their environment is through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and non-vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs), which can serve as biomarkers the reflect cellular states. Here, we systematically isolated and characterized microglia-derived EVs and NVEPs under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions and profiled their small RNA cargo by small RNA sequencing. We validated these findings in human iPSC-derived microglia and further recapitulated them in EVs and NVEPs from mouse brain and plasma. Using an engineered mouse model, we were able to isolate plasma microglia-specific EVs in vivo and demonstrated that their RNA cargo reflects their inflammatory state. Importantly, microglial EVs and NVEPs display distinct a2,6-sialylation patterns and small RNA signatures implicated in neurological diseases. These findings demonstrate that microglia-derived EVs and NVEPs cargo reflect microglial cellular state and establish them as putative minimally non-invasive biomarkers of early-stage neurodegenerative diseases.

Chronic pain is increasingly recognized as a key risk factor for delirium, and microglial activation may be the central mediator linking these two conditions. Methods: We used a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of persistent neuropathic pain in tandem with a postoperative delirium (POD) mouse model. Pain assessments, electroencephalography (EEG) recording, and immunofluorescence were performed to characterize pain and delirium-like states. Microglia were isolated for RNA-seq to elucidate gene expression changes comprehensively. Results: SNI mice showed persistent mechanical hypersensitivity from Day 7 onwards and demonstrated disrupted sleep-wake patterns in EEG indices. Immunofluorescence revealed sustained microglial activation in both the hippocampus and cortex following SNI. RNA-seq analyses indicated the upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., interleukin-6 production, NF-{kappa}B signaling) in SNI mice that also underwent head-mount surgery. Notably, the coincidence of persistent pain and an acute delirium-like state further exacerbated neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that neuropathic pain-induced microglial activation primes the brain for exaggerated inflammatory responses under additional surgical stress, potentially worsening delirium. Further investigations into microglia-focused therapies may inform novel strategies for mitigating delirium in patients with neuropathic pain.

">Temporal dynamics of peri-microsaccadic modulations within the foveola</a></h4>

              
                Microsaccades are small, rapid eye movements that shift the center of gaze by less than half a degree. While they have traditionally been associated with perceptual modulations and covert attention shifts in extrafoveal vision, recent evidence indicates that microsaccades also modulate perception within the central fovea in a spatially selective manner. However, the temporal dynamics of these modulations in fine spatial discrimination remain largely unexplored. Here we used high-precision eye tracking and gaze-contingent display control to achieve accurate localization of the line of sight and to restrict visual stimulation to selective locations within the central fovea during instructed microsaccades. Our results show that visual performance peaks approximately 70 milliseconds before microsaccade onset at the target location, while perception at equally eccentric, non-target foveal locations is concurrently impaired. This is followed by a generalized suppression phase while the microsaccade is in flight, when fine spatial discrimination drops to near-chance levels. Visual performance then recovers rapidly at the target location, returning to baseline within 100 milliseconds after microsaccade landing. Our findings demonstrate that visual discrimination within the central fovea is modulated following a distinct temporal profile and in a spatially selective way around the time of microsaccade execution.

">Y-maze and Vertical Pole Performance Correlate with Fine Motor Learning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                When a new memory is consolidated, it can leave behind a residual trace that affects the formation of subsequent memories for similar tasks. However, the relationships between distinct abilities and their interdependencies during memory tasks and motor learning activities are not clear. An important question is whether being proficient in memory or motor learning tasks also translates into better performance in another, similar task - reflecting potential generalization of motor learning abilities. To investigate the correlation between memory performance and motor learning in mice, we used a combination of behavioral tasks that assess general exploratory behavior, declarative memory, and fine motor learning. For the exploratory behavior, we used the Open Field task, and assessed declarative memory using the Novel Object Recognition and Y-maze. Motor learning was assessed through the Vertical Pole and Pellet Reaching task. We found a negative correlation between the Vertical Pole task and the motor learning task, where a shorter time for an individual to turn on a pole correlated with an increased number of attempts to reach a sugar pellet in the motor learning task. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between the Y-maze and the motor learning task, where a higher exploration rate indicated a higher success ratio in the pellet reaching task. These results can be used to conduct a pre-study for challenging motor tasks that include pre-behavioral procedures on mice. Our study indicates that both the Vertical Pole and the Y-maze can be suitable predictors of motor learning performance and activity.

">Non-decision time-informed collapsing threshold diffusion model: A joint modeling framework with identifiable time-dependent parameters</a></h4>

              
                Over the past sixty years, evidence accumulation models have emerged as a dominant framework for explaining the neural and behavioral aspects of the process underlying decision making. These models have also been widely used as a measurement instrument to assess individual differences in latent cognitive constructs underlying decision making. A central assumption of most of these models is that decision makers accumulate noisy evidence until a fixed decision threshold is reached. However, both behavioral and neuroscientific findings, along with theoretical considerations related to optimality, have suggested that the decision threshold varies over time. Although time-dependent threshold models often provide a better account of empirical data, a major challenge associated with these models is the unreliable estimation of their parameters. This limitation has led researchers to emphasize model-fitting comparisons rather than interpreting parameter values or accounting for individual differences in the dynamics of the decision threshold. In this work, we address the reliability issue of parameter estimation in time-dependent threshold diffusion models by proposing a joint modeling approach that links non-decision time to external observations. Parameter recovery simulations demonstrate that informing the diffusion model with trial-level noisy measurements of non-decision time substantially improves the reliability of parameter estimation for time-dependent threshold diffusion models. Additionally, we reanalyzed the experimental data from two perceptual decision-making tasks to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed modeling approach. Non-decision time measurements were extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using the hidden multivariate pattern method. The cognitive modeling results revealed that, in addition to the reliable parameter estimation, constraining non-decision time improves the fit to behavioral data.

">In-ear-tACS: Auditory Perception and Side Effects depend on Electrode Montage, Frequency, and DC-Offset</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the cochlea might be a promising new therapeutic option for patients with chronic tinnitus. However, electric stimulation of small, sensitive target regions, such as the inner ear, can cause ad-verse side effects (SEs). Objective: To identify stimulation parameters with low side-effect profiles while reliably stimulating the cochlea, thereby improving patient comfort and safety and paving the way for the development of a medical device for treating patients with chronic tinnitus. Approach: Hearing-healthy participants were stimulated with electrodes in the ear canal. Stimulation of the cochlea elicits a soft hearing impression (HI) in participants, indicating successful stimulation of the early auditory pathway. We systematically compare HS and SEs across distinct electrode configurations and stimulation parameters, including stimulation frequency and the presence of a Direct Current (DC)-offset. We record SE occurrence via vis-ual analog scales after stimulation. Main Results: We find that tACS stimulation between 250 and 2000 Hz reliably elicits HIs in participants. SEs are generally low. No occurrence of SEs resulted in participant withdrawal or severe adverse events, with only phosphenes, skin tingling, and a sense of vibration being reported as impactful. The addition of a slight DC-offset increases the occurrence and magni-tude of SEs considerably. Significance: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of tACS in non-invasively stimulating the auditory pathway with minimal adverse SE. Stimulation parameters with a low SE profile can be applied in further studies with tinnitus patients.

">Aligning transformer circuit mechanisms to neural representations in relational reasoning</a></h4>

              
                Relational reasoning-the capacity to understand how elements relate to one another-is a defining feature of human intelligence, yet its computational basis remains unclear. Here, we combined human neuroimaging (7T fMRI) and artificial neural network modeling to examine relational reasoning in biological and artificial systems. Using the Latin Square Task, we found that humans and transformers were able to generalise the task reliably, while standard architectures used in cognitive neuroscience could not. Analysing the transformer components revealed distinct computational roles: positional encoding captured the spatial structure of the task and aligned with representations in visual cortex, whereas attention encoded relational structure and mapped onto frontoparietal and default-mode networks. Attention weights tracked the relational complexity of the task, providing a computational analogue of working-memory demands. These results demonstrate convergent computational strategies for reasoning in brains and transformers, highlighting attention-based architectures as powerful models for investigating the neural basis of higher cognition.

">Exploring the Neural Correlates of Body Perception Disturbance with a Visual Hand Morph Illusion in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: An fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain condition whose causal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Individuals with CRPS often experience distorted perceptions of their affected limb in terms of size and shape, accompanied by feelings of dislike and disownership. These features are collectively referred to as body perception disturbances (BPD). Evidence that both BPD and pain can rapidly reduce following a visual hand morph illusion suggests modulation of central body representations. To elucidate the neural correlates underlying these rapid perceptual changes, we investigated brain activity during the hand morph illusion using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-four participants (22 with upper limb CRPS, 22 pain free controls) completed the hand morph illusion task during fMRI and provided trial-by-trial ratings of ownership, likeability, and pain of their affected hand. People with CRPS showed greater activation of the left premotor cortex (PMC) during the illusion compared with controls. Functional connectivity between the left PMC and right extrastriate body area (EBA) was also revealed in CRPS during the illusion. No main effects of the illusion, relative to a sham condition, were found on pain intensity, limb ownership, or likeability ratings. These findings provide the first identification of neural correlates of body perception disturbance in CRPS, implicating PMC EBA networks in altered body representation. Further neuroimaging research is required to define the neural signature underlying this disturbance.

">A more comprehensive and reliable analysis of individual differences with generalized random forest for high-dimensional data: validation and guidelines</a></h4>

              
                Analyzing individual differences in treatment or exposure effects is a central challenge in psychology and behavioral sciences. Conventional statistical models have focused on average treatment effects, overlooking individual variability, and struggling to identify key moderators. Generalized Random Forest (GRF) can predict individualized treatment effects, but current implementations suffer from two critical limitations: (1) prediction performances vary substantially across random initializations, and (2) identification of key moderator is limited in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce two methodological advances to address these issues. First, a seed ensemble strategy stabilizes predictions by aggregating models trained under different random initializations. Second, a backward elimination procedure systematically identifies key moderators from high-dimensional inputs. Simulation analyses across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable and valid predictions across random seeds, improved performance in moderator identification, and robust generalization of independent data. To facilitate adoption and interpretation, we provide step-by-step guidance using large-scale neuroimaging dataset (N = 8,778) with reusable code. These enhancements make GRF more reliable for modeling individual differences in treatment effects, supporting data-driven hypothesis generation, and identification of responsive subgroups.

">Impact of Alzheimer's disease risk factors and local neuromelanin content on the transcriptomic landscape of the human locus coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small noradrenergic nucleus in the dorsal pons that sends projections across the brain regulating sleep, arousal, attention, stress responses, and some forms of cognition. LC neurons show pathology in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including age-related accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) and accelerated loss of neuromelanin (NM) pigmentation. NM-sensitive neuroimaging of the LC predicts previous cognitive decline, clinical severity, and future AD progression. While these findings suggest that the LC plays an etiologic role in AD, the molecular landscape of the LC prior to clinical manifestation of sporadic AD remains largely uncharacterized. This information is critical for developing interventions that preserve LC integrity and function. We performed spatially-resolved transcriptomics on 85 sections of human postmortem LC from N=33 neurotypical middle-aged donors, balanced for epidemiologic AD risk factors including sex, African or European ancestry, and APOE genotype (carriers of the E4/risk or E2/protective alleles). Comparing across APOE genotypes, we find astrocytic gene expression differences proximal to LC neurons. Associating NM content with local gene expression, we show that higher overall APOE gene expression correlates with reduced NM content and an enrichment of NM-associated genes in aging pathways. Unexpectedly, we find enriched LC expression of cholesterol synthesis genes, alongside evidence for lipid synthesis gene regulatory network activity in NM-containing LC specifically, revealing a potential intersection between intrinsic lipid metabolism in LC neurons, NM, and the role of APOE-mediated lipid biology in AD. Together, these data illuminate the molecular features of the human LC at spatial resolution with unprecedented sampling depth, revealing how AD risk factors and NM content influence resilience and susceptibility of this critical brain nucleus to pathology accumulation and degeneration.

                Aging is associated with immune dysregulation in brain and is the biggest risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases whereas rejuvenation interventions can mediate beneficial effects. Microglia are considered as a major player in the development of neurodegenerative disease yet, the molecular changes underlying brain aging and rejuvenation remain poorly understood at the single cell level. We identified and benchmarked several reproducible microglial states and a core set of genes leading to microglia activation in the mice brain. We investigated microglial heterogeneity and studied the impact of aging and parabiosis-mediated exposure of young and old blood on microglia subpopulations across four different brain regions including cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. We revealed region specific differences in microglia subpopulation composition and age-related changes, with cerebellum and striatum displaying the most distinctive profiles and dynamic shifts compared to other brain regions. We consistently observed cerebellum as the most responsive, while striatum appeared distinctive by its minimal responsiveness to these interventions. Our findings highlighted the role of microglia in brain regional vulnerability and provided a foundation for microglia-targeted treatment for modulating brain aging.

">Diverse ways of holding verbal information in mind revealed with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Individual differences in left anterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive neuroscience has identified brain systems that reliably underpin specific abilities, including verbal short-term memory. However, there is no simple mapping between anatomy and function; moreover, brains are differently organised across people. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, and using transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to test causality, we characterised differences in the neural processes supporting verbal short-term memory in healthy participants who varied in their reliance on semantic information. In group analyses, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed the expected pattern for a 'phonological buffer' - this site was responsive to phonological tasks and verbal short-term memory for meaningless items. However, the functions of this site differed across the sample; individuals with the strongest semantic reliance in short-term memory showed weaker phonological responses. They also showed more activation when maintaining meaningful word sequences in short-term memory, compared with nonwords. In these semantically reliant participants, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed stronger functional connectivity to limbic and default mode regions during nonword rehearsal. While inhibitory stimulation to phonologically responsive regions disrupted nonwords more than words in people with good phonological short-term memory, these effects were reversed when verbal short-term memory was more semantically reliant. These findings show that left anterior inferior parietal cortex supports the maintenance of different kinds of verbal information across individuals.

">Position-dependent effects of SCN2A premature stop codons on neuronal excitability and behavior</a></h4>

              
                SCN2A encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, a key determinant of spike initiation and propagation in glutamatergic neurons. Premature termination codons are often assumed to produce uniform haploinsufficiency via nonsense-mediated decay, yet whether distinct SCN2A premature stop codons yield equivalent molecular, cellular, and behavioral outcomes remains unknown. We generated two mouse lines carrying patient mutations -- Scn2aY84X/+ (p.Tyr84UAA; early coding sequence) and Scn2aR1627X/+ (p.Arg1627UGA; terminal coding exon) -- on a C57BL/6J background. Allele-specific expression was quantified by targeted next-generation sequencing of whole-brain reverse transcribed cDNA. NaV1.2 protein was measured in half-brain lysates by automated western blot and ex vivo whole-cell recordings were obtained from layer 5b pyramidal-tract neurons in medial prefrontal cortex. A panel of behavioral assays assessed locomotion/exploration, motor learning, anxiety-like behavior, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and seizure susceptibility. Allele-specific RNA handling diverged by position: mRNA carrying Y84X engaged partial nonsense-mediated decay, whereas R1627X transcripts were at allelic balance. Despite this difference in RNA fate, NaV1.2 protein was comparably reduced in both lines. Electrophysiologically, both premature termination codon mutations slowed the action-potential upstroke, with a larger decrement in Scn2aY84X/+ than in Scn2aR1627X/+. Spike threshold was depolarized only in Scn2aY84X/+, whereas Scn2aR1627X/+ remained similar to wild type. Frequency-current relations showed reduced firing at near-rheobase inputs in both mutants, with responses approaching wild type at stronger currents. Behaviorally, locomotion, sociability, and sensorimotor gating were preserved. Both lines exhibited increased grooming, consistent with restrictive, repetitive behavior; Scn2aY84X/+ alone showed greater exploration in the elevated-risk context and a male-predominant deficit in rotarod learning. In maximal electroshock testing, mortality was lower in both lines without differences in seizure threshold or severity. Our results show that distinct SCN2A premature termination codons are not equivalent to one another, nor to a uniform haploinsufficient state. An early, nonsense-mediated decay-competent premature stop codon (Y84X) and a terminal-exon one (R1627X) produce partially overlapping yet allele-specific effects on neuronal excitability and behavior. These findings establish premature termination codon position as a determinant of phenotype, supporting allele-tailored mechanistic studies and therapeutic strategies.

">PCSK9 and High-Fat Diet Synergistically Induce Neurovascular Dysfunction and Neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is strongly linked to metabolic risk factors and represents a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. The interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors driving cerebrovascular pathology in metabolic syndrome are poorly understood. Here, we characterize neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative phenotypes in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome with atherosclerosis induced by hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) overexpression combined with high-fat diet (HFD). PCSK9+HFD mice exhibit hallmark features of CSVD including vascular rarefaction, impaired neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier disruption, white matter injury, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, we identify lipid-droplet accumulating microglia (LDAM) as a distinct cellular phenotype that emerges in response to metabolic stress and correlates with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Three-dimensional light sheet microscopy reveals widespread vascular network disruption. Immunophenotyping demonstrates that microglia in PCSK9+HFD group exhibit enhanced phagocytic activation and ramification complexity yet accumulate perivascular amyloid-{beta}, suggesting impaired clearance capacity. Importantly, we observed vascular amyloid-{beta} deposition in wild-type mice without genetic Alzheimer's disease mutations, suggesting that metabolic stress contributes to cerebrovascular amyloid pathology. PCSK9+HFD mice displayed recognition memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. Our findings establish that severe hypercholesterolemia accelerates CSVD pathogenesis, and identify LDAM as a distinct pathological feature linking systemic metabolic syndrome to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment.

                <p>by Brónagh McCoy, Rebecca P. Lawson</p>

Anxiety is known to alter learning in uncertain environments. Experimental paradigms and computational models addressing these differences have mainly assessed the impact of volatility, with more highly anxious individuals showing a reduced adaptation of learning rate in volatile compared to stable environments. Previous research has not, however, independently assessed the impact of both changes in volatility, i.e., reversals in reward contingency, and changes in stochasticity (noise) in the same individuals. Here, in an original online study (Experiment 1; N = 80) and a pre-registered replication attempt (Experiment 2; N = 160), we use a simple probabilistic reversal learning paradigm to independently manipulate the level of volatility and noise at the experimental level in a fully orthogonal design. We replicate previous studies showing general increases, irrespective of anxiety levels, in positive learning rate (Experiment 1) and negative learning rate (Experiments 1 and 2) for high compared to low volatility, but here only in the context of low noise. Across both experiments, there was an interaction between volatility and noise on behaviour, with more win-stay responses for high compared to low volatility under low noise, but similar or fewer win-stay responses for the same comparison under high noise. The impact of anxious traits presented differently across experiments; in Experiment 1, increases in lose-shift responses in high versus low noise conditions scaled with level of anxious traits, whereas in Experiment 2, there was a full interaction between volatility, noise and anxious traits on win-stay behaviour. These anxiety-related lose-shift or win-stay differences were reflected in their corresponding negative and positive reinforcement learning rate parameters, respectively. Experiment 2 represents a more robust set of results with a larger sample size, balanced gender representation, and extended block order balancing. These findings suggest that changes in both sources of uncertainty - stochasticity and volatility - should be carefully considered when investigating learning and how learning is shaped by anxiety.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly central to biomedical research, the need for trustworthy models is more pressing than ever. In this paper, we present nine concise and actionable tips to help researchers build ML systems that are technically sound but ethically responsible, and contextually appropriate for biomedical applications. These tips address the multifaceted nature of trustworthiness, emphasizing the importance of considering all potential consequences, recognizing the limitations of current methods, taking into account the needs of all involved stakeholders, and following open science practices. We discuss technical, ethical, and domain-specific challenges, offering guidance on how to define trustworthiness and how to mitigate sources of untrustworthiness. By embedding trustworthiness into every stage of the ML pipeline – from research design to deployment – these recommendations aim to support both novice and experienced practitioners in creating ML systems that can be relied upon in biomedical science.

                <p>by Leyao Wang, Mengyuan Zhao, Hao Xie, Yuqing Qian, Wenhuan Lu, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can significantly affect RNA expression, gene regulation, and determination of cell fate. As a common and abundant post-transcriptional modification (PTM) of RNA, m6A is also closely associated with the occurrence of numerous diseases. Thus, identifying the m6A modification site in the RNA sequence is a prerequisite for related research. High-throughput sequencing technology has high requirements and low cost performance. Computational methods have made encouraging progress in site prediction. However, most models only consider the effects of different species, ignoring the simultaneous exploration of RNA modifications in different tissues within the same species. We develop and validate a fuzzy system based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL), named BSBL-TSK-FS, which is a powerful sequence-level m6A prediction model. We introduce a Bayesian method that provides a posterior probability output to produce more sparse solutions so that the model has higher accuracy. The model classifies the m6A sites in several tissues of mouse, human, and rat. Under the five-fold cross-validation method (5-CV), the precision of the BSBL-TSK-FS model is 0.84 0.95. The accuracy of our model improves by 9.4% over the existing SOTA predictors. BSBL-TSK-FS achieves superior performance over current SOTA methods. Finally, in order to verify the generalizability of the model, we carry out cross-species tests, and the results prove the robustness and adaptability of the model. An accurate and reliable sequence modification prediction model is developed to better understand the complex landscape of methylation modification.

                <p>by Adina Matache, Joao Rodrigues Lima-Junior, Maxim Kuznetsov, Konstancja Urbaniak, Sergio Branciamore, Andrei S. Rodin, Peter P. Lee, Russell C. Rockne</p>

Prior studies have shown that approximately 40% of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) patients harbor immune signaling defects in their blood at diagnosis, and the presence of these defects predicts overall survival. Therefore, it is of interest to quantitatively characterize and measure signaling errors in immune signaling systems in these patients. Here we propose a novel approach combining communication theory and signal processing concepts to model ligand discrimination in immune cells in the peripheral blood. We use the model to measure the specificity of ligand discrimination in the presence of molecular noise by estimating the probability of error, which is the probability of making a wrong ligand identification. We apply our model to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway using high dimensional spectral flow cytometry measurements of transcription factors, including phosphorylated STATs and SMADs, in immune cells stimulated with several cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) from 19 ER+ breast cancer patients and 32 healthy controls. In addition, we apply our model to 10 healthy donor samples treated with a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor. Our results show reduced ligand identification accuracy and higher levels of molecular noise in BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which may indicate altered immune signaling and the potential for immune cell dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, the inhibition of JAK1/2 produces a unique pattern of signaling dysfunction, inducing increased ligand detection error rates and reduced signal-to-noise ratios for most immune cell subtypes. These results suggest a means to improve the use of signaling kinase inhibitor therapies by identifying patients with favorable ligand discrimination specificity profiles in their immune cells.

                <p>by Aapo E. Korhonen, Olli Sarala, Tuomas Hautamäki, Markku Kuismin, Mikko J. Sillanpää</p>

Gaussian graphical models (GGM) are powerful tools to examine partial correlation structures in high-dimensional omics datasets. Partial correlation networks can explain complex relationships between genes or other biological variables. Bayesian implementations of GGMs have recently received more attention. Usually, the most demanding parts of GGM implementations are: (i) hyperparameter tuning, (ii) edge selection, (iii) scalability for large datasets, and (iv) the prior choice for Bayesian GGM.
To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Bayesian GGM using a hierarchical matrix-F prior with a fast implementation. We show, with extensive simulations and biological example analyses, that this prior has competitive network recovery capabilities compared to state-of-the-art approaches and good properties for recovering meaningful networks. We present a new way of tuning the shrinkage hyperparameter by constraining the condition number of the estimated precision matrix. For edge selection, we propose using approximated credible intervals (CI) whose width is controlled by the false discovery rate. An optimal CI is selected by maximizing an estimated F<sub>1</sub>-score via permutations. In addition, a specific choice of hyperparameter can make the proposed prior better suited for clustering and community detection. Our method, with a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, computationally outperforms existing Bayesian GGM approaches that use Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.
The method is implemented in the R package HMFGraph, found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph. All codes to reproduce the results are found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph-Supplementary.

Scientific progress relies on science’s capacity for self-correction. If erroneous articles remain unchallenged in the publication record, they can mislead future research and undermine evidence-based decision-making. All articles included in a systematic review of animal studies on early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed for image-related issues. We included 608 articles, of which 243 articles were identified as problematic (40.0%). Of the 243 problematic articles, 55 (22.6%) have been corrected, 7 (2.9%) have received an expression of concern, 5 (2.1%) were marked with the Taylor & Francis under investigation pop-up, and 19 (7.8%) were retracted. In 9 of the 55 corrected articles (16.4%), new problems were found after correction or not all issues were resolved in the correction. Most (<i>n</i> = 213, 87.7%) problematic articles had a corresponding author affiliated to an institute from China. Our results show that the self-correcting mechanisms in science have stalled in this field of research. Our findings provide insight in the prevalence of image-related issues and can help publishers to take appropriate action. We can only uphold science’s capacity for self-correction when problematic articles are actively identified by peers, and when publishers take swift and adequate action to repair the scientific record.

Assessing species geographic distributions is critical to approximate their ecological niches, understand how global change may reshape their occurrence patterns, and predict their extinction risks. Yet, species records are over-aggregated across taxonomic, geographic, environmental, and anthropogenic dimensions. The under-sampling of remote locations biases the quantification of species geographic distributions and ecological niche for most species. Here, we used nearly one thousand environmental DNA (eDNA) samples across the world’s oceans, including polar regions and tropical remote islands, to determine the extent to which the geographic and ecological niche ranges of marine fishes are underestimated through the lens of global occurrence records based on conventional surveys. Our eDNA surveys revealed that the known geographic ranges for 93% of species and the ecological niche ranges for 7% of species were underestimated, and contributed to filling them. We show that the probability to detect a range filling for a given species is primarily shaped by the GBIF/OBIS sampling effort in a cell, but also by the number of occurrences available for the species. Most gap fillings were achieved by addressing a methodological sampling bias, notably when eDNA facilitated the detection of small fishes in previously sampled locations using conventional methods. Using a machine learning model, we found that a local effort of 10 eDNA samples would detect 24 additional fish species on average and a maximum of 98 species in previously unsampled tropical areas. Yet, a null model revealed that only half of ecological niche range fillings would be due to eDNA surveys, beyond a random allocation of classical sampling effort. Altogether, our results suggest that sampling in remote areas and performing eDNA surveys in over-sampled areas may both increase fish ecological niche ranges toward unexpected values with consequences in biodiversity modeling, management, and conservation.

<p>This essay describes the development of the in vitro hippocampal slice technique and my small contributions to it and to influencing Roger Nicoll's early interests in the hippocampus and LTP. My Ph.D. work at Harvard with Timothy Teyler was on field potential studies of synaptic plasticity, including LTP, in the rat in vitro hippocampal slice. As a postdoc, I introduced the slice preparation to Roger Nicoll's lab at UCSF but failed to interest him in LTP. Here I explain how Nicoll's scientific philosophy both motivated me to develop our first submersion slice chamber and kept him from investigating LTP for nearly a decade. Finally, I recount the history of the name “LTP.”</p>

     alt="Timing of Delamination of Inner Ear Neurons Specifies Their Topography and Target Innervation"/>
<p>Developmental time can encode positional information.
Timing of delamination of otic neuroblasts specifies their final positions within the auditory-vestibular ganglion.
Target innervation choice of the sensory epithelium and organisation of fibres in the 8th nerve are also augured by the time when a neuroblast leaves the otic epithelium.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurons of the inner ear delaminate from a sensorineurogenic epithelium in the ventral part of the otocyst. Delaminated neuroblasts then condense to form the acoustico-vestibular ganglion (AVG). As they differentiate, the neurons connect mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear with their targets in the hindbrain in a precise topographical manner. However, it is unclear how or when positional identities of neurons are specified within the AVG, such that topographical information from HCs is maintained into the auditory centers of the brain. Here, we find that the time of delamination from the otocyst correlates with neuroblast position in the ganglion. Using markers for neuronal differentiation, we find that the ganglion differentiates from a dorsal to ventral wave. Neurons that differentiate first innervate the vestibular apparatus, including the lagena and the proximal regions of the BP. Using sequential somatic cell labeling, we find that the central projection also follows a similar dependency on delamination order. Our studies show that the time of delamination of otic neuroblasts presages their target innervation choice and fiber positions within the developing eighth cranial nerve. We suggest that temporal information specifies the spatial identities during early inner ear neuron development.</p>

     alt="Brain-Wide Patterns of CRF Receptor 1 Expression in the Transgenic CRFR1-Cre-2a-tdTom Rat"/>
<p>In this article, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre-2A-tdTomato rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns. We further demonstrate that Cre recombinase expression in CRFR1 neurons can be used to express virally delivered transgenes, which can be used to trace CRF-responsive neuronal circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to manipulate neurons that express corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or its receptors has led to many new discoveries about how CRF signaling modulates stress-related behaviors in mice. However, similar advances in rats have been limited by the lack of reporter lines targeting CRF receptors, restricting access to behavioral paradigms that are more suitable for, or specific to, rats. Here, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns, as determined by in situ hybridization in rats and by genetic labeling in CRFR1 transgenic mice. We detail expression patterns at multiple rostrocaudal levels to validate the use of this transgenic rat in multiple neural circuits that signal via CRF activation of CRFR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of Cre recombinase, combined with viral vector delivery, can be used to trace CRFR1-expressing neurons and their axonal terminals in target regions. This study is intended to serve as a resource for examining the expression pattern of CRFR1 and as a validation of the CRFR1-Cre rat for reliable use with Cre-dependent viral approaches to manipulate and/or record the activity of CRFR1-expressing neurons in distinct brain regions. We expect that the availability of the CRFR1-Cre rat, along with an increasing number of transgenic rat lines, will further expand our understanding of how CRF transmission mediates stress responses by leveraging the behavioral strengths of the rat as a model system.</p>

                Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) analyses are essential in clinical research and medical decision-making. Despite the availability of R packages such as pROC and ROCR, their use often requires programming expertise, limiting accessibility for many clinical researchers. An interactive, code-free method is therefore needed to enhance usability and understanding. We developed DTAShiny, an R Shiny based web application that allows users to upload diagnostic data sets in CSV or Stata formats, perform DTA metric calculations, and generate dynamic visualizations. The application is built using shiny, bs4Dash, pROC, ggplot2, and other packages. It includes heuristic-based automatic detection of reference and test variables and offers real time threshold adjustment via an interactive slider. DTAShiny computes standard sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC and advanced F1 score, balanced accuracy. These DTA metrics are accompanied with approximate confidence intervals. The tool generates ROC and PR curves, distribution plots, and a calibration style plot. Real-time interactivity enables users to observe trade offs as thresholds change. This Zenodo deposit contains the DATAShiny source code, an example anonymised dataset, and documentation to run the app locally.

                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakhs population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there are deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system still exists due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health engineering department.

                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that has been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the salivary levels human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), and to assess their diagnostic potential using ROC curve analysis in periodontitis patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Our findings showed that salivary HLA-DR4 levels were significantly lower in patient groups compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000), whereas salivary MMP-8 and ACPA levels were significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.034) and (P = 0.001) respectively, with no significant differences between the patient groups(P > 0.05). On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls (P = 0.001), with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                Background The translation of research evidence into routine healthcare practice is often slow and inconsistent, even timely implementation can significantly improve patient outcomes. While implementation science offers strategies to close this gap, current approaches are frequently manual, fragmented, and poorly integrated within healthcare systems. To address these challenges, we propose ImpleMATE – an AI-powered implementation science platform designed to streamline implementation efforts. Grounded in the Learning Health System (LHS) model, ImpleMATE aims to establish a continuous, data-driven cycle of learning and improvement in implementation practice. Methods ImpleMATE will be developed through a co-design and co-production approach rooted in human-centred design principles. Development will proceed through four key activities: (1) establishing a data processing pipeline and building an implementation-focused ontology; (2) creating and validating an AI system to extract implementation knowledge, structure the ontology, and support implementation solution delivery; (3) designing an interactive web application to deliver AI-powered decision support and streamline implementation processes; and (4) developing an evaluation framework to assess platform’s effectiveness and plan for national integration. These activities align with three core components of the LHS model: converting data into knowledge, translating knowledge into practice, and feeding implementation process and outcome data back into the system for continuous learning. The platform will be underpinned by strong ethical and governance frameworks to ensure data privacy, transparency, and responsible AI use. Discussion ImpleMATE aims to transform the adoption of evidence-based innovations in healthcare by embedding trustworthy AI into the core of implementation practice. Through the integration of structured ontologies, real-time AI reasoning, and an interactive user interface, the platform will provide tailored solutions to support implementation efforts. Designed as a dynamic learning system, ImpleMATE will evolve with user input and real-world data, offering a scalable, ethically grounded solution to accelerate and enhance implementation across healthcare settings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Identifying modifiable factors influencing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) risk is important for prevention. Blood biomarkers, particularly cholesterol, have been associated with neurodegenerative risk, but findings in ALS are inconsistent, and data on FTD are limited.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using UK primary care records from QResearch linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Adults with biomarker data recorded between 1998 and 2023 were included. We examined associations of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, creatine kinase, and HbA1c with ALS and FTD risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was applied to explore genetically predicted associations of selected biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were up to 2,695 ALS and 781 FTD diagnoses, with a median follow-up duration of 9.4 and 10.5 years, respectively. Higher LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR]<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.11) and total cholesterol levels (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02–1.10) were linearly associated with higher ALS risk. Age-stratified analysis showed a stronger association for total cholesterol in those ≥ 60 years (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04–1.13, P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.003). Higher creatinine was inversely associated with FTD risk (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83–0.97), supported by MR (odds ratio [OR] inverse variance weighted (<sub>IVW</sub>)<sub>, per 1-SD</sub> = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.56–0.96). HbA1c showed a U-shaped association with FTD (P<sub>non-linearity</sub> = 0.006).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LDL and total cholesterol may provide insights into early disease changes or the etiology of ALS, whereas creatinine and HbA1c may be relevant for FTD. Research in monogenic ALS and FTD is needed to determine whether these biomarkers inform targeted prevention or intervention strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>No direct demyelination was detected in the brains of <i>Slc20a2</i>-knockout brain calcification mice, but susceptibility to demyelination increased under the induction of oligodendrocyte-toxic cuprizone. The enhanced susceptibility was related to an exacerbation of brain calcification.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal brain calcium-phosphate (Ca-Pi) deposits along microvessels or inside neuronal cells. Eight genes have been linked to PFBC, with the <i>SLC20A2</i> being the earliest identified. <i>SLC20A2</i> encodes PiT-2, which is crucial for Pi homeostasis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In <i>Slc20a2</i> homozygous knockout (HO) mice, the neurotoxic effects resulting from pathological CSF-Pi accumulation and the unique brain transcriptome suggested that the absence of PiT-2 might lead to myelin abnormalities. However, the myelin morphology and content under <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency remained largely unknown, and these were quantitatively investigated in this study. The results indicated no direct demyelination in the brains of <i>Slc20a2</i>-HO mice, but an increased susceptibility to demyelination under the induction of oligodendrocyte-toxic cuprizone (CPZ). The enhanced susceptibility was related to a greater infiltration of Th17 cells in the brain parenchyma, accompanying an exacerbation of brain calcification in <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency.</p>

     alt="Newborn Auditory Brainstem Response and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"/>
<p>Newborns who later died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) appeared to show greater variability in auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at birth; however, these differences may reflect data quality rather than true physiological abnormalities, and expert-rated analyses did not replicate the finding. Further research is needed to clarify any link between ABR patterns and SIDS risk.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt; 1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesized that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. We integrated two secondary datasets and examined ABRs of newborns who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = 11) compared to a normative sample (<i>n</i> = 198,990), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. As hypothesized, infants who died from SIDS were more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Children who died of SIDS appeared to have shorter latencies to the trough that follows peak V in the left ear than children without SIDS. However, our expert-rated data failed to replicate this finding, suggesting it is unlikely to reflect a true effect. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

     alt="Evolution of Axonal Injury in the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration in Adult Ferrets"/>
<p>A clinically relevant ferret model of concussion was established using the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration. This model reproduced key features of diffuse axonal injury, including disrupted axonal transport, neurofilament pathology, and persistent disruption of the nodes of Ranvier, alongside motor and cognitive deficits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Concussion-related symptoms, such as impaired balance, slower processing speed, attention deficits, memory dysfunction, and irritability, are thought to result from diffuse axonal injury (DAI), characterized by selective damage to white matter axons. Axons subjected to this mechanical stretch injury exhibit diverse pathological changes, including disruption of axonal transport, neurofilament compaction and degradation, myelin sheath disruption, and loss of sodium channels required for action potential generation and propagation. These distinct forms of axonal pathology may evolve differentially over time and preferentially localize to specific white matter tracts. In this study, we employed the clinically relevant ferret model of concussion using the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA). 55 male ferrets were randomly allocated to sham or injury groups and then to either 24 h, 72 h, or 14d survival time points. We confirmed that axonal transport disruption and neurofilament pathology represent independent processes, with minimal colocalization but a shared peak of around 72 h following injury. Furthermore, we observed a persistent loss of ankyrin-G, a critical anchoring protein for sodium channels at the node of Ranvier, up to 14d postinjury, suggesting that the resultant impairment in axonal transmission may underlie many concussion symptoms. Indeed, injured ferrets displayed significant deficits in balance, working memory, spatial memory, and recognition memory. These findings demonstrate that the CHIMERA model in ferrets recapitulates key axonal pathologies and their associated clinical manifestations following concussion. This model offers a valuable platform for investigating the temporal evolution of axonal injury and developing targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate concussion-related deficits.</p>
