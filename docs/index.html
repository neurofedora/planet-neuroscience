              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Signatures of Actively Controlled Self-Motion and the Subjective Encoding of Distance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Navigating through an environment requires knowledge about one&rsquo;s direction of self-motion (heading) and traveled distance. Behavioral studies showed that human participants can actively reproduce a previously observed travel distance purely based on visual information. Here, we employed electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the underlying neural processes. We measured, in human observers, event-related potentials (ERPs) during visually simulated straight-forward self-motion across a ground plane. The participants&rsquo; task was to reproduce (active condition) double the distance of a previously seen self-displacement (passive condition) using a gamepad. We recorded the trajectories of self-motion during the active condition and played it back to the participants in a third set of trials (replay condition). We analyzed EEG activity separately for four electrode clusters: frontal (F), central (C), parietal (P), and occipital (O). When aligned to self-motion onset or offset, response modulation of the ERPs was stronger, and several ERP components had different latencies in the passive as compared with the active condition. This result is in line with the concept of predictive coding, which implies modified neural activation for self-induced versus externally induced sensory stimulation. We aligned our data also to the times when subjects passed the (objective) single distance d_obj and the (subjective) single distance d_sub. Remarkably, wavelet-based temporal-frequency analyses revealed enhanced theta-band activation for F, P, and O-clusters shortly before passing d_sub. This enhanced activation could be indicative of a navigation related representation of subjective distance. More generally, our study design allows to investigate subjective perception without interfering neural activation because of the required response action.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Coordinating the four limbs is an important feature of terrestrial mammalian locomotion. When the foot dorsum contacts an obstacle, cutaneous mechanoreceptors send afferent signals to the spinal cord to elicit coordinated reflex responses in the four limbs to ensure dynamic balance and forward progression. To determine how the locomotor pattern of all four limbs changes in response to a sensory perturbation evoked by activating cutaneous afferents from one hindlimb, we electrically stimulated the superficial peroneal (SP) nerve with a relatively long train at four different phases (mid-stance, stance-to-swing transition, mid-swing, and swing-to-stance transition) of the hindlimb cycle in seven adult cats. The largest functional effects of the stimulation were found at mid-swing and at the stance-to-swing transition with several changes in the ipsilateral hindlimb, such as increased activity in muscles that flex the knee and hip joints, increased joint flexion and toe height, increased stride/step lengths and increased swing duration. We also observed several changes in support periods to shift support from the stimulated hindlimb to the other three limbs. The same stimulation applied at mid-stance and the swing-to-stance transition produced more subtle changes in the pattern. We observed no changes in stride and step lengths in the ipsilateral hindlimb with stimulation in these phases. We did observe some slightly greater flexions at the knee and ankle joints with stimulation at mid-stance and a reduction in double support periods and increase in triple support. Our results show that correcting or preventing stumbling involves functional contributions from all four limbs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Increase in Tau Pathology in P290S Mapt Knock-In Mice Crossed with AppNL-G-F Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease (AD) is characterized by the pathologic assembly of amyloid &beta; (A&beta;) peptide, which deposits into extracellular plaques, and tau, which accumulates in intraneuronal inclusions. To investigate the link between A&beta; and tau pathologies, experimental models featuring both pathologies are needed. We developed a mouse model featuring both tau and A&beta; pathologies by knocking the P290S mutation into murine <I>Mapt</I> and crossing these <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> knock-in (KI) mice with the <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup> KI line. <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice developed a small number of tau inclusions, which increased with age. The amount of tau pathology was significantly larger in <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice from 18 months of age onward. Tau pathology was higher in limbic areas, including hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform/entorhinal cortex. We also observed AT100-positive and Gallyas-Braak-silver-positive dystrophic neurites containing assembled filamentous tau, as visualized by <I>in situ</I> electron microscopy. Using a cell-based tau seeding assay, we showed that Sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts from both 18-month-old <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI and <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice were seed competent, with brain extracts from double-KI mice seeding significantly more than those from the <I>Mapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice. Finally, we showed that <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice had neurodegeneration in the piriform cortex from 18 months of age. We suggest that <I>App</I><sup>NL-G-F</sup><I>xMapt</I><sup>P290S</sup> KI mice provide a good model for studying the interactions of aggregation-prone tau, A&beta;, neuritic plaques, neurodegeneration, and aging.</p>

                Background A photovoltaic (PV) system, especially the stand-alone type, along with a battery storage system, plays a significant role in providing the needed electrical energy to remote, off-grid communities. Methods  In this study, a stand-alone PV solar cell was enhanced to better understand the system operation. Modeling and simulation were performed using MATLAB software. Results  This work has shown that the I-V  (current-voltage) and P-V (power-voltage) characteristics of the modelled system have a profound effect on energy when a pulse width modulation controller is used as a charger. The modelled PV system generated the required energy under different conditions, considering temperature and PV battery voltage mismatches. Conclusion In summary, the simulated model in this study can be considered a system capable of detecting different conditions with the presence or absence of light at different temperatures. Finally, monitoring the temperatures, adjusting the voltage with a suitable charger controller, and selecting solar modules made of optimal materials can increase the efficiency of the solar system and allow it to be used in more applications.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Review of individualized current flow modeling studies for transcranial electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is substantial intersubject variability of behavioral and neurophysiological responses to transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), which represents one of the most important limitations of tES. Many tES protocols utilize a fixed experimental parameter set disregarding individual anatomical and physiological properties. This one-size-fits-all approach might be one reason for the observed interindividual response variability. Simulation of current flow applying head models based on available anatomical data can help to individualize stimulation parameters and contribute to the understanding of the causes of this response variability. Current flow modeling can be used to retrospectively investigate the characteristics of tES effectivity. Previous studies examined, for example, the impact of skull defects and lesions on the modulation of current flow and demonstrated effective stimulation intensities in different age groups. Furthermore, uncertainty analysis of electrical conductivities in current flow modeling indicated the most influential tissue compartments. Current flow modeling, when used in prospective study planning, can potentially guide stimulation configurations resulting in individually effective tES. Specifically, current flow modeling using individual or matched head models can be employed by clinicians and scientists to, for example, plan dosage in tES protocols for individuals or groups of participants. We review studies that show a relationship between the presence of behavioral/neurophysiological responses and features derived from individualized current flow models. We highlight the potential benefits of individualized current flow modeling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">BOREALIS: an R/Bioconductor package to detect outlier methylation from bisulfite sequencing data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rare genetic disease studies have benefited from the era of high throughput sequencing. DNA sequencing results in genetic diagnosis of 18-40% of previously unsolved cases, while the incorporation of RNA-Seq analysis has more recently been shown to generate significant numbers of previously unattainable diagnoses.  While DNA methylation remains less explored, multiple inborn diseases resulting from disorders of genomic imprinting are well characterized and a growing body of literature suggests the causative or correlative role of aberrant methylation in diverse rare inherited conditions.  Complex pictures of methylation patterning are also emerging, including the association of regional, multiple specific-site or even single-site methylation, with disease. The systematic application of genomic-wide methylation-based sequencing for undiagnosed cases of rare diseases is a logical progression from current testing paradigms.  Similar to the rationale previously exploited in RNA-based rare disease studies, we can assume that disease-associated or causative methylation aberrations in an individual will demonstrate significant differences from other individuals with unrelated phenotypes.  Thus, aberrantly methylated sites will be outliers from a heterogeneous cohort of individuals. Methods: Based on this rationale, we present BOREALIS: Bisulfite-seq OutlieR MEthylation At SingLeSIte ReSolution.  BOREALIS uses a beta binomial model to identify outlier methylation at single CpG site resolution from bisulfite sequencing data. Results: Utilizing power analyses, we demonstrate that BOREALIS can identify outlier CpG methylation within a cohort of samples.  Furthermore, we show that BOREALIS is tolerant to the inclusion of multiple identical outliers with sufficient cohort size and sequencing depth. Conclusions: The method demonstrates improved performance versus standard statistical testing and is suited for single or multi-site downstream analysis.

                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Improved visualization of high-dimensional data using the distance-of-distance transformation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jinke Liu, Martin Vinck</p>

Dimensionality reduction tools like t-SNE and UMAP are widely used for high-dimensional data analysis. For instance, these tools are applied in biology to describe spiking patterns of neuronal populations or the genetic profiles of different cell types. Here, we show that when data include noise points that are randomly scattered within a high-dimensional space, a “scattering noise problem” occurs in the low-dimensional embedding where noise points overlap with the cluster points. We show that a simple transformation of the original distance matrix by computing a distance between neighbor distances alleviates this problem and identifies the noise points as a separate cluster. We apply this technique to high-dimensional neuronal spike sequences, as well as the representations of natural images by convolutional neural network units, and find an improvement in the constructed low-dimensional embedding. Thus, we present an improved dimensionality reduction technique for high-dimensional data containing noise points.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mathematical model of potassium homeostasis: Effect of feedforward and feedback controls</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melissa M. Stadt, Jessica Leete, Sophia Devinyak, Anita T. Layton</p>

Maintaining normal potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) concentrations in the extra- and intracellular fluid is critical for cell function. K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is achieved by ensuring proper distribution between extra- and intracellular fluid compartments and by matching K<sup>+</sup> excretion with intake. The Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump facilitates K<sup>+</sup> uptake into the skeletal muscle, where most K<sup>+</sup> is stored. Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity is stimulated by insulin and aldosterone. The kidneys regulate long term K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis by controlling the amount of K<sup>+</sup> excreted through urine. Renal handling of K<sup>+</sup> is mediated by a number of regulatory mechanisms, including an aldosterone-mediated feedback control, in which high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration stimulates aldosterone secretion, which enhances urine K<sup>+</sup> excretion, and a gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, in which dietary K<sup>+</sup> intake increases K<sup>+</sup> excretion. Recently, a muscle-kidney cross talk signal has been hypothesized, where the K<sup>+</sup> concentration in skeletal muscle cells directly affects urine K<sup>+</sup> excretion without changes in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration. To understand how these mechanisms coordinate under different K<sup>+</sup> challenges, we have developed a compartmental model of whole-body K<sup>+</sup> regulation. The model represents the intra- and extracellular fluid compartments in a human (male) as well as a detailed kidney compartment. We included (i) the gastrointestinal feedforward control mechanism, (ii) the effect of insulin and (iii) aldosterone on Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase K<sup>+</sup> uptake, and (iv) aldosterone stimulation of renal K<sup>+</sup> secretion. We used this model to investigate the impact of regulatory mechanisms on K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. Model predictions showed how the regulatory mechanisms synthesize to ensure that the extra- and intracelluller fluid K<sup>+</sup> concentrations remain in normal range in times of K<sup>+</sup> loading and fasting. Additionally, we predict that without the hypothesized muscle-kidney cross talk signal, the model was unable to predict a return to normal extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration after a period of high K<sup>+</sup> loading or depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Rapid and predictable genome evolution across three hybrid ant populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Nouhaud, Simon H. Martin, Beatriz Portinha, Vitor C. Sousa, Jonna Kulmuni</p>

Hybridization is frequent in the wild but it is unclear when admixture events lead to predictable outcomes and if so, at what timescale. We show that selection led to correlated sorting of genetic variation rapidly after admixture in 3 hybrid <i>Formica aquilonia</i> × <i>F</i>. <i>polyctena</i> ant populations. Removal of ancestry from the species with the lowest effective population size happened in all populations, consistent with purging of deleterious load. This process was modulated by recombination rate variation and the density of functional sites. Moreover, haplotypes with signatures of positive selection in either species were more likely to fix in hybrids. These mechanisms led to mosaic genomes with comparable ancestry proportions. Our work demonstrates predictable evolution over short timescales after admixture in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Data Note: COVID-19, social distancing, and pipeline vandalism in Nigeria [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                We present a dataset of the monthly cases of pipeline vandalism in Nigeria from January 2015 to January 2021. Data used in this study were collated from the Monthly Financial and Operations Reports (MFOR) of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Each MFOR provides cases of pipeline vandalism during a 12-month span from five key locations; Mosimi, Kaduna, Port Harcourt, Warri, and Gombe. Recorded incidences of pipeline vandalism from these locations were summed and assembled into five groups; namely: historical data, prior-COVID-19, COVID-19 lockdown, and post-COVID-19 lockdown. The data were grouped based on dates. These dates were January 2015 to July 2019, August 2019 to January 2020, February 2020 to July 2020, and August 2020 to January 2021 respectively. The historical data were further sub-divided into four sub-groups based on the deployment (May 2016) of sophisticated weapons, satellite imagery, and geographical information system into the security apparatus to checkmate pipeline vandalism. The four sub-groups are sub-group A (one-year before deployment), sub-group B (the year of deployment), sub-group C (one-year after deployment), and sub-group D (two-years after deployment). The dates span for each sub-group is May 2015-April 2016, May 2016-April 2017, May 2017-April 2018, and May 2018-April 2019 respectively. After the deployment of GIS devices in May 2016, the accumulated national number of pipeline vandalism cases declined from 400 cases in January 2016 to 293 in February 2016, and 259 cases in March 2016 as opposed to 60, 49, and 94 cases in the same months in 2017; but over the years, 2017 to 2021 these methods have proved less effective, and cases of pipeline vandalism have risen once more. Similar changes in the number of cases and patterns were observed during the COVID-19 movement restrictions. From the dataset, it can be seen that COVID-19 influenced incidences of pipeline vandalism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Rehabilitation of bilateral below-knee and partial-hand amputations in a developing country [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Limb ischemia is a complication of peripheral artery disease (PAD)which can lead to amputation. Amputation occurs in approximately 3-4% of PAD patients. In Indonesia, post-amputation patients are only hospitalized for the acute phase and the post-amputation rehabilitation programs must be done as an outpatient. This could be a barrier to the continuity of rehabilitation programs. A solution is the application of home-based rehabilitation programs. A 57-year-old female was referred from the Cardiothoracic Surgery Outpatient Clinic post-amputation with bilateral below-knees and partial-hands amputation after being diagnosed with PAD. On initial examination, all her elbows, wrists, thumbs, hips, and knees showed weakness. The patient received neuromuscular electrical stimulations (NMES) as well as a home-based rehabilitation programs. On the second examination, after considering the data from the clinical finding and supporting examination, the patient received bilateral below-knee prostheses and bilateral functional partial-hand prostheses, created using 3D printing technology with polylactic acid material. After a few months, she was able to do most of her activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, work as a shopkeeper in her store, and feel more confident interacting with others. A comprehensive rehabilitation programs, patient adherence to exercise, and caregiver support are critical to improving functional capacity and the quality of life in a patient with bilateral below-knee and bilateral partial-hand amputation caused by PAD.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Pro-prion, as a membrane adaptor protein for E3 ligase c-Cbl, facilitates the ubiquitination of IGF-1R, promoting melanoma metastasis</a></h4>

              
                The pro-prion (pro-PrP) is a defective isoform, processed as transmembrane protein instead of being GPI anchored. Li et al. find that PrP is upregulated in melanoma and pro-PrP tethers the E3 ligase c-Cbl to ubiquitinate and degrade IGF-1-activated IGF-1R, leading to enhanced autophagy and melanoma aggressiveness. Disrupting pro-PrP/c-Cbl binding reduces metastasis.

                In this study, Tan et al. provide mechanistic insights on how the Sag-Shoc2 axis specifies the fate of pancreatic tumor by converting mPanINs to neoplastic cystic lesions during KrasG12D-induced tumorigenesis. SAG is an E3 ligase that promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of SHOC2 and DEPTOR, thus modulating the RAS/RAF and mTORC1 signal pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opposite polarity programs regulate asymmetric subsidiary cell divisions in grasses</a></h4>

              
                Grass stomata recruit lateral subsidiary cells (SCs), which are key to the unique stomatal morphology and the efficient plant-atmosphere gas exchange in grasses. Subsidiary mother cells (SMCs) strongly polarise before an asymmetric division forms a SC. Yet apart from a proximal polarity module that includes PANGLOSS1 (PAN1) and guides nuclear migration, little is known regarding the developmental processes that form SCs. Here, we used comparative transcriptomics of developing wild-type and SC-less <i>bdmute</i> leaves in the genetic model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> to identify novel factors involved in SC formation. This approach revealed BdPOLAR, which forms a novel, distal polarity domain in SMCs that is opposite to the proximal PAN1 domain. Both polarity domains are required for the formative SC division yet exhibit various roles in guiding pre-mitotic nuclear migration and SMC division plane orientation, respectively. Nonetheless, the domains are linked as the proximal domain controls polarisation of the distal domain. In summary, we identified two opposing polarity domains that coordinate the SC division, a process crucial for grass stomatal physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cross-talk between red blood cells and plasma influences blood flow and omics phenotypes in severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can affect multiple organs, among which is the circulatory system. Inflammation and mortality risk markers were previously detected in COVID-19 plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) metabolic and proteomic profiles. Additionally, biophysical properties, such as deformability, were found to be changed during the infection. Based on such data, we aim to better characterize RBC functions in COVID-19. We evaluate the flow properties of RBCs in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by using microfluidic techniques and automated methods, including artificial neural networks, for an unbiased RBC analysis. We find strong flow and RBC shape impairment in COVID-19 samples and demonstrate that such changes are reversible upon suspension of COVID-19 RBCs in healthy plasma. Vice versa, healthy RBCs resemble COVID-19 RBCs when suspended in COVID-19 plasma. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses allow us to detect the effect of plasma exchanges on both plasma and RBCs and demonstrate a new role of RBCs in maintaining plasma equilibria at the expense of their flow properties. Our findings provide a framework for further investigations of clinical relevance for therapies against COVID-19 and possibly other infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neurovascular anatomy of dwarf dinosaur implies precociality in sauropods</a></h4>

              
                Macronaria, a group of mostly colossal sauropod dinosaurs, comprised the largest terrestrial vertebrates of Earth’s history. However, some of the smallest sauropods belong to this group as well. The Late Jurassic macronarian island dwarf <i>Europasaurus holgeri</i> is one of the most peculiar and best-studied sauropods worldwide. So far, the braincase material of this taxon from Germany pended greater attention. With the aid of micro-computed tomography (microCT), we report on the neuroanatomy of the nearly complete braincase of an adult individual, as well as the inner ears (endosseous labyrinths) of one other adult and several juveniles (the latter also containing novel vascular cavities). The presence of large and morphologically adult inner ears in juvenile material suggests precociality. Our findings add to the diversity of neurovascular anatomy in sauropod braincases and buttress the perception of sauropods as fast-growing and autonomous giants with manifold facets of reproductive and social behaviour. This suggests that – apart from sheer size – little separated <i>Europasaurus</i> from its large-bodied relatives.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling the spatiotemporal spread of beneficial alleles using ancient genomes</a></h4>

              
                Ancient genome sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to study natural selection in unprecedented detail. Rather than making inferences from indirect footprints left by selection in present-day genomes, we can directly observe whether a given allele was present or absent in a particular region of the world at almost any period of human history within the last 10,000 years. Methods for studying selection using ancient genomes often rely on partitioning individuals into discrete time periods or regions of the world. However, a complete understanding of natural selection requires more nuanced statistical methods which can explicitly model allele frequency changes in a continuum across space and time. Here we introduce a method for inferring the spread of a beneficial allele across a landscape using two-dimensional partial differential equations. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can handle time-stamped ancient samples, as well as genotype likelihoods and pseudohaploid sequences from low-coverage genomes. We apply the method to a panel of published ancient West Eurasian genomes to produce dynamic maps showcasing the inferred spread of candidate beneficial alleles over time and space. We also provide estimates for the strength of selection and diffusion rate for each of these alleles. Finally, we highlight possible avenues of improvement for accurately tracing the spread of beneficial alleles in more complex scenarios.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thalamocortical contribution to cognitive task activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical interaction is a ubiquitous functional motif in the mammalian brain. Previously (Hwang et al., 2021), we reported that lesions to network hubs in the human thalamus are associated with multi-domain behavioral impairments in language, memory, and executive functions. Here we show how task-evoked thalamic activity are organized to support these broad cognitive abilities. We analyzed functional MRI data from human subjects that performed 127 tasks encompassing a broad range of cognitive representations. We first investigated the spatial organization of task-evoked activity and found a basis set of activity patterns evoked to support processing needs of each task. Specifically, the anterior, medial, and posterior-medial thalamus exhibit hub-like activity profiles that are suggestive of broad functional participation. These thalamic task hubs overlapped with network hubs interlinking cortical systems. To further determine the cognitive relevance of thalamic activity and thalamocortical functional connectivity, we built a data-driven thalamocortical model to test whether thalamic activity can be used to predict cortical task activity. The thalamocortical model predicted task-specific cortical activity patterns, and outperformed comparison models built on cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. Simulated lesions to low-dimensional, multi-task thalamic hub regions impaired task activity prediction. This simulation result was further supported by profiles of neuropsychological impairments in human patients with focal thalamic lesions. In summary, our results suggest a general organizational principle of how the human thalamocortical system supports cognitive task activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mini-IDLE 3D biomimetic culture assay enables interrogation of mechanisms governing muscle stem cell quiescence and niche repopulation</a></h4>

              
                Adult skeletal muscle harbors a population of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) that are required to repair or reform multinucleated myofibers after tissue injury. In youth, MuSCs return to a reversible state of cell cycle arrest termed 'quiescence' after injury resolution. By contrast, a proportion of MuSCs in aged muscle remain in a semi-activated state, causing a premature response to subsequent injury cues that results in incomplete tissue repair and eventual stem cell depletion. Regulation of the balance between MuSC quiescence and activation in youth and in age may hold the key to restoring tissue homeostasis with age, but is incompletely understood. To fill this gap, we developed a simple and tractable <i>in vitro</i> method, with a 96-well footprint, to rapidly inactivate MuSCs freshly isolated from young murine skeletal muscle tissue, and return them to a quiescent-like state for at least one-week, which we name mini-IDLE (Inactivation and Dormancy LEveraged <i>in vitro</i>). This was achieved by introducing MuSCs into a three-dimensional (3D) bioartificial niche comprised of a thin sheet of multinucleated mouse myotubes, which we iterate, and analyze temporally, to show that these <i>in vivo</i> niche features provide the minimal cues necessary to inactivate MuSCs and induce quiescence. By seeding the 3D myotube sheets with different starting numbers of MuSCs, the assay revealed cellular heterogeneity and population-level adaptation activities that converged on a common steady-state niche repopulation density; behaviors previously observed only <i>in vivo</i>. Quiescence-associated hallmarks included a Pax7<sup>+</sup>CalcR<sup>+</sup>DDX6<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup>c-FOS<sup>-</sup> molecular signature, <i>in vivo</i> quiescent-like morphologies including oval-shaped nuclei and long cytoplasmic projections with N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> tips, as well as the acquisition of polarized niche markers. Leveraging high-content imaging and bespoke CellProfiler<sup>TM</sup>-based image analysis pipelines, we demonstrate a relationship between morphology and cell fate signatures opening up the possibility of real-time morphology-based screening. When MuSCs from aged muscle were introduced into the assay, they displayed aberrant proliferative activities, delayed inactivation kinetics, persistence of activation-associated morphologies, and population depletion; quiescence-associated defects that we show are rescued by wortmannin treatment. Thus, the miniaturized assay offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate long-standing queries in areas such as regulation of adult stem cell pool size and functional heterogeneity within the MuSC population, and to uncover regulators of quiescence in youth and in age.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vocal communication is tied to interpersonal arousal coupling in caregiver-infant dyads</a></h4>

              
                It has been argued that a necessary condition for the emergence of speech in humans is the ability to vocalize irrespectively of underlying affective states, but when and how this happens during development remains unclear. To examine this, we used wearable microphones and autonomic sensors to collect multimodal naturalistic datasets from 12-month-olds and their caregivers. We observed that, across the day, clusters of vocalisations occur during elevated infant and caregiver arousal. This relationship is stronger in infants than caregivers: caregivers vocalizations show greater decoupling with their own states of arousal, and their vocal production is more influenced by the infant's arousal than their own. Different types of vocalisation elicit different patterns of change across the dyad. Cries occur following reduced infant arousal stability and lead to increased child-caregiver arousal coupling, and decreased infant arousal. Speech-like vocalisations also occur at elevated arousal, but lead to longer-lasting increases in arousal, and elicit more parental verbal responses. Our results suggest that: 12-month-old infants' vocalisations are strongly contingent on their arousal state (for both cries and speech-like vocalisations), whereas adults' vocalisations are more flexibly tied to their own arousal; that cries and speech-like vocalisations alter the intra-dyadic dynamics of arousal in different ways, which may be an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Shifting the focus of zebrafish toward a model of the tumor microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Cancer cells exist in a complex ecosystem with numerous other cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The composition of this tumor/TME ecosystem will vary at each anatomic site and affects phenotypes such as initiation, metastasis, and drug resistance. A mechanistic understanding of the large number of cell-cell interactions between tumor and TME requires models that allow us to both characterize as well as genetically perturb this complexity. Zebrafish are a model system optimized for this problem, because of the large number of existing cell-type-specific drivers that can label nearly any cell in the TME. These include stromal cells, immune cells, and tissue resident normal cells. These cell-type-specific promoters/enhancers can be used to drive fluorophores to facilitate imaging and also CRISPR cassettes to facilitate perturbations. A major advantage of the zebrafish is the ease by which large numbers of TME cell types can be studied at once, within the same animal. While these features make the zebrafish well suited to investigate the TME, the model has important limitations, which we also discuss. In this review, we describe the existing toolset for studying the TME using zebrafish models of cancer and highlight unique biological insights that can be gained by leveraging this powerful resource.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Desmosomal connectomics of all somatic muscles in an annelid larva</a></h4>

              
                Cells form networks in animal tissues through synaptic, chemical and adhesive links. Invertebrate muscle cells often connect to other cells through desmosomes, adhesive junctions anchored by intermediate filaments. To study desmosomal networks, we skeletonised 853 muscle cells and their desmosomal partners in volume electron microscopy data covering an entire larva of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i>. Muscle cells adhere to each other, to epithelial, glial, ciliated, and bristle-producing cells and to the basal lamina, forming a desmosomal connectome of over 2,000 cells. The aciculae - chitin rods that form an endoskeleton in the segmental appendages - are highly connected hubs in this network. This agrees with the many degrees of freedom of their movement, as revealed by video microscopy. Mapping motoneuron synapses to the desmosomal connectome allowed us to infer the extent of tissue influenced by motoneurons. Our work shows how cellular-level maps of synaptic and adherent force networks can elucidate body mechanics.

                Previous work has suggested unitized pairs behave as a single unit and more critically, are processed neurally different than those of associative memories. The current works examines the neural differences between unitization and associative memory using fMRI and multivoxel analyses. Specifically, we examined the differences across face-occupation pairings as a function of whether the pairing was viewed as a person performing the given job (unitized binding) or a person saying they knew someone who had a particular job (associative binding). The results show that at encoding, the angular gyrus can discriminate between unitized and associative target trials. Additionally, during encoding, the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus and perirhinal cortex), frontal parietal regions (angular gyrus and medial frontal gyrus) and visual regions (middle occipital cortex) exhibit distinct neural patterns to recollected unitized and associative targets. Furthermore, the medial frontal gyrus and middle occipital cortex show greater neural similarity for recollected unitized trials than those of recollected associative trials. We conclude that visually unitized pairs may enhance unitization in older adults due to greater similarity of trials within the same condition during the encoding process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Walking bumblebees see faster</a></h4>

              
                The behavioral state of an animal has profound effects on neuronal information processing. Locomotion changes the response properties of visual interneurons in the insect brain, but it is still unknown if it also alters the response properties of photoreceptors. Photoreceptor responses become faster at higher temperatures. It has therefore been suggested that thermoregulation in bees and other insects could improve temporal resolution in vision, but direct evidence for this idea has so far been missing. Here we compared electroretinograms (ERGs) from the compound eyes of tethered bumblebees that were either sitting still or were walking on an air supported ball. We found that the visual processing speed strongly increased when the bumblebees were walking. By monitoring the bumblebees' eye temperature during our recordings, we saw that the increase in response speed was in synchrony with a rise of the eye temperature. By artificially heating the bee's head, we show that the walking induced temperature increase of the visual system is sufficient to explain the rise in processing speed. We also show that walking accelerates the visual system to the equivalent of a 14-fold increase in light intensity. We conclude that the walking-induced rise in temperature accelerates the processing of visual information in bumblebees, which is an ideal strategy to process the increased information flow during locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switching between external and internal attention in hippocampal networks</a></h4>

              
                Everyday experience requires processing external signals from the world around us and internal information retrieved from memory. To do both, the brain must fluctuate between states that are optimized for external vs. internal attention. Here, we focus on the hippocampus as a region that may serve at the interface between these forms of attention, and ask how it switches between prioritizing sensory signals from the external world vs. internal signals related to memories and thoughts. Pharmacological, computational, and animal studies have identified input from the cholinergic basal forebrain as important for biasing the hippocampus towards processing external information, whereas complementary research has suggested the dorsal attention network (DAN) may aid in allocating attentional resources towards accessing internal information. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the basal forebrain and DAN drive the hippocampus towards external and internal attention, respectively. We used data from 29 human participants (17 female) who completed 2 attention tasks during fMRI. One task primarily required external attention ("explicitly instructed" task); the other required switching between external and internal attention ("memory-guided" task). We discovered that background connectivity between the basal forebrain and hippocampus was stronger during the explicitly instructed vs. memory-guided task. In contrast, DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was stronger during the memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed task. Finally, the strength of DAN-hippocampus connectivity correlated with performance on the memory-guided but not explicitly instructed task. Together, these results provide evidence that the hippocampus may switch between external and internal states by preferentially communicating with the basal forebrain and DAN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shared neural codes of recognition memory</a></h4>

              
                Research on recognition memory has identified several electrophysiological indicators of successful memory retrieval, known as old-new effects. These effects have been observed in different sensory domains using various stimulus types, but little attention has been given to their similarity or distinctiveness and the underlying processes they share. Dual process theories of memory retrieval have linked the early mid-frontal effect to familiarity and the late parietal component to recollection. Here, a data-driven approach was taken to investigate the temporal evolution of shared information content between different memory conditions using openly available EEG data from healthy human participants of both sexes, taken from six experiments. A test dataset involving personally highly familiar and unfamiliar faces was used. The results show that neural familiarity signals for face stimuli were highly generalized starting from around 200 ms following stimulus onset. When training was performed on non-face datasets, an early (around 200-300 ms) to late (post-400 ms) differentiation was observed over most regions of interest. Successful cross-classification for non-face stimuli (music and object/scene associations) was most pronounced in late period. Additionally, a striking dissociation was observed between familiar and remembered objects, with shared signals present only in the late window for correctly remembered objects, while cross-classification for familiar objects was successful in the early period as well. These findings suggest that late neural signals of memory retrieval generalize across sensory modalities and stimulus types, and the dissociation between familiar and remembered objects may provide insight into the underlying processes.

                Aging is due to a complex decline of multiple biological processes. Some of the causes include oxidative damage, mitochondrial and proteostatic dysfunction and DNA damage. This results in deterioration as biological systems age. This age-related decline is well quantified, and experienced, for human hearing and is presumed to be due to a decrease in the ears metabolism; specifically a decrease in ability to maintain an electrochemical gradient, the endocochlear potential. However, direct measurements of metabolism across a lifespan in an auditory system are lacking. Even if metabolism does decrease with age is it a cause of age-related auditory decline or simply correlative? All auditory systems across the animal kingdom share functional principles including ion pumping cells, auditory receptors, spiking auditory nerves and multiple supporting cells. Therefore, we used an insect, the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, as a physiologically versatile model to understand how cellular metabolism correlates with age and impacts on age-related auditory decline. We found that although metabolism correlates with age-related auditory decline it is not causative.

                Ample evidence shows that humans violate fundamental economic axioms. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying inconsistent (or irrational) choices remains obscure. Here, we aim to show that inconsistent choices could rise either due to value miscalculations or due to motor errors during task execution. We report the results from two independent behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Subjects completed a risky-choice task to test their inconsistency levels, followed by two novel tasks, designed to solely examine motor output. We recorded mouse trajectories during task execution and designed 34 features to analyze choice dynamics. We show that choice dynamics predict inconsistency levels, even when motor output was absent any valuation elements. In the neuroimaging study, we show that inconsistency is tied to noisy value computations in reward circuits, but at the same time, is also related to noisy neural motor dynamics. These findings suggest that (at least) two neural sources of noise contribute to inconsistent choice behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative modeling of the emergence of macroscopic grid-like representations</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that play a key role in spatial navigation. When subjects navigate through spatial environments, grid cells exhibit firing fields that are arranged in a triangular grid pattern. As direct recordings of grid cells from the human brain are only rarely possible, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies proposed and described an indirect measure of entorhinal grid-cell activity, which is quantified as a hexadirectional modulation of fMRI activity as a function of the subject's movement direction. However, it still remains unclear how the activity of single grid cells is related to the sum activity of a population of grid cells, which may exhibit hexadirectional modulation and thus provide the basis for the hexadirectional modulation of entorhinal cortex activity measured with fMRI. Here, we thus performed numerical simulations and analytical calculations to better understand how the aggregated activity of many grid cells may be hexadirectionally modulated. Our simulations implemented three different hypotheses proposing that the hexadirectional modulation occurs because grid cells show head-direction tuning aligned with the grid axes; are subjected to repetition suppression; or exhibit a bias towards a particular grid phase offset. Our simulations demonstrate that all three hypotheses can, in principle, lead to a hexadirectional modulation of sum grid-cell activity. However, the magnitude of the hexadirectional modulation appears to depend considerably on the subject's navigation pattern and the exact biological properties of grid cells. Our results thus indicate that future fMRI studies could be designed to test which of the three hypotheses most likely accounts for the fMRI measure of grid cells. These findings also underline the importance of quantifying the biological properties of single grid cells in humans to further elucidate how hexadirectional modulations of fMRI activity may emerge.

                After a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), the neural network activates a reparative response seeking to restore homeostasis. Astrocyte reactivation is an essential component of this response. The injury creates a temporal microenvironment where neurogenic signaling molecules regulate cell fate decisions of neocortical neural progenitors. Likewise, astrocyte reactivation triggers a transcriptional-proliferative program where neurogenic signaling molecules play crucial roles. However, precise molecular mechanisms are context-specific and are not fully understood. Here we studied cellular and molecular aspects of reactive astrocytes response after Notch-Wnt neurogenic signaling modulation. Our results provide new evidence of cortical Notch-Wnt signaling activation after TBI. Reactive astrocytes in the core of Notch signaling showed a differential aggregated distribution. In vitro, Notch inhibition promoted a neural precursor profile and might increase the number of cells committed in a proliferative response. Finally, we found an indirect co-regulation of Wnt-Shh signaling in BHLH-Notch target genes and a Notch-supportive effect in Wnt-Shh signaling activation.

                A plethora of daily motor tasks consist of sequences of movements or steps that need to be performed in a specific order. Yet, it remains unclear how the brain represents sequential motor actions in a way that preserves their temporal order. Here, we used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired during motor sequence practice to investigate whether the hippocampus, a brain region known to support temporal order in the non-motor memory domain, represents information about the temporal order of sequential motor actions. We also examined such representation in other regions of the motor network (i.e., the premotor cortex (PMC), supplementary motor area (SMA), anterior superior parietal lobule (aSPL) and striatum) known for their critical role in motor sequence learning. Our results show that hippocampal activation patterns carried information about movements in their learned temporal position in the sequence, but not about movements or positions in random movement patterns. A similar pattern of results was observed in the striatum. Our data also indicate that multivoxel patterns in M1, SMA and aSPL carried movement-based information while the PMC represented both movement- and position-based information. Altogether, our findings provide novel insight into the role of the hippocampus in the motor memory domain and point to its capacity to bind movements to their temporal position in a motor sequence. Our results also deepen our understanding of how striatal and cortical regions contribute to motor sequence learning via position and movement coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">pOpsicle: An all-optical reporter system for synaptic vesicle recycling combining pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins with optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins are widely used to study synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion and recycling. When targeted to the lumen of SVs, fluorescence of these proteins is quenched by the acidic pH. Following SV fusion, they are exposed to extracellular neutral pH, resulting in a fluorescence increase. SV fusion, recycling and acidification can thus be tracked by tagging integral SV proteins with pHsensitive proteins. Neurotransmission is generally stimulated by electrophysiology, which is not feasible in small, intact animals, thus limiting the approach to cell culture regimes. Previous in vivo approaches depended on distinct (sensory) stimuli, thus limiting the addressable neuron types. To overcome these limitations, we established an all-optical approach to stimulate and visualize SV fusion and recycling. We combined distinct pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (inserted into the SV protein synaptogyrin) and light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) for optical stimulation, overcoming optical crosstalk and thus enabling an all-optical approach. We generated two different variants of the pHsensitive optogenetic reporter of vesicle recycling (pOpsicle) and tested them in cholinergic neurons of intact Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. First, we combined the red fluorescent protein pHuji with the blue-light gated ChR2(H134R), and second, the green fluorescent pHluorin combined with the novel red-shifted ChR ChrimsonSA. In both cases, fluorescence increases were observed after optical stimulation. Increase and subsequent decline of fluorescence was affected by mutations of proteins involved in SV fusion and endocytosis. These results establish pOpsicle as a non-invasive, all-optical approach to investigate different steps of the SV cycle.

                The study of brain dynamics under normal or pathological conditions has proven to be a difficult task, there is no unified consensus on how it should be studied. In this article we present a methodology based on Transfer Entropy to characterize the information flow between different brain hemispheres in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states in healthy subjects, with an experimental setup that resembles the technical conditions found in a clinical setting. We have estimated the Transfer Entropy between the Hilbert phases of bandpass filtered EEG channels. We have designed a methodology to analyze the interhemispheric and intrahemispheric information flow in both conditions. Our results suggest an increased information transfer in the EC condition for the alpha, beta1 and beta2 frequency bands. Furthermore, we do not observe a preferred direction of interhemispheric information movement in both conditions. In conclusion, there is evidence of a significant difference in the brain's information transfer dynamics between EO and EC resting states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural, physiological and behavioral correlates of empathy for pain in Tourette syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Persons with Tourette syndrome (TS) show altered social behaviors, such as echophenomena and increased personal distress in emotional situations. These symptoms may reflect an overactive mirror neuron system (MNS), causing both increased automatic imitation and a stronger tendency to share others' emotions. To test this, we measured the individual level of echophenomena with a video protocol and experimentally induced empathy for pain in 25 participants with TS and 25 matched controls. In the empathy for pain paradigm, pictures of hands and feet in painful or neutral situations were presented, while we measured participants' EEG and skin conductance response (SCR). Changes in somatosensory mu suppression during the observation of the pictures, as well as pain ratings and SCR were compared between groups and correlated with the occurrence of echophenomena, self-reported empathy and clinical measures. Our TS sample showed significantly more echophenomena than controls, but the groups showed no behavioral differences in empathic abilities. However, controls, but not patients with TS, showed the predicted increased mu suppression when watching painful compared to neutral actions. While echophenomena were present in all persons with TS, the hypothesis of an overactive MNS in TS could not be substantiated. On the contrary, the TS group showed a noticeable lack of mu attenuation in response to pain stimuli, questioning the normal functioning of the MNS in empathy for pain situations. In conclusion, the MNS remains an important area of study for TS, but overactivity of the system could not explain echophenomena and social symptoms of TS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meningioma microstructure assessed by diffusion MRI: an investigation of the source of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy by quantitative histology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained with diffusion MRI (dMRI) have been associated with cell density and tissue anisotropy across tumors, but it is unknown whether these associations persist at the microscopic level. Purpose: To quantify the degree to which cell density (CD) and structure anisotropy (SA), as determined from histology, account for the intra-tumor variability of MD and FA in meningioma tumors. Furthermore, to clarify whether histological features other than cell density account for additional intra-tumor variability of MD. Materials and Methods: We performed ex-vivo dMRI at 200 m isotropic resolution and histological imaging on 16 excised meningioma tumor samples. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to map MD and FA, as well as the in-plane FA (FAIP). Histology images were analyzed in terms of cell nuclei density and structure anisotropy (obtained from structure tensor analysis) and were used separately in a regression analysis to predict MD and FAIP, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was also trained to predict the dMRI maps from histology patches. The association between MRI and histology was analyzed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2). Regions showing unexplained variance (large residuals) were analyzed to identify features apart from cell density and structure anisotropy that could influence MD and FAIP. Results: Cell density assessed by histology poorly explained intra-tumor variability at the mesoscopic level (200 m) in MD (median R2 = 0.06, interquartile range 0.01 - 0.29) or FAIP (median R2 = 0.19, 0.09 - 0.29). Samples with low R2 for FAIP exhibited low variations throughout the samples and thus low explainable variability, however, this was not the case for MD. Across tumors, cell density and structure anisotropy were associated with MD (R2 = 0.58) and FAIP (R2 = 0.82), respectively. In 37% of the samples (6 out of 16), cell density did not explain intra-tumor variability of MD when compared to the degree explained by the CNN. Tumor vascularization, psammoma bodies, microcysts, and tissue cohesivity were associated with bias in MD prediction when solely CD was considered. Our results support that FAIP is high in the presence of elongated and aligned cell structures, but low otherwise. Conclusion: Cell density and structure anisotropy account for variability in MD and FAIP across tumors but cell density does not explain MD variations within the tumor, which means that low or high values of MD locally may not always reflect high or low tumor cell density. Features beyond cell density need to be considered when interpreting MD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated segmentation of fetal intracranial volume in 3D ultrasound using deep learning: identifying sex differences in prenatal brain development</a></h4>

              
                The human brain undergoes major developmental changes during pregnancy. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images allow for the opportunity to investigate typical prenatal brain development on a large scale. Here, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automated segmentation of fetal intracranial volume (ICV) from 3D ultrasound, and we applied the trained model in a large independent sample (N = 9795 ultrasounds; N=1763 participants) from the YOUth Baby and Child cohort measured at 20- and 30-week of gestational age to investigate sex differences in fetal ICV and ICV growth. 168 3D ultrasound images with ICV annotations were included to develop a 3D CNN model for automated fetal ICV segmentation. A data augmentation strategy provided physical variation and additional data to train the network. K-fold cross-validation and Bayesian optimization were used for network selection and the ensemble-based system combined multiple networks to form the final ensemble network. The final ensemble network produced consistent and high-quality segmentations of ICV. Our trained model successfully predicted ICV and ICV growth in a large independent longitudinal data set. Boys had significantly larger ICV at 20- (B=2.83; p=1.4e-13) and 30-weeks of pregnancy (B=12.01; p=2.0e-28), and more pronounced ICV growth than girls (t=-4.395; p=1.3e-5). Our approach provides us with the opportunity to investigate fetal brain development on a much larger scale and to answer fundamental questions related to prenatal brain development.

                A wealth of correlational evidence suggests that Broca's area (the left inferior frontal gyrus) plays a role in second language acquisition. With the use of highly focal non-invasive brain stimulation, evidence for a targeted brain region's causal role in some cognitive behavior can be assessed. Over three sessions, each one week apart, we used online anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over Broca's area during a novel foreign grammar training session. During training, participants who were naive to Spanish were tasked with acquiring present tense conjugation rules for the three Spanish verb endings. In Session 1, we observed significant improvement in performance in two linguistic (reception and production) tasks but not in a non-linguistic (working memory) task. Sessions 2 and 3 were subject to a ceiling effect, which obscured any potentially long-lasting effects of the stimulation. We interpret these results as support for the idea that Broca's area has languagelike specificity that is not limited to receptive or productive processes and as evidence that Broca's area plays a causal role in foreign grammar acquisition.

                Previous research has focused on the role of the extrastriate body area (EBA) in categoryspecific body representation, but the specific features that are represented in this area are not well understood. This study used ultra-high field fMRI and banded ridge regression to investigate the coding of body images by comparing the performance of three encoding models in predicting brain activity in ventral visual cortex and specifically the EBA. Our results suggest that EBA represents body stimuli based on a combination of low-level visual features and postural features.

                Neural decoding is a powerful method to analyze neural activity. However, the code needed to run a decoding analysis can be complex, which can present a barrier to using the method. In this paper we introduce a package that makes it easy to perform decoding analyses in the R programing language. We describe how the package is designed in a modular fashion which allows researchers to easily implement a range of different analyses. We also discuss how to format data to be able to use the package, and we give two examples of how to use the package to analyze real data. We believe that this package, combined with the rich data analysis ecosystem in R, will make it significantly easier for researchers to create reproducible decoding analyses, which should help increase the pace of neuroscience discoveries.

                As we move toward population-level developmental neuroscience, understanding intra- and interindividual variability in brain maturation and sources of neurodevelopmental heterogeneity becomes paramount. Large-scale, longitudinal neuroimaging studies have uncovered group-level neurodevelopmental trajectories, and while recent work has begun to untangle intra- and interindividual differences, they remain largely unclear. Here, we aim to quantify both intra- and inter-individual variability across facets of neurodevelopment from late childhood to early adolescence in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, and examine the contributions of age, sex, puberty, sociodemographic factors, and MRI scanner manufacturer to inter-individual variability. Our results provide novel insight into differences in microstructure development between cortical and subcortical gray matter. We found that an individual's starting point is related to how their brain changes, across all brain outcomes. Although both sex and pubertal status contributed to inter-individual variability, we found limited support for hypotheses regarding greater male-than-female variability and increases in inter-individual variability throughout puberty. Finally, we uncovered enmeshed contributions of sociodemographics and MRI scanner manufacturers to inter-individual variability in this dataset, due in part to sociodemographic differences in participants scanned on Siemens, GE, and Philips MRIs. This work highlights pockets of individual variability for future investigation, describes a promising approach for quantifying deviations from normative development, and urges caution in covariate choice for investigators using ABCD Study data.

                Clinical and neuroscientific studies suggest a link between psychological stress and reduced brain health - in healthy humans and patients with neurological disorders. However, it is unclear which neural pathways mediate between stress and brain health and whether these pathways are similar in health and disease. Here, we applied an Arterial-Spin-Labeling MRI stress task in 42 healthy persons and 56 with multiple sclerosis. We tested whether brain-predicted age differences ("brain-PAD"), a highly sensitive structural brain health biomarker derived from machine learning, mirror functional connectivity between stress-responsive regions. We found that regional neural stress responsivity did not differ between groups. Although elevated brain-PAD indicated worse brain health in patients, anterior insula-occipital functional connectivity correlated with brain-PAD in both groups. Grey matter variations contributed similarly to brain-PAD in both groups. These findings suggest a generic connection between stress and brain health whose impact is amplified in multiple sclerosis by disease-specific vulnerability factors.

We identified seven representative FC patterns (FC states) in the resting-state activity of marmosets. The most prevalent two FC patterns (VC1 and VC2) corresponds to a state of BOLD coherence of primary visual and auditory processing regions. Our results suggested that the spontaneous activity does reflect the inherent properties of the brain of marmosets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Off the shelf: Investigating transfer of learning using commercially available virtual reality equipment</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of virtual reality (VR) has created the opportunity for a relatively low-cost and accessible method to practice motor skills. Previous studies have demonstrated how motor skill practice in non-immersive virtual environments transfers to physical environments. Though minimal research has investigated motor learning and transfer within immersive VR, multiple experiments provide empirical evidence of positive transfer effects. To enhance the similarities between virtual and physical environments, most studies have used software engines and modified hardware. However, many learners and practitioners are currently using commercially available VR with the goal of enhancing real-world performance, though there is very little evidence to support the notion of positive transfer for these systems. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate how motor skill practice using a commercially available VR system improved real-world performance and how that compared to physical practice. Participants (n = 68) were randomly selected into one of two groups: virtual reality (VR) practice (n = 33) or real-world (RW) practice (n = 35). The experiment took place over two consecutive days with a pretest, posttest, and practice phase occurring on both days. The pre- and post- testing phases were identical for both groups and consisted of putting a golf ball 10 times on a carpeted surface towards the center of a target. The practice phases consisted of 60 total putts per day in the respective environment (VR or RW). Participants continuously alternated golf putting holes from three different distances until they accrued 60 total putts. Participants in the RW group performed golf putts to three targets. Participants in the VR group also performed golf putts on three different miniature golf putting holes, using the commercially available Oculus Rift and the Cloudlands VR Minigolf game. The VR putting targets were designed to replicate the putting holes in the physical environment. Separate 2 (condition) x 4 (test phase) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess accuracy and club head kinematics. The results revealed a significant main effect for test phase, but not for condition. Post hoc analyses revealed both groups significantly improved their putting accuracy and club head kinematics at similar rates. The results from this study indicate that the transfer of learning that occurred from the commercially available VR practice was equally effective when compared to RW practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics and maintenance of categorical responses in primary auditory cortex during task engagement</a></h4>

              
                Grouping sets of sounds into relevant categories is an important cognitive ability that facilitates the association of stimuli with appropriate goal-directed behavioral responses. In perceptual tasks, a prominent role of primary auditory cortex (A1) is to multiplex the encoding of sound sensory features and task variables. Here we investigated the involvement of A1 in initiating sound categorization. We trained ferrets to discriminate click trains of different rates in a Go/No-Go delayed categorization task and recorded neural activity during both active behavior and passive exposure to the same sounds. Purely categorical response components were extracted and analyzed separately from sensory responses to reveal their contributions to the overall population response throughout the trials. We found that population-level representation of Go/No-Go behavioral categories emerged during sound presentation and was present in both active behavioral and passive states. However, upon task engagement, categorical responses to the No-Go category became suppressed, leading to an asymmetrical representation of the Go stimuli relative to the No-Go sounds and prestimulus baseline. At stimulus offset, the population code changed abruptly but categorical representation was maintained during the delay period. Categorical responses extracted from the stimulus period correlated with the ones found in the delay epoch, suggesting an early contribution of A1 to stimulus categorization.

                The role of reactive astrocytes in perinatal white matter injury (WMI) is unclear. In a mouse model of WMI, we provide evidence that impairing the formation of a C3-expressing neuroinflammatory reactive astrocyte sub-state rescues myelination and behavioral deficits. We further demonstrate the presence of C3-expressing reactive astrocytes in human WMI. Our data point to these cells as putative drivers of myelination failure in WMI and a potentially promising therapeutic target.

                The complex symbiotic relationship between the mammalian body and gut microbiome plays a critical role in the health outcomes of offspring later in life. The gut microbiome modulates virtually all physiological functions through direct or indirect interactions to maintain physiological homeostasis. Previous studies indicate a link between maternal/early-life gut microbiome, brain development, and behavioral outcomes relating to social cognition. Here we present direct evidence of the role of the gut microbiome in brain development. Through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we investigated the impact of the gut microbiome on brain organization and structure using germ-free (GF) mice and conventionalized mice, with the gut microbiome reintroduced after weaning. We found broad changes in brain volume in GF mice that persist despite the reintroduction of gut microbes at weaning. These data suggest a direct link between the maternal gut or early-postnatal microbe and their impact on brain developmental programming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MTL neurons phase-lock to human hippocampal theta</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation depends on neural activity across a network of regions, including the hippocampus and broader medial temporal lobe (MTL). Interactions between these regions have been studied indirectly using functional MRI, but the bases for inter-regional communication at a cellular level remain poorly understood. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that oscillatory currents in the hippocampus synchronize the firing of neurons both within and outside the hippocampus. We recorded extracellular spikes from 1,854 single- and multi-units simultaneously with hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs) in 28 neurosurgical patients who completed virtual navigation experiments. A majority of hippocampal neurons phase-locked to oscillations in the slow (2-4Hz) or fast (6-10Hz) theta bands, with a significant subset exhibiting nested slow theta x beta frequency (13-20Hz) phase-locking. Outside of the hippocampus, phase-locking to hippocampal oscillations occurred only at theta frequencies and primarily among neurons in the entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Extrahippocampal neurons phase-locked to hippocampal theta even when theta did not appear locally. These results indicate that spike-time synchronization with hippocampal theta is a defining feature of neuronal activity in the hippocampus and structurally-connected MTL regions. Theta phase-locking could mediate flexible communication with the hippocampus to influence the content and quality of memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on the Transcriptomic Signatures in Alcohol Use Disorder- a Translational Approach</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex mental disease with a large treatment need. However, the clinically available therapeutic approaches are limited and thus new treatment targets are warranted. One approach to discover new treatment targets is transcriptomic profiling of key brain regions of the addiction neurocircuitry in animal models of AUD and/or in post-mortem brain tissue from deceased AUD patients. Unfortunately, those studies suffer from large heterogeneity and low sample sizes. Here we used a cross-species meta-analysis that integrates the entire literature on this topic to make more robust conclusions on transcriptomic changes in AUD. Here, we report on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 108 rat brain and 380 human brain samples, respectively in one of the key regions of AUD- the prefrontal cortex. We found 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in rat brain, which were mainly associated with pro-oncogenic molecules, signal transduction as well as oxidative stress and inflammation. When we compared these findings with the meta-analytic results in human post-mortem PFC, we found that across species Hsd11b1 is significantly down-regulated. This finding is also confirmed by our cross-species data integrational approach. In summary, our data suggests that down-regulation of Hsd11b1 enzyme and stress-related pathways is a conserved mechanism for the alcohol dependent phenotype across different species, which might explain increased cortisol levels in AUD and therefore serves as a new treatment target.

                We apply deep learning to the problem of segmenting the arterial system from T1w and T2w images. We use the freely available 7-Tesla 'forrest' dataset from OpenNeuro, (which contains TOF, T1w, and T2w) and use supervised learning with T1w or T2w as input, and TOF segmentation as ground truth, to train a Unet architecture capable of segmenting arteries and quantifying arterial diameters from T1w or T2w images alone. We demonstrate arterial segmentations from both T1w and T2w images, and show that T2w images have sufficient vessel contrast to estimate arterial diameters comparable to those estimated from TOF. We then apply our Unet to T2w images from a separate dataset (IXI) and show our model generalizes to images acquired at different field strength. We consider this work proof-of concept that arterial segmentations can be derived from MRI sequences with poor contrast between arteries and surrounding tissue (T1w and T2w), due to the ability of deep convolutional networks to extract complex features based on local image intensity. Future work will focus on improving the generalizability of the network to non forrest datasets, with the eventual goal of leveraging the entire pre-existing corpus of neuroimaging data for study of human cerebrovasculature.

                Heterozygous mutation of Ambra1, known as a positive autophagy regulator, produces autism-like behavior in mice and autistic phenotypes in humans in a female-specific manner. However, the substantial roles of the Ambra1 mutation in neurons are still unknown. We find that Ambra1 heterozygotes display a moderate decrease in excitatory synaptic release in-vitro and ex-vivo exclusively in females without autophagy activity, resulting in significant alterations in {gamma}-oscillation power and seizure susceptibility by excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Specifically, Ambra1 deficiency has no effect on neurogenesis and morphogenesis, but selectively decreases excitatory synaptic activity without changes in synapse number, quantal size, synaptic release probability, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the limited excitatory synaptopathy by Ambra1 expression levels ultimately determines E/I imbalance in global neural networks leading to the female-specific ASD.

                In the early visual system, corticothalamic feedback projections greatly outnumber thalamocortical feedforward projections. Extensive experimental and modeling work has been devoted to the functional impact of the feedforward pathway, but the role of its denser feedback counterpart remains elusive. Here, we propose a novel unifying framework where thalamic recurrent interactions and corticothalamic feedback act in a closed-loop fashion to attune multiple stimulus representations. At each position of the visual field, the loop puts into competition local representations of the stimulus in thalamus and cortex through direct excitation of narrow topologically-aligned portions of the thalamus, accompanied with peri-geniculate nucleus mediated broad inhibition suppressing the topological surround. We built a detailed conductance-based spiking model incorporating retinal input, lateral geniculate nucleus, peri-geniculate nucleus, primary visual cortex, and all the relevant intra-areal and feedback pathways. For the first time we perform comparative analyses between model configurations with completely or locally inactivated cortico-thalamic feedback, as in the experimental preparations. The model mechanistically explains (i) the existence of intra-thalamic surround suppression, (ii) the sensitivity of thalamic neurons to orientation tuning, (iii) the cortex-dependent center-surround opponency in thalamic cells, (iv) the cortical increase of size and orientation selectivity, (v) the cortically enhanced competition between cross-oriented domains within the hypercolumn, and (vi) the selective suppression of cortical functional connectivity. Our results integrate decades of experimental and theoretical research, supporting the hypothesis that cortico-thalamic loop exerts competitive influence between neighboring regions in the thalamus and cortex, complementing the lateral intra-V1 interactions in center-surround contextual modulation.

	<p>We developed and evaluated an interpersonal model of depression in employees, where passion and perseverance affect occupational stress and perceived control, which in turn affect risk of depression. The participants were employees of 18 private companies and local government organizations in Korea aged 19 to 65 years. A total of 11,422 participants completed questionnaires including the Korean version of the Grit scale, the occupational stress scale, the perceived control subscale in the perceived stress scale, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Mediation analysis was performed to determine relationships among trait-level passion and perseverance, work-related stress, perceived control, and depression. Passion and perseverance preceded depression in employees. Higher occupational stress and lower perceived control mediated the association between passion and depression, and between perseverance and depression. Passion and perseverance exert preventive effects on depression by decreasing workplace stress and elevating perceived control. Future studies should investigate the effects of psychological characteristics on the development of depression in employees.</p>

	<p>Resting-state fMRIs (rs-fMRIs) have been widely used for investigation of diverse brain functions, including brain cognition. The rs-fMRI has easily elucidated rs-fMRI metrics, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and degree centrality (DC). To increase the applicability of these metrics, higher reliability is required by reducing confounders that are not related to the functional connectivity signal. Many previous studies already demonstrated the effects of physiological artifact removal from rs-fMRI data, but few have evaluated the effect on rs-fMRI metrics. In this study, we examined the effect of physiological noise correction on the most common rs-fMRI metrics. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated measurements on parcellated brain areas by applying physiological noise correction based on the RETROICOR method. Then, we evaluated the correction effect for five rs-fMRI metrics for the whole brain: FC, fALFF, ReHo, VMHC, and DC. The correction effect depended not only on the brain region, but also on the metric. Among the five metrics, the reliability in terms of the mean value of all ROIs was significantly improved for FC, but it deteriorated for fALFF, with no significant differences for ReHo, VMHC, and DC. Therefore, the decision on whether to perform the physiological correction should be based on the type of metric used.</p>

	<p>Dysfunction of the lenticular nucleus is thought to contribute to neurological symptoms in Wilson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (WD). However, very little is known about whether and how the lenticular nucleus influences dystonia by interacting with the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. To solve this problem, we recruited 37 WD patients (20 men; age, 23.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.95 years; age range, 12&amp;amp;ndash;37 years) and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) (25 men; age, 25.19 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.88 years; age range, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30 years), and each subject underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scans. The muscle biomechanical parameters and Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) were used to evaluate the level of dystonia and clinical representations, respectively. The lenticular nucleus, including the putamen and globus pallidus, was divided into 12 subregions according to dorsal, ventral, anterior and posterior localization and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was calculated for each subregion. The relationships between FC changes in the lenticular nucleus with muscle tension levels and clinical representations were further investigated by correlation analysis. Dystonia was diagnosed by comparing all WD muscle biomechanical parameters with healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, FC decreased from all subregions in the putamen except the right ventral posterior part to the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and decreased FC of all subregions in the putamen except the left ventral anterior part to the cerebellum was observed in patients with WD. Patients with WD also showed decreased FC of the left globus pallidus primarily distributed in the MCC and cerebellum and illustrated decreased FC from the right globus pallidus to the cerebellum. FC from the putamen to the MCC was significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms. FC from the putamen to the cerebellum was significantly correlated with muscle tension and neurological symptoms. Additionally, the FC from the globus pallidus to the cerebellum was also associated with muscle tension. Together, these findings highlight that lenticular nucleus&amp;amp;ndash;cerebellum circuits may serve as neural biomarkers of dystonia and provide implications for the neural mechanisms underlying dystonia in WD.</p>

	<p>The relationship between brain areal activity and the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity is unknown, and understanding this relationship is imperative for understanding the neural mechanisms of human brain function at systems level. The complex activity of human brains varies from area to area and from time to time across the whole brain. BOLD-fMRI measures this spatiotemporal activity at a large-scale systems level. The BOLD time signal of an area reflects a collective neuronal activity of over one million neurons under that area, and the temporal correlation of this time signal with that of every point in the brain yields a full spatial map that characterizes the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional co-activity (FC) relative to that area&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity. Here we show a quantitative relationship between brain areal activity and the activity of the entire brain. The temporal correlation coefficient r of the signal time courses of two areas quantifies the degree of co-activity between the two areas, and the spatial correlation coefficient R of their corresponding two FC maps quantifies the co-activity between these two maps. We found that a modified sigmoid function quantified this R with r, i.e., Rr=1+ra&amp;amp;minus;1&amp;amp;minus;ra1+ra+1&amp;amp;minus;ra, revealing a relationship between the activity of brain areas and that of the entire brain. The parameter a in this equation was found to be associated with the mean degree of the temporal co-activity among all brain areas, and its value was brain functional state dependent too. Our study demonstrated a novel approach for analyzing fMRI data to holistically characterize the entire brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity quantitatively for any brain functional state in individual humans.</p>

	<p>As medical technology continues to improve, many patients diagnosed with brain injury survive after treatments but are still in a coma. Further, multiple clinical studies have demonstrated recovery of consciousness after transcranial direct current stimulation. To identify possible neurophysiological mechanisms underlying disorders of consciousness (DOCs) improvement, we examined the changes in multiple resting-state EEG microstate parameters after high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). Because the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is closely related to consciousness, it is often chosen as a stimulation target for tDCS treatment of DOCs. A total of 21 patients diagnosed with prolonged DOCs were included in this study, and EEG microstate analysis of resting state EEG datasets was performed on all patients before and after interventions. Each of them underwent 10 anodal tDCS sessions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over 5 consecutive working days. According to whether the clinical manifestations improved, DOCs patients were divided into the responsive (RE) group and the non-responsive (N-RE) group. The dynamic changes of resting state EEG microstate parameters were also analyzed. After multiple HD-tDCS interventions, the duration and coverage of class C microstates in the RE group were significantly increased. This study also found that the transition between microstates A and C increased, while the transition between microstates B and D decreased in the responsive group. However, these changes in EEG microstate parameters in the N-RE group have not been reported. Our findings suggest that EEG neural signatures have the potential to assess consciousness states and that improvement in the dynamics of brain activity was associated with the recovery of DOCs. This study extends our understanding of the neural mechanism of DOCs patients in consciousness recovery.</p>

	<p>Most conventional post-stroke rehabilitation treatments do not involve imposed constraints of the unaffected limb. In contrast, Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is comprised of massed task practice with the affected limb and constraint of the unaffected limb. CIMT is a promising rehabilitation technique used for motor recovery of affected limbs after stroke, but its effectiveness and mechanism are not fully understood. We compared the effects of the two exercise modes on limb function post-stroke in animal models and human subjects, and investigated whether oxidative stress response was involved in regulating the effects. We first conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which 84 subjects with cerebral infarction were assigned to dose-matched constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), or unconstraint exercise (UE), or conventional rehabilitation treatment. Motor functions of the limb are primary outcomes of the RCT measured using Brief Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer upper extremity score (FMA-UE), Ashworth score, and Barthel scale. Psychological influence of CIMT and UE was also examined using Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Next, we investigated the effects of CIMT and UE in rats undergoing middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). Motor function, infarct volume, and pathohistological changes were investigated by mNSS, MRI, and histological studies. The role of Keap1-Nrf2-ARE was investigated using qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunochemistry, immunofluorescence, and ELISA experiments. In RCT, patients taking CIMT had a higher score in FMA-UE, Barthel index, and SDS, and a lower score in modified Ashworth, compared to those taking UE. In rats receiving CIMT, motor function was increased, and infarct volume was decreased compared to those receiving UE. The expression of Keap1 protein and mRNA in the peri-infarct tissue was decreased, and Nrf2 and ARE protein and mRNA were increased in rats receiving CIMT compared with UE. Nrf2 agonist t-BHQ increased the benefits of CIMT. In conclusion, CIMT is more effective than UE in improving upper limb motor function, reducing muscle spasm in patients with cerebral infarction compared to UE, but patients receiving CIMT may feel depressed. Moreover, both CIMT and UE are beneficial to limb function recovery and limit the infarct expansion in MCAO/R rats, but CIMT was more effective than UE. Oxidative stress reaction has an essential role in regulating the CIMT induced benefits.</p>

	<p>We investigated the effects of mirror visual feedback (MVF), with reference to using a glass wall or a covered mirror, on the reduction of spatial neglect for patients with stroke. A total of 21 subacute patients with left spatial neglect after right-hemispheric stroke were randomly assigned to 3 groups: MVF, sham 1 (viewing the hemiparetic arm through the transparent glass during bilateral arm movement) and sham 2 (using a covered mirror). The 3-week treatment program for all groups consisted of 12 sessions of movement tasks for the hemiparetic arm graded according to the severity of arm impairments. Blinded assessments were administered at pre/post and a three-week follow-up. The results showed that there was no significant advantage for MVF than sham 1; however, MVF was more beneficial than sham 2, as shown by the line crossing (p = 0.022). Improvement in discriminating the left-gap figures on the left and right side of the page in the Gap Detection Test was greater in MVF than using the covered mirror (p = 0.013; p = 0.010), showing a slight advantage of MVF in alleviating allocentric symptoms. Our study confirms that MVF was superior to using a covered mirror as a method for reducing spatial neglect and in alleviating its allocentric symptoms, but no significant advantage over bilateral arm movement through transparent glass was found. Further research in comparing their therapeutic effects is warranted.</p>

	<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) remains the leading cause of coma, and early arousal recovery indicators are needed to allocate critical care resources properly. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have been shown to indicate responsive wakefulness days following CA. Nonetheless, their potential in the acute recovery phase, where the injury is reversible, has not been tested. We hypothesize that time-frequency (TF) analysis of HFOs can determine arousal recovery in the acute recovery phase. To test our hypothesis, eleven adult male Wistar rats were subjected to asphyxial CA (five with 3-min mild and six with 7-min moderate to severe CA) and SSEPs were recorded for 60 min post-resuscitation. Arousal level was quantified by the neurological deficit scale (NDS) at 4 h. Our results demonstrated that continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of SSEPs localizes HFOs in the TF domain under baseline conditions. The energy dispersed immediately after injury and gradually recovered. We proposed a novel TF-domain measure of HFO: the total power in the normal time-frequency space (NTFS) of HFO. We found that the NTFS power significantly separated the favorable and unfavorable outcome groups. We conclude that the NTFS power of HFOs provides earlier and objective determination of arousal recovery after CA.</p>

	<p>The septal complex regulates both motivated and innate behaviors, chiefly by the action of its diverse population of long-range projection neurons. A small population of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic cells in the lateral septum projects deep into subcortical regions, yet on its way it also targets neighboring medial septum neurons that profusely innervate cortical targets by ascending synaptic pathways. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation and extracellular recordings in acutely anesthetized transgenic mice to show that lateral septum somatostatin neurons can disinhibit the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway, thus enhancing the amplitude and synchrony of theta oscillations while depressing sharp-wave ripple episodes in the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that septal somatostatin cells can recruit ascending cholinergic pathways to promote hippocampal theta oscillations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and glia have distinct yet interactive functions but are both characterized by branching morphology. Dendritic trees have been digitally traced for over 40 years in many animal species, anatomical regions, and neuron types. Recently, long-range axons also are being reconstructed throughout the brain of many organisms from invertebrates to primates. In contrast, less attention has been paid until lately to glial morphology. Thus, although glia and neurons are similarly abundant in the nervous systems of humans and most animal models, glia have traditionally been much less represented than neurons in morphological reconstruction repositories such as NeuroMorpho.Org. This is rapidly changing with the advent of high-throughput glia tracing. NeuroMorpho.Org introduced glial cells in 2017 and today they constitute nearly a third of the database content. It took NeuroMorpho.Org 10 years to collect the first 40,000 neurons and now that amount of data can be produced in a single publication. This not only demonstrates the spectacular technological progress in data production, but also demands a corresponding advancement in informatics processing. At the same time, these publicly available data also open new opportunities for quantitative analysis and computational modeling to identify universal or cell-type-specific design principles in the cellular architecture of nervous systems. As a first application, we demonstrated that supervised machine learning of tree geometry classifies neurons and glia with practically perfect accuracy. Furthermore, we discovered a new morphometric biomarker capable of robustly separating these cell classes across multiple species, brain regions, and experimental preparations, with only sparse sampling of branch measurements.</p>

     alt="Human cortical amygdala dendrites and spines morphology under open-source three-dimensional reconstruction procedures"/>
<p>Golgi-impregnated human neurons and dendritic spines were 3D reconstructed using opensource software. A pyramidal-like neuron from the human cortical amygdaloid complex with various spiny dendritic segments can be observed at different angles of rotation. Spines in a <i>continuum</i> of shapes and sizes were reconstructed using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. They were classified as stubby (s), wide (w), thin (t), mushroom-like (m), ramified (r), or “atypical”/transitional ones (a).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visualizing nerve cells has been fundamental for the systematic description of brain structure and function in humans and other species. Different approaches aimed to unravel the morphological features of neuron types and diversity. The inherent complexity of the human nervous tissue and the need for proper histological processing have made studying human dendrites and spines challenging in postmortem samples. In this study, we used Golgi data and open-source software for 3D image reconstruction of human neurons from the cortical amygdaloid nucleus to show different dendrites and pleomorphic spines at different angles. Procedures required minimal equipment and generated high-quality images for differently shaped cells. We used the “single-section” Golgi method adapted for the human brain to engender 3D reconstructed images of the neuronal cell body and the dendritic ramification by adopting a neuronal tracing procedure. In addition, we elaborated 3D reconstructions to visualize heterogeneous dendritic spines using a supervised machine learning-based algorithm for image segmentation. These tools provided an additional upgrade and enhanced visual display of information related to the spatial orientation of dendritic branches and for dendritic spines of varied sizes and shapes in these human subcortical neurons. This same approach can be adapted for other techniques, areas of the central or peripheral nervous system, and comparative analysis between species.</p>

<p>Photomicrograph of orexinergic neurons forming the main orexinergic neuronal cluster in the hypothalamus of a Southeast African cheetah. While showing the standard features of the orexinergic system, the Southeast African cheetah, along with an Asiatic and an African lion, also exhibits specializations in the organization of this system. This has implications for sleep and arousal in these large carnivores. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Employing orexin-A immunohistochemistry, we describe the distribution, morphology, and nuclear parcellation of orexinergic neurons within the hypothalami of an Asiatic lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>persica</i>), an African lion (<i>Panthera leo</i> subsp. <i>melanochaita</i>), and a Southeast African cheetah (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i> subsp. <i>jubatus</i>). In all three felids, the clustering of large, bipolar, and multipolar hypothalamic orexinergic neurons primarily follows the pattern observed in other mammals. The orexinergic neurons were found, primarily, to form three distinct clusters—the main, zona incerta, and optic tract clusters. In addition, large orexinergic neurons were observed in the ventromedial supraoptic region of the hypothalamus, where they are not typically observed in other species. As has been observed in cetartiodactyls and the African elephant, a cluster of small, multipolar orexinergic neurons, the parvocellular cluster, was observed in the medial zone of the hypothalamus in all three felids, although this parvocellular cluster has not been reported in other carnivores. In both subspecies of lions, but not the cheetah, potential orexin-immunopositive neurons were observed in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, the lateral part of the retrochiasmatic area, and the inner layer of the median eminence. The distribution and parcellation of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalami of the three felids studied appear to be more complex than observed in many other mammals and for the two subspecies of lion may be even more complex. These findings are discussed in terms of potential technical concerns, phylogenetic variations of this system, and potentially associated functional aspects of the orexinergic system.</p>

     alt="Cortical synapses of the world's smallest mammal: An FIB/SEM study in the Etruscan shrew"/><p>The present work provides a quantitative dataset of synapses from the Etruscan shrew (the smallest known terrestrial mammal). We have identified common and differing principles of synaptic organization compared to other mammalian species.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The main aim of the present study was to determine if synapses from the exceptionally small brain of the Etruscan shrew show any peculiarities compared to the much larger human brain. We analyzed the cortical synaptic density and a variety of structural characteristics of 7,239 3D reconstructed synapses, using using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM). We found that some of the general synaptic characteristics are remarkably similar to those found in the human cerebral cortex. However, the cortical volume of the human brain is about 50,000 times larger than the cortical volume of the Etruscan shrew, while the total number of cortical synapses in human is only 20,000 times the number of synapses in the shrew, and synaptic junctions are 35% smaller in the Etruscan shrew. Thus, the differences in the number and size of synapses cannot be attributed to a brain size scaling effect but rather to adaptations of synaptic circuits to particular functions.</p>

<p>The morphology of the pretectum and associated tegmentum was investigated in crocodilians. These findings are compared with similar structures in other reptiles and birds. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In all vertebrates, the pretectum and associated tegmentum arise from prosomere 1, but the adult derivatives of these embryonic regions are not well defined in reptiles—especially in crocodiles, the reptilian group most closely related to birds. Despite its importance in vision and visuomotor behavior, descriptions of the pretectum in crocodiles are brief and photographs are lacking. To fill this gap in knowledge, the pretectum and associated tegmentum were examined in two crocodilians, <i>Caiman crocodilus</i> and <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, using a variety of histological stains in all three traditional planes of section. These observations were compared with similar studies in other reptiles and birds. These comparisons were hampered by differences in nomenclature and limited data. Nevertheless, pretectal nuclei in receipt of retinal input in crocodiles, other reptiles, and birds were the most easily identified when compared with the present analysis. Despite identifying the traditional nuclei comprising the pretectum of crocodiles, other areas remain to be characterized. Nevertheless, knowledge gained from this description will aid further investigations of this brain region in crocodiles and other reptiles as well as provide a reference for developmental studies in crocodiles.</p>

Enhanced <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression in astrocytes requires cell activation and IL-6. Our data suggest different roles for CYP46 in both types of cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46), a member of the <i>cytochrome P450</i> superfamily of enzymes, is selectively expressed in the brain and is mainly responsible for cholesterol turnover in the central nervous system. Although increased <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression has been linked to cognitive alterations in aging and observed in neurodegenerative diseases and after traumatic brain injury, a detailed characterization of the brain regions and cell types in which CYP46 is expressed in old individuals has not been performed. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we investigated the specific regions and cell populations in the brain, in which <i>cyp46A1</i> is expressed in 24-month-old mice. We found that CYP46 is localized in the same neuronal populations in young and old brains, mainly in the hippocampus, in cortical layers, and in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. No increase in CYP46 levels was found in astrocytes in old mice brains, in primary astrocyte-neuron cocultures aged in vitro, or in primary cultures of senescent astrocytes. However, interleukin-6 treatment strongly induced <i>cyp46A1</i> expression in reactive astrocytes characterized by high GFAP levels but had no effect in nonactivated astrocytes. Our data suggest that cholesterol-24-hydroxylase expression is triggered in reactive astrocytes in response to proinflammatory signals, probably as part of a response mechanism to injury.</p>

     alt="Diversity of cellular physiology and morphology of Purkinje cells in the adult zebrafish cerebellum"/><p>Simplified local circuitry of the zebrafish cerebellum based on our results. Four subtypes of Purkinje cells (Type I, II, IIIa, and IIIb) were identified based on the patterns of their dendritic arbors. Their physiology was also variable, but distinguishable from that of nearby eurydendroid cells. All subtypes of Purkinje cells receive parallel fiber (PF) inputs but in a selective manner. While Type II, IIIa, and IIIb cells respond to climbing fiber (CF) activation, it is uncertain whether Type I cells receive CF input. Like the Type I Purkinje cells, eurydendroid cells respond to PF, but not to CF activation. Thus, the zebrafish cerebellar cortex may perform different computations according to its diverse Purkinje cell subtypes, hence requiring a reevaluation of the learning rules expressed in its circuitry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study was designed to explore the functional circuitry of the adult zebrafish cerebellum, focusing on its Purkinje cells and using whole-cell patch recordings and single cell labeling in slice preparations. Following physiological characterizations, the recorded single cells were labeled for morphological identification. It was found that the zebrafish Purkinje cells are surprisingly diverse. Based on their physiology and morphology, they can be classified into at least three subtypes: Type I, a <i>narrow spike cell</i>, which fires only narrow Na<sup>+</sup> spikes (&lt;3 ms in duration), and has a single primary dendrite with an arbor restricted to the distal molecular layer; Type II, a <i>broad spike cell</i>, which fires broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (5–7 ms in duration) and has a primary dendrite with limited branching in the inner molecular layer and then further radiates throughout the molecular layer; and Type III, a <i>very broad spike cell</i>, which fires very broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (≥10 ms in duration) and has a dense proximal dendritic arbor that is either restricted to the inner molecular layer (Type IIIa), or radiates throughout the entire molecular layer (Type IIIb). The graded paired-pulse facilitation of these Purkinje cells’ responses to parallel fiber activations and the all-or-none, paired-pulse depression of climbing fiber activation are largely similar to those reported for mammals. The labeled axon terminals of these Purkinje cells end locally, as reported for larval zebrafish. The present study provides evidence that the corresponding functional circuitry and information processing differ from what has been well-established in the mammalian cerebellum.</p>

     alt="Bulbar projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons send collateral branches extensively and selectively to primary olfactory cortical regions"/>
<p>Olfactory bulb projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons arising from the horizontal diagonal band also send collateral branches extensively to primary olfactory cortical regions. Thus, bulbar GABAergic projections may simultaneously modulate bulb and primary olfactory cortex through these extensive collateral branches.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circuit operations of the olfactory bulb are modulated by higher order projections from multiple regions, many of which are themselves targets of bulbar output. Multiple glutamatergic regions project to the olfactory bulb, including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), prefrontal cortex (PFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and tenia tecta (TT). In contrast, only one region provides GABAergic projections to the bulb. These GABA neurons are located in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca extending posteriorly through the magnocellular preoptic nucleus to the nucleus of the lateral olfactory bulb. However, it was unclear whether bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons collaterallize projecting to other brain regions. To address this, we mapped collateral projections from bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons using intersectional strategies of viral and traditional tract tracers. This approach revealed bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons show remarkable specificity targeting other primary olfactory cortical regions exhibiting abundant collateral projections into the accessory olfactory bulb, AON, PFC, PC, and TT. The only "nonolfactory" region receiving collateral projections was sparse connectivity to the medial prefrontal orbital cortex. This suggests that basal forebrain inhibitory feedback also modulates glutamatergic feedback areas that are themselves prominent bulbar projection regions. Thus, inhibitory feedback may be simultaneously modulating both synaptic processing of olfactory information in the bulb and associational processing of olfactory information from primary olfactory cortex. We hypothesize that these olfactory GABAergic feedback neurons are a regulator of the entire olfactory system.</p>

                Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) are a group of congenital medical conditions defined as atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical sex. Psychiatric, behavioral, and gender-associated problems could arise in both male and female adult with DSD. Structured assessments for each variable are needed to properly measure psychiatric and sexual issues and overall quality of life in adults with DSD. This study aims to review structured questionnaire instruments that had been used to assess psychiatric, behavioral, sexual problems, and quality of life in adults with DSD. For psychiatric or behavioral problems, adults with DSD can be assessed with GHQ-28, Brief Symptoms Inventory, Achenbach and Rescorla’s Adult Behavior Checklist, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview plus, Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Body image scale, Adult ADHD self-report scale screener, Short Autism Spectrum Quotient, and coping with DSD questionnaire. For quality of life, assessment could be done with WHOQOL and Short Form-36. Gender role assessment in adults with DSD can be done using Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Role Behavior and Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale. Both of the apparent male and female DSD patients can be assessed using the instruments available. Recommendations are made based on its function, compliance, validity, reliability, and avaibility of an Indonesian version of the questionnaire. There are a plethora of structured questionnaire tools that have been used to measure psychiatric or behavioral problems, quality of life, and gender roles in adult with DSD, each with its own advantages and disadvantages

                Background: Asiatic acid (AA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid derivative of Centella asiatica (CA) with neuroprotective effect. The study aimed to design an ideal oral drug delivery system to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) and develop chitosan-embedded liposomes comprising an extract of CA (CLCAE) and compare them with the chitosan-coated liposomes of asiatic acid (CLAA) for oral delivery to treat the initial phases of AD.  Methods: The solvent evaporation technique was used to develop CLCAE and CLAA, optimised with the experiment's design, and was further evaluated. Results: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies confirmed coating with chitosan. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated the successful formation of CLCAE and CLAA. Differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) confirmed the drug-phospholipid complex. Furthermore, the rate of in vitro release of CLCAE and CLAA was found to be 69.43±0.3 % and 85.3±0.3 %, respectively, in 24 h. Ex vivo permeation of CLCAE and CLAA was found to be 48±0.3 % and 78±0.3 %, respectively. In the Alcl3-induced AD model in rats, disease progression was confirmed by Y-maze, the preliminary histopathology evaluation showed significantly higher efficacy of the prepared liposomes (CLCAE and CLAA) compared to the Centella asiatica extract (CAE) and they were found to have equivalent efficacy to the standard drug (rivastigmine tartrate). The considerable increase in pharmacodynamic parameters in terms of neuronal count in the CLAA group indicated the protective role against Alcl3 toxicity and was also confirmed by assessing acetylcholine (Ach) levels. The pharmacokinetic study, such as Cmax, Tmax, and area under curve (AUC) parameters, proved an increase in AA bioavailability in the form of CLAA compared to the pure AA and CLCAE forms. Conclusion: The preclinical study suggested that CLAA was found to have better stability and an ideal oral drug delivery system to treat AD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mathematical modeling of HIV-HCV co-infection model: Impact of parameters on reproduction number [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are both classified as blood-borne viruses since they are transmitted through contact with contaminated blood. Approximately 1.3 million of the 2.75 million global HIV/HCV carriers are people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV co-infection has a harmful effect on the progression of HCV, resulting in greater rates of HCV persistence after acute infection, higher viral levels, and accelerated progression of liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. In this study, we developed and investigated a mathematical model for the dynamical behavior of HIV/AIDS and HCV co-infection, which includes therapy for both diseases, vertical transmission in HIV cases, unawareness and awareness of HIV infection, inefficient HIV treatment follow-up, and efficient condom use. Methods: Positivity and boundedness of the model under investigation were established using well-known theorems. The equilibria were demonstrated by bringing all differential equations to zero. The associative reproduction numbers for mono-infected and dual-infected models were calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. The local and global stabilities of the models were validated using the linearization and comparison theorem and the negative criterion techniques of bendixson and dulac, respectively. Results: The growing prevalence of HIV treatment dropout in each compartment of the HIV model led to a reduction in HIV on treatment compartments while other compartments exhibited an increase in populations. In dually infected patients, treating HCV first reduces co-infection reproduction number Rech, which reduces liver cancer risk. Conclusions: From the model's results, we infer various steps (such as: campaigns to warn individuals about the consequences of having multiple sexual partners; distributing more condoms to individuals; continuing treatment for chronic HCV and AIDS) that policymakers could take to reduce the number of mono-infected and co-infected individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Interictal Gamma Event Connectivity Differentiates the Seizure Network and Outcome in Patients after Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Studies of interictal EEG functional connectivity in the epileptic brain seek to identify abnormal interactions between brain regions involved in generating seizures, which clinically often is defined by the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, there is evidence for abnormal connectivity outside the SOZ (NSOZ), and removal of the SOZ does not always result in seizure control, suggesting, in some cases, that the extent of abnormal connectivity indicates a larger seizure network than the SOZ. To better understand the potential differences in interictal functional connectivity in relation to the seizure network and outcome, we computed event connectivity in the theta (4&ndash;8 Hz, ThEC), low-gamma (30&ndash;55 Hz, LGEC), and high-gamma (65&ndash;95 Hz, HGEC) bands from interictal depth EEG recorded in surgical patients with medication-resistant seizures suspected to begin in the temporal lobe. Analysis finds stronger LGEC and HGEC in SOZ than NSOZ of seizure-free (SF) patients (<I>p</I> = 1.10e-9, 0.0217), but no difference in not seizure-free (NSF) patients. There were stronger LGEC and HGEC between mesial and lateral temporal SOZ of SF than NSF patients (<I>p</I> = 0.00114, 0.00205), and stronger LGEC and ThEC in NSOZ of NSF than SF patients (<I>p</I> = 0.0089, 0.0111). These results show that event connectivity is sensitive to differences in the interactions between regions in SOZ and NSOZ and SF and NSF patients. Patients with differential strengths in event connectivity could represent a well-localized seizure network, whereas an absence of differences could indicate a larger seizure network than the one localized by the SOZ and higher likelihood for seizure recurrence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Correlates of Spatial Disorientation in Head Direction Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the brain has evolved robust mechanisms to counter spatial disorientation, their neural underpinnings remain unknown. To explore these underpinnings, we monitored the activity of anterodorsal thalamic head direction (HD) cells in rats while they underwent unidirectional or bidirectional rotation at different speeds and under different conditions (light vs dark, freely-moving vs head-fixed). Under conditions that promoted disorientation, HD cells did not become quiescent but continued to fire, although their firing was no longer direction specific. Peak firing rates, burst frequency, and directionality all decreased linearly with rotation speed, consistent with previous experiments where rats were inverted or climbed walls/ceilings in zero gravity. However, access to visual landmarks spared the stability of preferred firing directions (PFDs), indicating that visual landmarks provide a stabilizing signal to the HD system while vestibular input likely maintains direction-specific firing. In addition, we found evidence that the HD system underestimated angular velocity at the beginning of head-fixed rotations, consistent with the finding that humans often underestimate rotations. When head-fixed rotations in the dark were terminated HD cells fired in bursts that matched the frequency of rotation. This postrotational bursting shared several striking similarities with postrotational "nystagmus" in the vestibulo-ocular system, consistent with the interpretation that the HD system receives input from a vestibular velocity storage mechanism that works to reduce spatial disorientation following rotation. Thus, the brain overcomes spatial disorientation through multisensory integration of different motor-sensory inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Driving event recognition using machine learning and smartphones [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The lack of real-time monitoring is one of the reasons for the lack of awareness among drivers of their dangerous driving behavior. This work aims to develop a driver profiling system where a smartphone’s built-in sensors are used alongside machine learning algorithms to classify different driving behaviors. Methods: We attempt to determine the optimal combination of smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS in order to develop an accurate machine learning algorithm capable of identifying different driving events (e.g. turning, accelerating, or braking). Results: In our preliminary studies, we encountered some difficulties in obtaining consistent driving events, which had the potential to add “noise” to the observations, thus reducing the accuracy of the classification. However, after some pre-processing, which included manual elimination of extraneous and erroneous events, and with the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we have been able to distinguish different driving events with an accuracy of about 95%. Conclusions: Based on the results of preliminary studies, we have determined that the proposed approach is effective in classifying different driving events, which in turn will allow us to determine driver’s driving behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A review of existing neonatal hyperbilirubinemia guidelines in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common conditions for neonate inpatients. Indonesia faces a major challenge in which different guidelines regarding the management of this condition were present. This study aimed to compare the existing guidelines regarding prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring in order to create the best recommendation for a new hyperbilirubinemia guideline in Indonesia. Methods:  Through an earlier survey regarding adherence to the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia guideline, we identified that three main guidelines are being used in Indonesia. These were developed by the Indonesian Pediatric Society (IPS), the Ministry of Health (MoH), and  World Health Organization (WHO). In this study, we compared factors such as prevention, monitoring, methods for identifying, risk factors in the development of neonatal jaundice, risk factors that increase brain damage, and intervention treatment threshold in the existing guidelines to determine the best recommendations for a new guideline. Results: The MoH and WHO guidelines allow screening and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia based on visual examination (VE) only. Compared with the MoH and WHO guidelines, risk assessment is comprehensively discussed in the IPS guideline. The MoH guideline recommends further examination of an icteric baby to ensure that the mother has enough milk without measuring the bilirubin level. The MoH guideline recommends referring the baby when it looks yellow on the soles and palms. The WHO and IPS guidelines recommend combining VE with an objective measurement of transcutaneous or serum bilirubin. The threshold to begin phototherapy in the WHO guideline is lower than the IPS guideline while the exchange transfusion threshold in both guidelines are comparably equal. Conclusions: The MoH guideline is outdated. MoH and IPS guidelines are causing differences in approaches to the management hyperbilirubinemia. A new, uniform guideline is required.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How adjusting elicited health utilities after the fact can adversely affect shared decision making [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The elicitation of inconsistent health-state utility values (HSUVs) is a prevalent problem. There are two approaches to address this problem: (1) intervention during the elicitation process to ensure that patients estimate consistent HSUVs; (2) no intervention during the elicitation process and inconsistent HSUVs are adjusted after the fact. This paper studies three models recently proposed for adjusting inconsistent HSUVs and consistent HSUVs that some may consider unrealistic. Analysis: The three models are analyzed using a sound theoretical framework: the mathematical equivalence of HSUVs elicited using the standard gamble and probabilities, the Fréchet bounds, and preference theory. It is proven that none of these models accounts for the Fréchet lower bound and health conditions that are preference substitutes. Results: A clinical vignette proves these models may recommend treatments that result in premature death over treatments that cause acceptable adverse effects. Conclusions: The three models are incorrect and may mislead patients and physicians to poor medical decisions. In the spirit of shared decision making, patients should be given the opportunity to reassess inconsistent HSUVs and confirm that the revised HSUVs reflect their preferences.

                Background: Advanced materials are most likely to bring future economic, environmental and social benefits. At the same time, they may pose challenges regarding their safety and sustainability along the entire lifecycle. This needs to be timely addressed by the stakeholders (industry, research, policy, funding and regulatory bodies). As part of a larger foresight project, this study aimed to identify areas of scientific research and technological development related to advanced materials, in particular advanced nanomaterials and the sub-group of smart nanomaterials. The study identified and collected data to build relevant research and innovation indicators and analyse trends, impact and other implications. Methods: This study consisted of an iterative process including a documentation phase followed by the identification, description and development of a set of core research and innovation indicators regarding scientific publications, EU projects and patents. The data was extracted mainly from SCOPUS, CORDIS and PATSTAT databases using a predefined search string that included representative keywords. The trends, distributions and other aspects reflected in the final version of the indicators were analysed, e.g. the number of items in a period of time, geographical distribution, organisations involved, categories of journals, funding programmes, costs and technology areas. Results: Generally, for smart nanomaterials the data used represent around 3.5% of the advanced nanomaterials data, while for each field analysed, they represent 4.4% for publications, 13% for projects and 1.1% for patents. The study shows current trends for advanced nanomaterials at a top-level information that can be further extended with sub-indicators. Generally, the results indicated a significant growth in research into advanced nanomaterials, including smart nanomaterials, in the last decade, leading to an increased availability of information. Conclusion: These indicators identify trends regarding scientific and technological achievements and represent an important element when examining possible impacts on society and policy implications associated to these areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elder abuse in Saudi Arabia: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Elder abuse is a common global problem that is certainly preventable. The first step to tackling elder abuse is by researching its prevalence and acknowledging it as a prevailing problem. However, there is a lack of studies on elder abuse in Saudi Arabia. In this review, the socio-forensic problem of elder abuse in Saudi Arabia is addressed.  Methods: The PubMed database was systematically searched for articles on elder abuse in Saudi Arabia from inception to 1 July 2022. Search terms included “elder abuse”, “elderly abuse”, “geriatric abuse”, “aged abuse”, “senior abuse”, and “elder maltreatment”. In addition, to detect studies reported from Saudi Arabia, the following search terms were included: “Saudi Arabia”, “KSA”, and “Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. The search results were screened for relevant articles. Studies from Saudi Arabia that addressed elder abuse were included in this review. Studies from other countries and studies that addressed abuse in other age groups were excluded.  Results: A very high percentage of the elderly in shelter homes were found to have experienced abuse, especially psychological, which resulted in an array of mental health implications such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. A high level of awareness of elder abuse, in addition to a high sense of responsibility towards the elderly, was reported.  Conclusions: As the elderly represent a significant percentage of the population in Saudi Arabia, and with the community being heavily family-centered, it is recommended to increase dedicated efforts towards nationwide research on elder abuse and to formulate effective national programs to ensure its prevention in Saudi Arabia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Concatenated 16S rRNA sequence analysis improves bacterial taxonomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microscopic, biochemical, molecular, and computer-based approaches are extensively used to identify and classify bacterial populations. Advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics workflows have facilitated sophisticated genome-based methods for microbial taxonomy although sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is widely employed to identify and classify the bacterial community as a cost-effective and single-gene approach. However, the 16S rRNA sequence-based species identification accuracy is limited by multiple copies of the gene and their higher sequence identity between closely related species. The availability of a large volume of bacterial whole-genome data provided an opportunity to develop comprehensive species-specific 16S rRNA reference libraries. Methods: The 16S rRNA copies were retrieved from the whole genomes in the complete stage at the Genome database. With defined rules, four 16S rRNA gene copy variants were concatenated to develop a species-specific reference library. The sequence similarity search was performed with a web-based BLAST program, and MEGA software was used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Results: Using this approach, species-specific 16S rRNA gene libraries were developed for four closely related Streptococcus species (S. gordonii, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae). Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis using concatenated 16S rRNA copies yielded better resolution than single gene copy approaches. Conclusions: The approach is very effective in classifying genetically related species and may reduce misclassification of bacterial species and genome assemblies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of self-efficacy in recognizing deepfakes based on personality traits  [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: While deepfake technology is still relatively new, concerns are increasing as they are getting harder to spot. The first question we need to ask is how good humans are at recognizing deepfakes - realistic-looking videos or images that show people doing or saying things that they never actually did or said generated by an artificial intelligence-based technology. Research has shown that an individual’s self-efficacy correlates with their ability to detect deepfakes. Previous studies suggest that one of the most fundamental predictors of self-efficacy are personality traits. In this study, we ask the question: how can people’s personality traits influence their efficacy in recognizing deepfakes?  Methods: Predictive correlational design with a multiple linear regression data analysis technique was used in this study. The participants of this study were 200 Indonesian young adults. Results: The results showed that only traits of Honesty-humility and Agreeableness were able to predict the efficacy, in the negative and positive directions, respectively. Meanwhile, traits of Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness cannot predict it. Conclusion: Self-efficacy in spotting deepfakes can be predicted by certain personality traits.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Rare genetic variation and outcome of surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic factors have long been debated as a cause of failure of surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). We investigated whether rare genetic variation influences seizure outcomes of MTLE surgery.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an international, multi-centre, whole-exome sequencing study of patients who underwent surgery for drug-resistant, unilateral MTLE with normal MRI or MRI-evidence of hippocampal sclerosis and ≥2-year post-surgical follow-up. Patients with either sustained seizure freedom (favourable outcome) or ongoing uncontrolled seizures since surgery (unfavourable outcome) were included. Exomes of controls without epilepsy were also included. Gene-set burden analyses were carried out to identify genes with significant enrichment of rare deleterious variants in patients compared to controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine centres from three continents contributed 206 patients operated for drug-resistant unilateral MTLE, of whom 196 (149 with favourable outcome and 47 with unfavourable outcome) were included after stringent quality control. Compared to 8,718 controls, MTLE cases carried a higher burden of ultra-rare missense variants in constrained genes that are intolerant to loss-of-function variants (odds ratio, OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.9-3.5, p=1.3E-09) and in genes encoding voltage-gated cation channels (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.4-3.8, p=2.7E-04). Proportions of subjects with such variants were comparable between patients with favourable outcome and those with unfavourable outcome, with no significant between-group differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Rare variation contributes to the genetic architecture of MTLE, but does not appear to have a major role in failure of MTLE surgery. These findings can be incorporated in presurgical decision-making and counselling.</p>

                Background: The Polish Probation Service is strongly linked to social work. This text presents how the work and the problems of clients have changed in the Polish Probation Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article presents empirical data. Methods: A questionnaire was used among 216 Polish probation officers. Results: The obtained results describe the changes in the problems experienced by clients of the Probation Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Since we can expect further increase in the frequency of occurring personal and social problems experienced by court-appointed custodians’ wards, financial resources and energy of social institutions, cooperation with court guardianship should be focused on psycho-educational campaigns concentrating on providing information on symptoms of problems in the mental and emotional sphere. Preventing exclusion of groups at risk in the labour market and supporting families to prevent the escalation of psychopathology, development of addictions and domestic violence should be priority areas.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Environmental and ecological controls of the spatial distribution of microbial populations in aggregates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eloi Martinez-Rabert, Chiel van Amstel, Cindy Smith, William T. Sloan, Rebeca Gonzalez-Cabaleiro</p>

In microbial communities, the ecological interactions between species of different populations are responsible for the spatial distributions observed in aggregates (granules, biofilms or flocs). To explore the underlying mechanisms that control these processes, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework able to describe, label and quantify defined spatial structures that arise from microbial and environmental interactions in communities. An artificial system of three populations collaborating or competing in an aggregate is simulated using individual-based modelling under different environmental conditions. In this study, neutralism, competition, commensalism and concurrence of commensalism and competition have been considered. We were able to identify interspecific segregation of communities that appears in competitive environments (<i>columned stratification</i>), and a layered distribution of populations that emerges in commensal (<i>layered stratification</i>). When different ecological interactions were considered in the same aggregate, the resultant spatial distribution was identified as the one controlled by the most limiting substrate. A theoretical modulus was defined, with which we were able to quantify the effect of environmental conditions and ecological interactions to predict the most probable spatial distribution. The specific microbial patterns observed in our results allowed us to identify the optimal spatial organizations for bacteria to thrive when building a microbial community and how this permitted co-existence of populations at different growth rates. Our model reveals that although ecological relationships between different species dictate the distribution of bacteria, the environment controls the final spatial distribution of the community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based prioritization for acquiring protection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah M. Tashjian, Toby Wise, Dean Mobbs</p>

Protection often involves the capacity to prospectively plan the actions needed to mitigate harm. The computational architecture of decisions involving protection remains unclear, as well as whether these decisions differ from other beneficial prospective actions such as reward acquisition. Here we compare protection acquisition to reward acquisition and punishment avoidance to examine overlapping and distinct features across the three action types. Protection acquisition is positively valenced similar to reward. For both protection and reward, the more the actor gains, the more benefit. However, reward and protection occur in different contexts, with protection existing in aversive contexts. Punishment avoidance also occurs in aversive contexts, but differs from protection because punishment is negatively valenced and motivates avoidance. Across three independent studies (Total <i>N</i> = 600) we applied computational modeling to examine model-based reinforcement learning for protection, reward, and punishment in humans. Decisions motivated by acquiring protection evoked a higher degree of model-based control than acquiring reward or avoiding punishment, with no significant differences in learning rate. The context-valence asymmetry characteristic of protection increased deployment of flexible decision strategies, suggesting model-based control depends on the context in which outcomes are encountered as well as the valence of the outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">scDSSC: Deep Sparse Subspace Clustering for scRNA-seq Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by HaiYun Wang, JianPing Zhao, ChunHou Zheng, YanSen Su</p>

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables researchers to characterize transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. Clustering is a crucial step in single cell analysis. Clustering analysis of transcriptome profiled by scRNA-seq can reveal the heterogeneity and diversity of cells. However, single cell study still remains great challenges due to its high noise and dimension. Subspace clustering aims at discovering the intrinsic structure of data in unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we propose a deep sparse subspace clustering method scDSSC combining noise reduction and dimensionality reduction for scRNA-seq data, which simultaneously learns feature representation and clustering via explicit modelling of scRNA-seq data generation. Experiments on a variety of scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells have shown that scDSSC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate the interpretability of clustering and downstream analysis. Compared to some popular scRNA-deq analysis methods, scDSSC outperformed state-of-the-art methods under various clustering performance metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic comparison of differential expression networks in MTB mono-, HIV mono- and MTB/HIV co-infections for drug repurposing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yao Jiang, Jia-Xuan Zhang, Rong Liu</p>

The synergy between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) could accelerate the deterioration of immunological functions. Previous studies have explored the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV mono-infection (HMI), MTB mono-infection (MMI) and MTB/HIV co-infection (MHCI), but their similarities and specificities remain to be profoundly investigated. We thus designed a computational framework named IDEN to identify gene pairs related to these states, which were then compared from different perspectives. MMI-related genes showed the highest enrichment level on a greater number of chromosomes. Genes shared by more states tended to be more evolutionarily conserved, posttranslationally modified and topologically important. At the expression level, HMI-specific gene pairs yielded higher correlations, while the overlapping pairs involved in MHCI had significantly lower correlations. The correlation changes of common gene pairs showed that MHCI shared more similarities with MMI. Moreover, MMI- and MHCI-related genes were enriched in more identical pathways and biological processes, further illustrating that MTB may play a dominant role in co-infection. Hub genes specific to each state could promote pathogen infections, while those shared by two states could enhance immune responses. Finally, we improved the network proximity measure for drug repurposing by considering the importance of gene pairs, and approximately ten drug candidates were identified for each disease state.

                <p>by Lu Bin Liu, Attila Losonczy, Zhenrui Liao</p>

First-Order, Reduced and Controlled Error (FORCE) learning and its variants are widely used to train chaotic recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and outperform gradient methods on certain tasks. However, there is currently no standard software framework for FORCE learning. We present tension, an object-oriented, open-source Python package that implements a TensorFlow / Keras API for FORCE. We show how rate networks, spiking networks, and networks constrained by biological data can all be trained using a shared, easily extensible high-level API. With the same resources, our implementation outperforms a conventional RNN in loss and published FORCE implementations in runtime. Our work here makes FORCE training chaotic RNNs accessible and simple to iterate, and facilitates modeling of how behaviors of interest emerge from neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The structure of the human LACTB filament reveals the mechanisms of assembly and membrane binding</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeremy A. Bennett, Lottie R. Steward, Johannes Rudolph, Adam P. Voss, Halil Aydin</p>

Mitochondria are complex organelles that play a central role in metabolism. Dynamic membrane-associated processes regulate mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics in response to cellular demand. In tumor cells, metabolic reprogramming requires active mitochondrial metabolism for providing key metabolites and building blocks for tumor growth and rapid proliferation. To counter this, the mitochondrial serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB) alters mitochondrial lipid metabolism and potently inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells. Mammalian LACTB is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it assembles into filaments to regulate the efficiency of essential metabolic processes. However, the structural basis of LACTB polymerization and regulation remains incompletely understood. Here, we describe how human LACTB self-assembles into micron-scale filaments that increase their catalytic activity. The electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structure defines the mechanism of assembly and reveals how highly ordered filament bundles stabilize the active state of the enzyme. We identify and characterize residues that are located at the filament-forming interface and further show that mutations that disrupt filamentation reduce enzyme activity. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that LACTB filaments can bind lipid membranes. These data reveal the detailed molecular organization and polymerization-based regulation of human LACTB and provide new insights into the mechanism of mitochondrial membrane organization that modulates lipid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structures of RecBCD in complex with phage-encoded inhibitor proteins reveal distinctive strategies for evasion of a bacterial immunity hub</a></h4>

              
                Following infection of bacterial cells, bacteriophage modulate double-stranded DNA break repair pathways to protect themselves from host immunity systems and prioritise their own recombinases. Here we present biochemical and structural analysis of two phage proteins, gp5.9 and Abc2, which target the DNA break resection complex RecBCD. These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein. In contrast, binding of Abc2 does not substantially affect the biochemical activities of isolated RecBCD. The RecBCD-Abc2 structure shows that Abc2 binds to the Chi-recognition domains of the RecC subunit in a position that might enable it to mediate the loading of phage recombinases onto its single-stranded DNA products.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Network instability dynamics drive a transient bursting period in the developing hippocampus in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous correlated activity is a universal hallmark of immature neural circuits. However, the cellular dynamics and intrinsic mechanisms underlying network burstiness in the intact developing brain are largely unknown. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to comprehensively map the developmental trajectories of spontaneous network activity in the hippocampal area CA1 of mice in vivo. We unexpectedly find that network burstiness peaks after the developmental emergence of effective synaptic inhibition in the second postnatal week. We demonstrate that the enhanced network burstiness reflects an increased functional coupling of individual neurons to local population activity. However, pairwise neuronal correlations are low, and network bursts (NBs) recruit CA1 pyramidal cells in a virtually random manner. Using a dynamic systems modeling approach, we reconcile these experimental findings and identify network bi-stability as a potential regime underlying network burstiness at this age. Our analyses reveal an important role of synaptic input characteristics and network instability dynamics for NB generation. Collectively, our data suggest a mechanism, whereby developing CA1 performs extensive input-discrimination learning prior to the onset of environmental exploration.

                Previously we showed that authentic peptide sequences could be obtained from 3.8-Ma-old ostrich eggshell (OES) from the site of Laetoli, Tanzania (Demarchi et al., 2016). Here we show that the same sequences survive in a &gt; 6.5 Ma OES recovered from a palaeosteppe setting in northwestern China. The eggshell is thicker than those observed in extant species and consistent with the Liushu <i>Struthio</i> sp. ootaxon. These findings push the preservation of ancient proteins back to the Miocene and highlight their potential for paleontology, paleoecology and evolutionary biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aurora A and cortical flows promote polarization and cytokinesis by inducing asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation</a></h4>

              
                In the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo, cell polarization and cytokinesis are interrelated yet distinct processes. Here, we sought to understand a poorly understood aspect of cleavage furrow positioning. Early <i>C. elegans</i> embryos deficient in the cytokinetic regulator centralspindlin form furrows, due to an inhibitory activity that depends on aster positioning relative to the polar cortices. Here, we show polar relaxation is associated with depletion of cortical ECT-2, a RhoGEF, specifically at the posterior cortex. Asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation requires intact centrosomes, Aurora A (AIR-1), and myosin-dependent cortical flows. Within a localization competent ECT-2 fragment, we identified three putative phospho-acceptor sites in the PH domain of ECT-2 that render ECT-2 responsive to inhibition by AIR-1. During both polarization and cytokinesis, our results suggest that centrosomal AIR-1 breaks symmetry via ECT-2 phosphorylation; this local inhibition of ECT-2 is amplified by myosin-driven flows that generate regional ECT-2 asymmetry. Together, these mechanisms cooperate to induce polarized assembly of cortical myosin, contributing to both embryo polarization and cytokinesis.

                The macroscale connectome is the network of physical, white-matter tracts between brain areas. The connections are generally weighted and their values interpreted as measures of communication efficacy. In most applications, weights are assigned based on diffusion parameters or inferred using a statistical model, although the model generally scales poorly limiting its applications to relatively small networks. In reality, the ground-truth weights are unknown, motivating the exploration of alternative edge weighted schemes. Here, we explore a simple regression-based, explanatory model that endows reconstructed fiber tracts with directed and signed weights. Benchmarking this method on Human Connectome Project data, we find that the model fits observed data well, outperforming a suite of null models. The estimated weights are subject-specific and highly reliable, even when fit using relatively few training samples. Next, we analyze the resulting network using graph-theoretic tools from network neuroscience, revealing bilaterally symmetric communities that span cerebral hemispheres. These communities exhibit a clear mapping onto known functional systems. We also study the shortest paths structure of this network, discovering that almost every edge participants in at least one shortest path. We also find evidence of asymmetric edge weights, that the network reconfigures in response to naturalistic stimuli, and that estimated edge weights differ with age. In summary, we offer a simple framework for weighting connectome data, demonstrating both its ease of implementation while benchmarking its utility for typical connectome analyses, including graph theoretic modeling and brain-behavior associations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of cardiac-induced noise in R2* maps of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Purpose Cardiac pulsation increases the noise level in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2*. Cardiac-induced noise is challenging to mitigate during the acquisition of R2* mapping data because the characteristics of this noise remain largely unknown. In this work, we characterize cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2*. Methods We introduce a sampling strategy that enables the acquisition of multi-echo data in several intervals of the cardiac cycle. From this data, we estimate the variability of brain R2* maps due to cardiac-induced fluctuations and identify the most sensitive area of k-space. From these characteristics, we derive a novel sampling strategy that successfully mitigates cardiac-induced noise in R2* maps of the brain. Results In inferior brain regions, cardiac pulsation accounts for R2* variations of up to 3s-1 across the cardiac cycle, i.e. ~35% of the overall variability. Cardiac-induced fluctuations occur throughout the cardiac cycle and exhibit a reduced intensity during the first quarter of the cycle after the detection of the systole at the finger. 50-60% of the overall cardiac-induced noise is contained near the k-space centre (k < 0.074 mm-1), corresponding to 22% of voxels at 4mm resolution. The proposed cardiac noise mitigation strategy reduces the variability of R2* estimates across repetitions by 11% in the brainstem and 6% across the whole brain. Conclusion We provide characteristics of cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2* that constitute a basis for the design of mitigation strategies during data acquisition.

                Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. Here, we establish that three genetic dopamine subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli, accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly-correlated between somas and axons within subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were not detected in one subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect dopaminergic functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-modal and multi-model interrogation of large-scale functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Current whole-brain models are generally tailored to the modelling of a particular modality of data (e.g., fMRI or MEG/EEG). Although different imaging modalities reflect different aspects of neural activity, we hypothesise that this activity arises from common network dynamics. Building on the universal principles of self-organising delay-coupled nonlinear systems, we aim to link distinct electromagnetic and metabolic features of brain activity to the dynamics on the macroscopic structural connectome. To jointly predict dynamical and functional connectivity features of distinct signal modalities, we consider two large-scale models generating local short-lived 40 Hz oscillations with various degrees of realism - namely Stuart Landau (SL) and Wilson and Cowan (WC) models. To this end, we measure features of functional connectivity and metastable oscillatory modes (MOMs) in fMRI and MEG signals - and compare them against simulated data. We show that both models can represent MEG functional connectivity (FC) and functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) to a comparable degree, by varying global coupling and mean conduction time delay. For both models, the omission of delays dramatically decreased the performance. For fMRI, the SL model performed worse for FCD, highlighting the importance of balanced dynamics for the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns of ultra-slow dynamics. Notably, optimal working points varied across modalities and no model was able to achieve a correlation with empirical FC higher than 0.45 across modalities for the same set of parameters. Nonetheless, both displayed the emergence of FC patterns beyond the anatomical framework. Finally, we show that both models can generate MOMs with empirical-like properties. Our results demonstrate the emergence of static and dynamic properties of neural activity at different timescales from networks of delay-coupled oscillators at 40 Hz. Given the higher dependence of simulated FC on the underlying structural connectivity, we suggest that mesoscale heterogeneities in neural circuitry may be critical for the emergence of parallel cross-modal functional networks and should be accounted for in future modelling endeavours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal ripples coincide with ''up-state'' and cortical spindles in Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                During NREM sleep hippocampal Sharp-wave ripples (SWR) events are thought to stabilize memory traces for long-term storage in downstream neocortical structures. Within the neocortex, Default Mode Network (DMN) areas interact preferentially with the hippocampus purportedly to consolidate those traces. Transient bouts of slow oscillations and sleep spindles in DMN areas are often observed around SWRs, suggesting that these two activities are related and that their interplay possibly contributes to memory consolidation. To investigate how SWRs interact with the DMN and spindles, we combined cortical wide-field voltage imaging, ECoG, and hippocampal LFP recordings in anesthetized and sleeping mice. Here we show that, during SWR, ''up-states'' and spindles reliably co-occur in a cortical subnetwork centered around the Retrosplenial cortex. Furthermore, Retrosplenial transient activations and spindles predict Slow Gamma oscillations in CA1 during SWRs. Together, our results suggest that Retrosplenial-hippocampal interaction may be a central source of information exchange between cortex and hippocampus.

                Mixed findings have been reported for the nonconscious processing of fearful faces. Here, we used multivariate pattern analysis on electroencephalography data from three backward masking experiments to decode the conscious and nonconscious processing of fearful faces. Three groups of participants were shown pairs of faces that were presented either subliminally (16 ms) or supraliminally (266 ms) and were required to complete tasks where the face stimuli were either task-relevant (Experiment 1) or task-irrelevant (Experiments 2 and 3). We decoded the neural activity to examine the temporal dynamics of visual awareness, and to investigate whether the presence and location of a fearful face were processed when levels of awareness varied. The results reveal that the spatial location of fearful faces can be decoded from neural patterns only when they are consciously seen and relevant to participants' task. Nevertheless, the processing of the mere presence of fearful faces can occur in the absence of visual awareness, and the related neural patterns can be generalised to the conscious, non-spatial processing of fearful faces. Additionally, the flexibility of spatial attention seems to modulate the processing of fearful faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rewarding capacity of optogenetically activating a giant GABAergic central-brain interneuron in larval Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are a powerful study case for understanding the neural circuits underlying behavior. Indeed, the numerical simplicity of the larval brain has permitted the reconstruction of its synaptic connectome, and genetic tools for manipulating single, identified neurons allow neural circuit function to be investigated with relative ease and precision. We focus on one of the most complex neurons in the brain of the larva (of either sex), the GABAergic anterior paired lateral neuron (APL). Using behavioral and connectomic analyses, optogenetics, Ca2+ imaging and pharmacology, we study how APL affects associative olfactory memory. We first provide a detailed account of the structure, regional polarity, connectivity, and metamorphic development of APL, and further confirm that optogenetic activation of APL has an inhibiting effect on its main targets, the mushroom body Kenyon cells. All these findings are consistent with the previously identified function of APL in the sparsening of sensory representations. To our surprise, however, we found that optogenetically activating APL can also have a strong rewarding effect. Specifically, APL activation together with odor presentation establishes an odor-specific, appetitive, associative short-term memory, whereas naive olfactory behavior remains unaffected. An acute, systemic inhibition of dopamine synthesis as well as an ablation of the dopaminergic pPAM neurons impair reward learning through APL activation. Our findings provide a study case of complex circuit function in a numerically simple brain, and suggest a previously unrecognized capacity of central-brain GABAergic neurons to engage in dopaminergic reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neurophysiology of closed-loop auditory stimulation in sleep: a MEG study</a></h4>

              
                Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) is a brain modulation technique in which sounds are timed to enhance or disrupt endogenous neurophysiological events. CLAS of slow oscillation up-states in sleep is becoming a popular tool to study and potentially enhance sleep's functions, as it can increase slow oscillations, evoke sleep spindles, and enhance memory consolidation of certain tasks. However, few studies have examined the specific neurophysiological mechanisms involved in CLAS, in part because of practical limitations to commonly-used tools. To evaluate evidence for possible models of how sound stimulation during brain up-states might generate slow oscillations, we simultaneously recorded electro- and magnetoencephalography in human participants who received auditory stimulation across sleep stages and neural oscillation phases. The results suggest that auditory information reaches ventral frontal lobe areas via non-lemniscal pathways. From there, a slow oscillation is created and propagated. We demonstrate that while the state of excitability of tissue in auditory cortex and frontal ventral regions shows some synchrony with the EEG-recorded up-states that are commonly used for CLAS, it is the state of ventral frontal regions that is most critical for slow oscillation generation. Our findings advance models of how CLAS leads to enhancement of slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and associated cognitive benefits, and offer insight into how the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques can be improved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct spatial maps and multiple object codes in the lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is a major cortical input area to the hippocampus and it is crucial for associative object-place-context memories. An unresolved question is whether these associations are performed exclusively in the hippocampus or also upstream thereof. Anatomical evidence suggests that the LEC processes both object and spatial information. We here describe a gradient of spatial selectivity along the antero-posterior axis of the LEC. We demonstrate that the LEC generates distinct spatial maps for different contexts that are independent of object coding and vice versa, thus providing evidence for pure spatial and pure object codes upstream of the hippocampus. Whilst space and object coding occur by and large separately in the LEC, we identified neurons that encode for space and objects conjunctively. Together, these findings point to a scenario in which the LEC sustains both distinct space and object coding as well as associative space-object coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential response of patient-derived primary glioblastoma cells to metabolic and adhesion inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                Purpose This study aims to investigate Glioblastoma (GBM) cellular response to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors in the context of cell migration and cell-matrix adhesion properties. GBM is the most common incurable brain tumour. Decades of work into GBM chemical and molecular classification have identified mechanisms of drug resistance. Inhibitors targeting cancer cell migration and proliferation rarely take into consideration the heterogeneous migration property amongst cells, which may impact patients response to treatment. Methods Tissue samples were obtained from spatially distinct locations with different 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescent intensities, strong strongly fluorescent tumour cores, a weak fluorescent tumour rim, and nonfluorescent tumour margins. Samples were previously shown to be associated with different motility and adhesion properties. We tested the cell response to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors using metabolic assays. Cell survival was also monitored using time-lapse microscopy, while cultured on low-modulus polydimethylsiloxane representative of the stiffness of brain tissue. Results Metabolic viability assays, MTT and Cell Titer, showed substantial heterogeneity in drug potency. Highly fluorescent tumour core cells were significantly more resistant to an F0F1 ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin), and a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098), and cell proliferation ceased post-treatment in vitro. Cells derived from non-fluorescent tumour margins exhibited higher potency for the ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin). However, cell proliferation persisted post-treatment. Conclusion Our study suggests that the adhesive and migration properties of cells account for the sensitivity to therapeutics in different regions of the tumour in individual patients and between patients with GBM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A duration-dependent interaction between high-intensity light and optical refocus in the drive for myopia control</a></h4>

              
                PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration-dependent and synergetic impact of high-intensity light (HL) and optical refocus (RF) on lens-induced myopia (LIM) development in chickens. METHODS: Myopia was induced in one eye in chicks (10 groups, n=126) from day 1 post-hatching (D1) until D8 using -10D lenses. Fellow eyes remained uncovered as controls. Nine groups were exposed daily to continuous 2 hours (h), 4h, or 6h of either HL (15,000 lux); RF (removal of -10D lens); or both (HL+RF). One group served as the LIM group without any interventions. Ocular axial length (AL), refractive error, and choroidal thickness were measured on D1, D4, and D8. Outcome measures are expressed as inter-ocular difference (IOD= experimental - control eye) +/-SEM. RESULTS: By D8, LIM increased AL (0.36 +/- 0.04 mm), myopic refraction (-9.02 +/- 0.37D), and choroidal thinning (-90.27 +/- 16.44 micron) in the LIM group (all, P<0.001). Compared to the LIM group, exposure to 2h, 4h, or 6h of HL, RF, or HL+RF reduced myopic refraction in a duration-dependent manner, with RF being more effective than HL (P<0.05). Only 6h of HL+RF (not 2h or 4h) prevented LIM and was more effective than RF (P=0.004) or HL (P<0.001) in reducing myopic refraction, and more effective than HL (P<0.001) in reducing axial elongation. CONCLUSION: Daily exposure to 2h, 4h, or 6h of HL, RF, or HL+RF reduced lens-induced myopic refraction in a duration-dependent manner in chickens. Only 6h of HL+RF completely stopped LIM development. The synergetic effect of HL and RF is dependent on the duration of the interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory cortical responses to speech are shaped by statistical learning of short-term speech input regularities</a></h4>

              
                Speech perception presents an exemplary model of how neurobiological systems flexibly adjust when input departs from the norm. Dialects, accents, and even head colds can negatively impact comprehension by shifting speech from listeners' expectations. Comprehension improves with exposure to shifted speech regularities, but there is no neurobiological model of this rapid learning. We used electroencephalography to examine human auditory cortical responses to utterances that varied only in fundamental frequency (F0, perceived as voice pitch) as we manipulated the statistical distributions of speech acoustics across listening contexts. Participants overtly categorized speech sampled across two acoustic dimensions that signal /b/ from /p/ (voice onset time [VOT] and F0) to model typical English speech regularities or an expectation-violating accent. These blocks were interleaved with passive exposure to two F0-distinguished test stimuli presented in an oddball ratio to elicit a cortical mismatch negativity (MMN) response. F0 robustly influenced speech categorization when short-term regularities aligned with English but F0 exerted no influence in the context of the accent. The short-term regularities modulated event-related potentials evoked by F0-distinguished test stimuli across both N1 and P3 temporal windows and, for P3 amplitude, there was a strong correlation with perceptual down-weighting of F0. The influence of the short-term regularities persisted to impact MMN in interleaved passive listening blocks when regularities mirrored English but were absent when regularities conveyed the accent. Thus, cortical response is modulated as a function of statistical regularities of the listening context, likely reflecting both early dimension encoding and later categorization.

                Lysosomal dysfunction is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), and variants in several PD-associated genes, including LRRK2, perturb lysosomal homeostasis. Based on this, LRRK2 kinase inhibition is being explored as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. LRRK2 inhibitors reduce levels of BMP, an endolysosomal lipid involved in glycosphingolipid (GSL) catabolism, in urine from preclinical models and clinical subjects, however, the mechanisms by which LRRK2 regulates BMP and the functional significance of this change to disease are undefined. We establish that LRRK2 regulates secretion of BMP- and GSL-containing vesicles from kidney into urine and modulates BMP and GSL levels in the brain. BMP accumulates within lysosomes as a secondary response to LRRK2's effects on the activity of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a PD-linked enzyme involved in GSL catabolism. Alterations in BMP and GCase substrate turnover are observed in CSF from LRRK2-PD patients, highlighting the relevance of LRRK2-dependent lysosomal dysfunction in disease.

                Research on psychopathy has so far been largely limited to the investigation of high-level processes, such as emotion perception and regulation. In the present work, we investigate whether psychopathy has an effect on the estimation of fundamental physical parameters, which are computed in the brain during early stages of sensory processing. We employed a simple task in which participants had to estimate their interpersonal distance from a moving avatar and stop it at a given distance. The face expression of the avatars were positive, negative, or neutral. Participants carried out the task online on their home computers. We measured the psychopathy level via a self-report questionnaire. Regardless of the degree of psychopathy, the facial expression of the avatars showed no effect on distance estimation. Our results show that individuals with a high degree of psychopathy underestimate distance of approaching avatars significantly less (let the avatar approach them significantly closer) than did participants with a lesser degree of psychopathy. Moreover, participants who scored high in Self Centered Impulsivity underestimate the distance to approaching avatars significantly less (let the avatar approach closer) than participants with a low score. Distance estimation is considered an automatic process performed at early stages of visual processing. Therefore, our results imply that psychopathy affects basic early sensory processes, such as feature extraction, in the visual cortex.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the highest incidence amongst the pediatric population and its mild severity represents the most frequent cases. Moderate and severe injuries as well as repetitive mild TBI result in lasting morbidity. However, whether a single mild TBI sustained during childhood can produce long-lasting modifications within the brain is still debated. We aimed to assess the consequences of a single juvenile mild TBI (jmTBI) at 12 months post-injury in a mouse model. Non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed significant microstructural alterations in the hippocampus and the in the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis (SI/NB), structures known to be involved in spatial learning and memory. DTI changes paralled neuronal loss, increased astrocytic AQP4 and microglial activation in the hippocampus. In contrast, decreased astrocytic AQP4 expression and microglia activation were observed in SI/NB. Spatial learning and memory were impaired and correlated with alterations in DTI-derived derived fractional ansiotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD). This study found that a single juvenile mild TBI leads to significant region-specific DTI microstructural alterations, distant from the site of impact, that correlated with cognitive discriminative novel object testing and spatial memory impairments at 12 months after a single concussive injury. Our findings suggest that exposure to jmTBI leads to a chronic abnormality, which confirms the need for continued monitoring of symptoms and the development of long-term treatment strategies to intervene in children with concussions.

                Lissencephaly is a developmental cortical malformation characterized by reduced to absent gyri and a disorganized cortex. Heterozygous mutations in the LIS1 gene, encoding a regulator of the microtubule-motor dynein, were identified to cause lissencephaly with different severities. While the clinical disease spectrum correlates with the degree of lissencephaly, location and type of mutation does not. Here we present forebrain-type organoids from LIS1 patients with mild, moderate or severe lissencephaly that reflect disease severity in the degree of alterations of cytoarchitecture and neurogenesis. ScRNAseq data point toward a severity related dysregulation of progenitor cell homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that severity dependent alteration in microtubule stabilization is critical for the development of the phenotype. In addition, we found alterations in niche-dependent WNT-signaling mainly in severe patient-derived organoids. Thus, our data identify for the first time a clear association between the clinical severity grade of the patients and the molecular phenotype in the organoid model, suggest linked disease-mechanisms and show the sensitivity of organoid-based systems to capture different disease severities in vitro.

                Evidence from previous studies supports the concept that spinal cord injury (SCI) induced neuropathic pain (NP) has its neural roots in the peripheral nervous system. There is uncertainty about how and to which degree nociceptors and mechanoreceptors contribute. Sensorimotor activation-based interventions (e.g. treadmill training) have been shown to reduce NP following experimental SCI, suggesting transmission of pain-alleviating signals through mechanoreceptors. At the same time, nociceptors have been shown to become hyperexcitable early after SCI and peptidergic axons sprout into deeper laminae of the below injury level dorsal horn. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively understand the relative contribution of each pathway in respect to NP presentation in a moderate mouse contusion SCI model. After genetic ablation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expressing mechanoreceptors before SCI mechanical allodynia was reduced. The identical genetic ablation after SCI did not yield any change in pain behavior. CGRP sprouting into lamina III/IV below injury level as a consequence of SCI was not altered by either mechanoreceptor ablation. Moreover, detection of hyperexcitability in nociceptors, not in mechanoreceptors, in skin-nerve preparations from contusion SCI mice 7 days after injury makes a significant direct contribution of mechanoreceptors to NP maintenance unlikely. SNS reporter mice allowing specific visualization of the entire nociceptor population confirmed significant sprouting of respective neurons into laminae III/IV as early as 5 days post-injury. Genetic ablation of SNS-Cre mice severely affected their overall health condition, which precluded them to undergo experimental SCI and subsequent further analysis. Complementing animal data, quantitative sensory testing in human SCI subjects indicated reduced mechanical pain thresholds, whereas the mechanical detection threshold was not altered. Taken together, early mechanoreceptor ablation modulates pain behavior, most likely through indirect mechanisms. Hyperexcitable nociceptors with consecutive peptidergic fiber sprouting in the dorsal horn are confirmed as the likely main driver of SCI-induced NP. Future studies need to focus on injury-derived factors triggering early onset nociceptor hyperexcitability, which could serve as targets for more effective therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-subject EEG measurement of interhemispheric transfer-time for the in-vivo estimation of axonal morphology</a></h4>

              
                Assessing axonal morphology in-vivo opens new avenues for the combined study of brain structure and function. A novel approach has recently been introduced to estimate the morphology of axonal fibers from the combination of MRI data and EEG measures of the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT). In the original study, the IHTT measures were computed from EEG data averaged across a group, leading to bias of the axonal morphology estimates. Here, we seek to estimate axonal morphology from individual measures of IHTT, obtained from EEG data acquired in a visual evoked potential experiment. Subject-specific IHTTs are computed in a data-driven framework with minimal a priori constraints, based on the maximal peak of neural responses to visual stimuli within periods of statistically significant evoked activity in the inverse solution space. The subject-specific IHTT estimates ranged from 8 to 29 ms except for one participant and the between-session variability was comparable to the differences in IHTT between subjects. The scale parameter of the axonal radius distribution, computed from the IHTT estimates and the MRI data, ranged from 0 to 0.79 m. The change in axonal g-ratio with axonal radius ranged from 0.62 to 0.81 m-. The single-subject measurement of the IHTT yields estimates of axonal morphology that are consistent with histological values. However, improvement of the repeatability of the IHTT estimates is required to improve the specificity of the single-subject axonal morphology estimates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermittent cocaine self-administration has sex-specific effects on addiction-like behaviors in rats</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent access (IntA) models of cocaine self-administration were developed to better model in rodents how cocaine is used by human drug users. Compared to traditional continuous access (ContA) models, IntA has been shown to enhance several pharmacological and behavioral effects of cocaine, but few studies have examined sex differences in IntA. Moreover, no one has examined the efficacy of cue extinction to reduce cocaine seeking in the IntA model, which has previously shown to be ineffective in other models that promote habit-like cocaine seeking. Therefore, rats were implanted with jugular vein catheters and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) cannulae and trained to self-administer cocaine paired with an audiovisual cue with ContA or IntA. In subsets of rats, we evaluated: the ability of Pavlovian cue extinction to reduce cue-induced drug seeking; motivation for cocaine using a progressive ratio procedure; compulsive cocaine taking by pairing cocaine infusions with footshocks; and dependence of drug-seeking on DLS dopamine (a measure of habit-like behavior) with the dopamine antagonist cis-flupenthixol. Overall, cue extinction reduced cue-induced drug seeking after ContA or IntA. Compared to ContA, IntA resulted in increased motivation for cocaine exclusively in females, but IntA facilitated more compulsive cocaine taking exclusively in males. After 10 days of IntA training, but not fewer, drug-seeking was dependent on DLS dopamine most notably in males. Our results suggest that IntA may be valuable for identifying sex differences in the early stages of drug use and provide a foundation for the investigation of the mechanisms involved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition stabilization and paradoxical effects in recurrent neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition stabilization is considered a ubiquitous property of cortical networks, whereby inhibition controls network activity in the presence of strong recurrent excitation. In networks with fixed connectivity, an identifying characteristic of inhibition stabilization is that increasing (decreasing) excitatory input to the inhibitory population leads to a decrease (increase) in inhibitory firing, known as the paradoxical effect. However, population responses to stimulation are highly nonlinear, and drastic changes in synaptic strengths induced by short-term plasticity (STP) can occur on the timescale of perception. How neuronal nonlinearities and STP affect inhibition stabilization and the paradoxical effect is unclear. Using analytical calculations, we demonstrate that in networks with STP the paradoxical effect implies inhibition stabilization, but inhibition stabilization does not imply the paradoxical effect. Interestingly, networks with neuronal nonlinearities and STP can transition non-monotonically between inhibition-stabilization and non-inhibition-stabilization, and between paradoxically- and non-paradoxically-responding regimes with increasing excitatory activity. In summary, our work reveals the relationship between inhibition stabilization and the paradoxical effect in the presence of neuronal nonlinearity and STP, yielding several testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel Mouse Model of Chronic Primary Pain Conditions that Integrates Clinically Relevant Genetic and Environmental Factors</a></h4>

              
                Chronic primary pain conditions (CPPCs) affect over 100 million people, predominantly women. Yet, they remain ineffectively treated due, in large part, to lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. Here, we characterized a novel mouse model of CPPCs that integrated clinically-relevant genetic (catechol-o-methyltransferase; COMT knockdown) and environmental (stress and minor injury) factors. Compared to wildtype mice, COMT+/- mice undergoing the repeated swim stress and molar extraction surgery intervention exhibited pronounced multi-site body pain and depressive-like behavior lasting more than 3 months. The COMT+/- mice undergoing the intervention also exhibited enhanced activity of primary afferent DRG nociceptors innervating hindpaw and back sites and increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A. Notably, the pain and depressive-like behavior was of greater magnitude and longer duration (lasting at least 12 months) in females compared to males. Further, increases in anxiety-like behavior and IL-6 levels were female-specific. Intervention-induced body pain and nociception in COMT+/- mice was blocked by a beta-3 adrenergic antagonist, demonstrating predictive validity. Finally, the effect of COMT genotype x stress interactions on pain and IL-6 and IL-17A levels was observed in our clinical CPPC case-control cohort, demonstrating construct validity. Thus, our novel mouse model reliably recapitulates clinically- and biologically-relevant features of CPPCs and can be further implemented to test underlying mechanisms and discover new therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SNARE protein tomosyn regulates dense core vesicle composition but not exocytosis in mammalian neurons</a></h4>

              
                Tomosyn is a large, non-canonical SNARE protein proposed to act as a competitive inhibitor of SNARE complex formation in vesicle exocytosis. In the brain, tomosyn inhibits fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs), whereas its role in the fusion of neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) is unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a new mouse model allowing conditional deletion of tomosyn (Stxbp5) and its paralogue tomosyn-2 (Stxbp5l), and an assay that detects DCV exocytosis with single vesicle resolution in primary hippocampal neurons. Surprisingly, loss of both tomosyns did not affect DCV exocytosis but resulted in a strong reduction of intracellular levels of many DCV cargos, most prominently brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), granin VGF and prohormone convertase PCSK1. Reduced levels of DCV cargos were paralleled by decreased DCV size and impaired mRNA expression of the corresponding genes. We conclude that tomosyns regulate neuropeptide and neurotrophin secretion via control of DCV cargo production, and not at the step of cargo release. Our findings suggest a differential effect of tomosyn on the two main secretory pathways in mammalian neurons and argues against a conserved role of tomosyn as competitive inhibitor of SNARE complex formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Super-resolution STED imaging in the inner and outer whole-mount mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Since its invention in 1994, super-resolution microscopy has become a popular tool for advanced imaging of biological structures, allowing visualisation of subcellular structures at a spatial scale below the diffraction limit. Thus, it is not surprising that recently, different super-resolution techniques are being applied in neuroscience, e.g. to resolve the clustering of neurotransmitter receptors and protein complex composition in presynaptic terminals. Still, the vast majority of these experiments were carried out either in cell cultures or very thin tissue sections, while there are only a few examples of super-resolution imaging in thick (> ~50 um) biological samples. In that context, the mammalian whole-mount retina has rarely been studied with super-resolution microscopy. Here, we aimed at establishing a stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) microscopy protocol for imaging whole-mount retina. To this end, we developed sample preparation including horizontal slicing of retinal tissue, an immunolabeling protocol with STED-compatible fluorophores and optimised the STED microscope's settings. We labelled subcellular structures in somata, dendrites, and axons of retinal ganglion cells in the inner mouse retina. Under optimal conditions, we achieved a mean lateral spatial resolution of ~120 nm (using the full width of half-maximum as a proxy) for the thinnest filamentous structures in our preparation and a resolution enhancement of two or higher compared to conventional confocal images. When combined with horizontal slicing of the retina, these settings allowed us visualisation of putative GABAergic horizontal cell synapses in the outer retina with a similar resolution. Taken together, we successfully established a STED protocol for reliable super-resolution imaging in the whole-mount mouse retina, which enables investigating, for instance, protein complex composition and cytoskeletal ultrastructure at retinal synapses in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-based predictions of psychiatric illness-linked behaviors across the sexes</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individual differences in functional brain connectivity can be used to predict both the presence of psychiatric illness and variability in associated behaviors. However, despite evidence for sex differences in functional network connectivity and in the prevalence, presentation, and trajectory of psychiatric illnesses, the extent to which disorder-relevant aspects of network connectivity are shared or unique across the sexes remains to be determined. Methods: In this work, we used predictive modelling approaches to evaluate whether shared or unique functional connectivity correlates underlie the expression of psychiatric illness-linked behaviors in males and females in data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (n=5260; 2571 females). Results: We demonstrate that functional connectivity profiles predict individual differences in externalizing behaviors in males and females, but only predict internalizing behaviors in females. Furthermore, models trained to predict externalizing behaviors in males generalize to predict internalizing behaviors in females, and models trained to predict internalizing behaviors in females generalize to predict externalizing behaviors in males. Finally, the neurobiological correlates of many behaviors are largely shared within and across sexes: functional connections within and between heteromodal association networks including default, limbic, control, and dorsal attention networks are associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as attentional deficits. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that shared neurobiological patterns may manifest as distinct behaviors across the sexes. These results highlight the need to consider factors beyond just neurobiology in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

	<p>Background: As the global population grows, there is an increasing demand for neurologic consultation that prompts new ways to reach more patients. Telemedicine can provide an accessible, cost-effective, and high-quality healthcare services. Objectives: In this article, we highlight recent developments, achievements, and challenges regarding outcomes, clinical care, tele-education, teletreatment, teleresearch, and cybersecurity for telemedicine applied to Parkinson&amp;amp;acute;s disease (PD) and other neurological conditions. Results: A growing body of evidence supports the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine tools for PD and other movement disorders. Outcome variables regarding satisfaction and efficacy in clinical care and specific issues about education, research, and treatment are reviewed. Additionally, a specific legal framework for teleconsultation has been developed in some centers worldwide. Yet, the implementation of telemedicine is conditioned by the limitations inherent to remote neurological examination, the variable computer usage literacy among patients, and the availability of a reliable internet connection. At present, telemedicine can be considered an additional tool in the clinical management of PD patients. Conclusions: There is an increasing use of remote clinical practice regarding the management of PD and other neurological conditions. Telemedicine is a new and promising tool aimed at special settings and subpopulations.</p>

	<p>High-density electroencephalography from visual and motor cortices in addition to kinematic hand and target movement recordings were used to investigate &amp;amp;tau;-coupling between brain activity patterns and physical movements in an interceptive timing task. Twelve adult participants were presented with a target car moving towards a destination at three constant accelerations, and an effector dot was available to intercept the car at the destination with a swift movement of the finger. A &amp;amp;tau;-coupling analysis was used to investigate involvement of perception and action variables at both the ecological scale of behavior and neural scale. By introducing the concept of resonance, the underlying dynamics of interceptive actions were investigated. A variety of one- and two-scale &amp;amp;tau;-coupling analyses showed significant differences in distinguishing between slow, medium, and fast target speed when car motion and finger movement, VEP and MRP brain activity, VEP and car motion, and MRP and finger movement were involved. These results suggested that the temporal structure present at the ecological scale is reflected at the neural scale. The results further showed a strong effect of target speed, indicating that &amp;amp;tau;-coupling constants k and kres increased with higher speeds of the moving target. It was concluded that &amp;amp;tau;-coupling can be considered a valuable tool when combining different types of variables at both the ecological and neural levels of analysis.</p>

	<p>High-altitude (HA) exposure affects cognitive functions, but studies have found inconsistent results. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of HA exposure on cognitive functions in healthy subjects. A structural overview of the applied neuropsychological tests was provided with a classification of superordinate cognitive domains. A literature search was performed using PubMed up to October 2021 according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria included a healthy human cohort exposed to altitude in the field (at minimum 2440 m [8000 ft]) or in a hypoxic environment in a laboratory, and an assessment of cognitive domains. The literature search identified 52 studies (29 of these were field studies; altitude range: 2440 m&amp;amp;ndash;8848 m [8000&amp;amp;ndash;29,029 ft]). Researchers applied 112 different neuropsychological tests. Attentional capacity, concentration, and executive functions were the most frequently studied. In the laboratory, the ratio of altitude-induced impairments (64.7%) was twice as high compared to results showing no change or improved results (35.3%), but altitudes studied were similar in the chamber compared to field studies. In the field, the opposite results were found (66.4 % no change or improvements, 33.6% impairments). Since better acclimatization can be assumed in the field studies, the findings support the hypothesis that sufficient acclimatization has beneficial effects on cognitive functions at HA. However, it also becomes apparent that research in this area would benefit most if a consensus could be reached on a standardized framework of freely available neurocognitive tests.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors in microglia alleviates neuropathic hypersensitivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Drugs enhancing the availability of noradrenaline are gaining prominence in the therapy of chronic neuropathic pain. However, underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and research has thus far focused on 2-adrenergic receptors and neuronal excitability. Adrenergic receptors are also expressed on glial cells, but their roles toward antinociception are not well deciphered. This study addresses the contribution of {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}2-ARs) to the therapeutic modulation of neuropathic pain in mice. We report that selective activation of {beta}2-ARs with Formoterol inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in microglia ex-vivo and nerve injury-induced structural remodeling and functional activation of microglia in vivo. Systemic delivery of Formoterol inhibits behaviors related to neuropathic pain, such as mechanical hypersensitivity, cold allodynia and the aversive component of pain, and reverses chronically established neuropathic pain. Using conditional gene targeting for microglia-specific deletion of {beta}2-ARs, we demonstrate that the anti-allodynic effects of Formoterol are primarily mediated by microglia. Although Formoterol also reduces astrogliosis at late stages of neuropathic pain, these functions are unrelated to {beta}2-AR signaling in microglia. Our results underline the value of developing microglial {beta}2-AR agonists for relief from neuropathic pain and clarify mechanistic underpinnings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular vesicles improve GABAergic transmission in Huntington's disease iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry bioactive molecules associated with various biological processes, including miRNAs. In both Huntington's disease (HD) models and human samples, altered expression of miRNAs involved in synapse regulation were reported. Recently, the use of EV cargo to reverse phenotypic alterations in disease models with synaptopathy as the end-result of the pathophysiological cascade has become an interesting possibility. Here, we assessed the contribution of EVs to GABAergic synaptic alterations using a human HD model and studied the miRNA content of isolated EVs. After differentiating HD human induced-pluripotent stem cells into electrophysiologically active striatal-like GABAergic neurons, we found that HD-derived neurons displayed reduced density of inhibitory synapse markers and of GABA receptor-mediated ionotropic signaling. Treatment with EVs secreted by control (CTR) fibroblasts reversed the deficits in GABAergic synaptic transmission and increased the density of inhibitory synapses in HD-neuron cultures, while EVs from HD-derived fibroblasts had the opposite effects on CTR-neurons. Moreover, analysis of miRNAs from purified EVs identified a set of differentially expressed miRNAs between manifest HD, premanifest and CTR lines with predicted synaptic targets. The EVs-mediated reversal of the abnormal GABAergic phenotype in HD-derived neurons reinforces the potential role of EVs-miRNAs on synapse regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Passive identification of subjective preferences towards individual items using eye-tracking in a virtual reality environment</a></h4>

              
                Usage of Virtual reality (VR) has been growing in many fields of research and therapy thanks to its immersive and gamified nature. Detection of the subjective experience of the users is thus essential for effective personalization of content. Eye-tracking (ET) data and specifically gaze, in two-dimensional tasks has been linked to value-based choices and emotional states. Therefore, here we aimed to develop a method for passive identification of subjective preferences based on ET data collected during a VR experience. For this purpose, we developed a naturalistic dynamic VR task where participants searched and looked at complex objects of pets and control shapes that appeared in pre-defined locations in random order. At the end of the task, participants ranked their preference, valence, and arousal of the items they saw during the task. ET data was recorded using a built-in binocular eye-tracker within the VR headset. We found that the median distance of gaze from the center of objects and the median gaze scan speed showed a significant interaction with object type (pets/shapes), as well as a significant positive relation to preference and valence rankings of pets. Our results suggest that ET could be used as a passive biomarker for detecting individual preferences and pleasantness, and in the future may enable successful personalization of VR content in real time for various applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vocal learning-associated convergent evolution in mammalian proteins and regulatory elements</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal behavior based on experience, is a convergently evolved trait in birds and mammals. To identify genomic elements associated with vocal learning, we integrated new experiments conducted in the brain of the Egyptian fruit bat with analyses of the genomes of 222 placental mammals. We first identified an anatomically specialized region of the bat motor cortex containing direct monosynaptic projections to laryngeal motoneurons. Using wireless neural recordings of this brain region in freely vocalizing bats, we verified that single neuron activity in this region relates to vocal production. We profiled the open chromatin of this vocal-motor region, which we used to train machine learning models to identify enhancers associated with vocal learning across mammals. We found 201 proteins and 45 candidate enhancers that display convergent evolution associated with vocal learning, many of which overlapped loci associated with human speech disability. One such locus contains the neurodevelopmental transcription factors TSHZ3 and ZNF536 and multiple candidate vocal learning-associated enhancers, suggesting the co-evolution of protein and regulatory sequences underlying vocal learning.

	<p>Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of research on physical exercise in real-world settings on executive function of typical children and adolescents. Methods: The CNKI, WOS, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched by computer. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included literature. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency and percentage and the &amp;amp;chi;2 test. Results: A total of 49 articles was included. Acute (moderate intensity lasting 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 min) and long-term (interventions of moderate intensity of 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 min at least 3 times a week for 17 weeks or more) physical exercises in real-world settings have positive intervention effects on executive function. Furthermore, for acute interventions, closed skills are more efficient for inhibitory control, open skills are more efficient for working memory and cognitive flexibility, and open-continuous and closed-sequential skills are the most efficient; long-term interventions with open skills, sequential skills, and open-sequential skills are more effective. Conclusion: Physical exercise in real-world settings has a good promotion effect on typical children and adolescents, and motor skills with open and/or sequential attributes are more helpful in improving executive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neurophysiological Modality Effect in Native and Second Language Processing: An ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Experimental psychology has long discussed the modality effect, whereby the stimulus modality significantly affects retention of the information presented. In neurolinguistics, however, the effect of stimulus modality on language processing has gained little attention. We conducted a multi-modal event-related potential (ERP) experiment on both native and non-native Spanish speakers to investigate the possibility of a neurophysiological modality effect in language processing. Using morphosyntactically violated and orthographically/phonologically violated stimuli, we elicited a robust N400 and P600 in native speakers. We showed that the N400 has consistent features across modalities, while the P600 has modality-specific features. Specifically, the auditory evoked P600 was characterized by a more gradual slope and a later peak than the visual evoked P600. We discuss this in detail along with other modality effects observed post sensory perception. Among second language (L2) learner groups, those with higher proficiency exhibited more nativelike neurophysiological responses in both modalities when compared to those with lower proficiency. We additionally observed fewer modality-specific differences in low proficiency learners than in higher proficiency learners suggesting that modality-specific specialization in language processing comes with increased proficiency. We further discuss the question of modality-specific differences in the process of neurophysiological nativization, whereby L2 learners ERPs become increasingly on nativelike.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A data assimilation method to track time-varying changes in the excitation-inhibition balance using scalp EEG</a></h4>

              
                Recent neuroscience studies have suggested that control of the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance is important to maintain normal brain function. However, an efficient method to evaluate the timevarying changes in E/I balance of the brain has yet to be established. To tackle this issue, we propose a new approach to estimate E/I balance changes, by applying the method of neural-mass model-based tracking of the brain state using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. In this method, the parameters regarding the synaptic E/I gains of the model are estimated from observed electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, the index of E/I balance was defined by calculating the ratio between synaptic E/I gains based on estimated parameters. To validate this method, we applied it to numerical and human EEG data. As a result, we confirmed that our proposed method could estimate the E/I balance changes from observed human EEG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scalable and robust system for Audience EEG recordings</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that unfold when humans form a large group defined by an overarching context, such as audiences in theater or sports, are largely unknown and unexplored. This is mainly due to the lack of availability of a scalable system that can record the brain activity from a significantly large portion of such an audience simultaneously. Although the technology for such a system has been readily available for a long time, the high cost as well as the large overhead in human resources and logistic planning have prohibited the development of such a system. However, during the recent years reduction in technology costs and size have led to the emergence of low-cost, consumer-oriented EEG systems, developed primarily for recreational use. Here by combining such a low-cost EEG system with other off-the-shelve hardware and tailor-made software, we develop in the lab and test in a cinema such a scalable EEG hyper-scanning system. The system has a robust and stable performance and achieves accurate unambiguous alignment of the recorded data of the different EEG headsets. These characteristics combined with small preparation time and low-cost make it an ideal candidate for recording large portions of audiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron secreted chemokine-like Orion is involved in the transformation of glial cells into phagocytes in different neuronal remodeling paradigms</a></h4>

              
                During animal development, neurons often form exuberant or incorrect axons and dendrites at early stages, followed by the refinement of neuronal circuits at late stages. Neural circuit refinement leads to the production of large amounts of neuronal debris in the form of neuronal cell corpses, fragmented axons and dendrites, and pruned synapses requiring disposal. In particular, the predominant phagocytes acting during the neuronal remodeling and degeneration are glial cells and critical signaling pathways between neurons and glia leading to phagocytosis are required. Chemokine-like mushroom body neuron secreted Orion ligand was shown to be essential to the astrocyte infiltration into the {gamma} axon bundle leading to {gamma} axon pruning and clearance of debris left from axon fragmentation. Here we show a role of orion also in debris engulfment and phagocytosis. Interestingly, we show that orion is also involved in the overall transformation of astrocytes into phagocytes. In addition, analysis of several neuronal paradigms demonstrates the role of orion in the elimination of both peptidergic vCrz+ and PDF-Tri neurons via additional phagocytic glial cells as cortex and/or ensheathing glia. Our results suggest that Orion is essential for phagocytic activation of three different types of glial cells: astrocytes, cortex and ensheathing glia and point to Orion as a trigger not only of glial infiltration but also engulfment and phagocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlled delivery of ultrasound through the head for effective and safe therapies of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound provides noninvasive and reversible approaches for precise and personalized manipulations of brain circuits, with the potential to transform our understanding of brain function and treatments of brain dysfunction. However, the effectiveness and safety of these approaches have been limited by the human head, which attenuates and distorts ultrasound strongly and unpredictably. To address this lingering barrier, we have developed a Relative Through-Transmit (RTT) approach that directly measures and compensates for the attenuation and distortion of a given skull and scalp. We have implemented RTT in hardware and demonstrated that it accurately restores the operator's intended intensities inside ex-vivo human skulls. Moreover, this functionality enabled effective and intensity-dependent transcranial modulation of nerves and effective release of defined doses of propofol inside the skull. RTT was essential for these new applications of transcranial ultrasound; when not applied, there were no significant differences from sham conditions. Moreover, RTT was safely applied in humans and accounted for all intervening obstacles including hair and ultrasound coupling. This method and hardware unlock the potential of ultrasound-based approaches to provide effective, safe, and reproducible precision therapies of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motion Impact Score for Detecting Spurious Brain-Behavior Associations</a></h4>

              
                Between-participant differences in head motion introduce systematic bias to resting state fMRI brain-wide association studies (BWAS) that is not completely removed by denoising algorithms. Researchers who study traits, or phenotypes associated with in-scanner head motion (e.g. psychiatric disorders) need to know if trait-functional connectivity (FC) correlations are biased by residual motion artifact in order to avoid reporting false positive results. We devised an adaptable method, Split Half Analysis of Motion Associated Networks (SHAMAN), to assign a motion impact score to specific trait-FC correlations. The SHAMAN approach distinguishes between motion artifact causing false positive vs false negative bias. SHAMAN was > 95% specific at sample sizes of n = 100 and above. SHAMAN was 95% sensitive to detection of false positive motion impact score at sample sizes of n = 3,000 but only 59% sensitive to detection of false negative motion impact score, making it most useful for large BWAS. We computed motion impact scores for trait-FC correlations with 45 demographic, biophysical, cognitive, and personality traits from n = 7,270 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. After standard denoising with ABCD-BIDS and without motion censoring, 60% (27/45) of traits had significant (p < 0.05) false positive motion impact scores and 36% (16/45) of traits had false negative motion impact scores. Censoring at framewise displacement (FD) < 0.2 mm reduced the proportion of traits with significant false positive motion impact scores from 60% to 2% (1/45) but did not decrease the number of traits with significant false negative motion impact scores.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device): An open-source tool for recording undisturbed two-bottle drinking behavior in a home cage environment</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of rodent drinking behavior has provided insight into drivers of thirst, circadian rhythms, anhedonia, and drug and ethanol consumption. Traditional methods of recording fluid intake involve periodically weighing bottles, which is cumbersome and lacks temporal resolution. Several open-source devices have been designed to improve drink monitoring, particularly for two-bottle choice tasks. However, recent designs are limited by the use of infrared photobeam-break sensors and incompatibility with prolonged undisturbed use in ventilated home cages. Beam-break sensors lack accuracy for bout microstructure analysis and are prone to damage from rodents. To address these concerns, we designed LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device) with the goal of utilizing capacitive sensors to increase accuracy and analyze lick microstructure, building a device compatible with ventilated vivarium home cages, increasing scale with prolonged undisturbed recordings, and creating a design that is easy to build and use with an intuitive touchscreen graphical user interface. The system tracks two-bottle choice licking behavior in up to 18 rodent home cages, or 36 single bottles, on a minute-to-minute timescale controlled by a single Arduino microcontroller. The data are logged to a single SD card, allowing for efficient downstream analysis. With sucrose, quinine, and ethanol two-bottle choice tasks, we validated that LIQ HD has superior accuracy compared to beam-break sensors. The system measures preference over time and changes in bout microstructure, with undisturbed recordings lasting up to 7 days. All designs and software are open-source to allow other researchers to build upon the system and adapt LIQ HD to their animal home cages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Significantly reduced inflammatory foreign-body-response to neuroimplants and improved recording performance in young compared to adult rats</a></h4>

              
                The multicellular inflammatory encapsulation of implanted intracortical multielectrode arrays (MEA) is associated with severe deterioration of their field potentials' (FP) recording performance, which thus limits the use of brain implants in basic research and clinical applications. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to identify the conditions in which the inflammatory foreign body response (FBR) is alleviated, or to develop methods to mitigate the formation of the inflammatory barrier. Here, for the first time, we show that (1) in young rats (74{+/-}8 gr, 4 weeks old at the onset of the experiments), cortical tissue recovery following MEA implantation proceeds with ameliorated inflammatory scar as compared to adult rats (242{+/-}18 gr, 9 weeks old at the experimental onset); (2) in contrast to adult rats in which the Colony Stimulating factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) antagonist chow eliminated ~95% of the cortical microglia but not microglia adhering to the implant surfaces, in young rats the microglia adhering to the implant were eliminated along with the parenchymal microglia population. The removal of microglia adhering to the implant surfaces was correlated with improved recording performance by in-house fabricated Perforated Polyimide MEA Platforms (PPMP). These results support the hypothesis that microglia adhering to the surface of the electrodes, rather than the multicellular inflammatory scar, is the major underlying mechanism that deteriorates implant recording performance, and that young rats provide an advantageous model to study months-long, multisite electrophysiology in freely behaving rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of the relationship between auditory and visual neural sensitivity and autonomic arousal from 6m to 12m</a></h4>

              
                The differential sensitivity hypothesis argues that environmental sensitivity has the bivalent effect of predisposing individuals to both the risk-inducing and development-enhancing influences of early social environments. However, the hypothesis requires that this variation in environmental sensitivity be general across domains. In this study, we focused on neural sensitivity and autonomic arousal to test domain generality. Neural sensitivity can be assessed by correlating measures of perceptual sensitivity, as indexed by event-related potentials (ERP) in electrophysiology. The sensitivity of autonomic arousal can be tested via heart rate changes. Domain generality was tested by comparing associations in perceptual sensitivity across auditory and visual domains, and associations between sensitivity in sensory domains and heart rate We contrasted ERP components in auditory (P3) and visual (P1, N290 and P4) detection-of-difference tasks for N=68 infants longitudinally at 6 and 12 months of age. Domain generality should produce correlated individual differences in sensitivity across the two modalities, with higher levels of autonomic arousal associating with increased perceptual sensitivity. Having controlled for multiple comparisons, at 6 months of age, the difference in amplitude of the P3 component evoked in response to standard and deviant tones correlated with the difference in amplitude of the P1 N290 and P4 face-sensitive components evoked in response to fearful and neutral faces. However, this correlation was not found at 12 months of age. Similarly, autonomic arousal negatively correlated with neural sensitivity at 6 months but not at 12 months. The results suggest neural perceptual sensitivity is domain-general across auditory and visual domains, and is related to autonomic arousal at 6 months but not at 12 months of age. We interpret these findings within a neuroconstructivist framework and with respect to the concept of interactive specialisation. By 12 months of age, more experience of visual processing may have led to top-down endogenous attention mechanisms that process visual information in a way that no longer associates with auditory perceptual sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Having "multiple selves" helps learning agents explore and adapt in complex changing worlds</a></h4>

              
                Satisfying a variety of conflicting needs in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge for any adaptive agent. Here, we show that designing an agent in a modular fashion as a collection of sub-agents, each dedicated to a separate need, powerfully enhanced the agent's capacity to satisfy its overall needs. We used the formalism of deep reinforcement learning to investigate a biologically relevant multi-objective task: continually maintaining homeostasis of a set of physiologic variables. We then conducted simulations in a variety of environments and compared how modular agents performed relative to standard monolithic agents (i.e., agents that aimed to satisfy all needs in an integrated manner using a single aggregate measure of success). Simulations revealed that modular agents: a) exhibited a form of exploration that was intrinsic and emergent rather than extrinsically imposed; b) were robust to changes in non-stationary environments, and c) scaled gracefully in their ability to maintain homeostasis as the number of conflicting objectives increased. Supporting analysis suggested that the robustness to changing environments and increasing numbers of needs were due to intrinsic exploration and efficiency of representation afforded by the modular architecture. These results suggest that the normative principles by which agents have adapted to complex changing environments may also explain why humans have long been described as consisting of 'multiple selves'.

                Disruptions in capillary flow have the potential to drive pathology across numerous diseases. But our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of these events are hindered by slow volumetric imaging rates and the reliance on laborious manual analysis to process data. To address the challenges of increasing volumetric imaging speed, we use a custom-built Bessel beam two-photon microscope for efficient volumetric imaging of the capillary network. We demonstrate its ability to continuously monitor roughly 200 capillaries for capillary flow stoppages (i.e. stalling events) at a frame rate of approximately 0.5 Hz and develop a semi-automated correlation-based approach for identifying these stalling events. We applied our system and algorithm in a photothrombotic model of stroke and show elevated levels of stalling 1-week post-stroke in regions both within and outside of the stroke region, demonstrating that stalling may have impacts on stroke recovery that extend past the acute stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gestational stress decreases postpartum mitochondrial respiration in the prefrontal cortex of female rats</a></h4>

              
                Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major psychiatric complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of mothers, yet remains understudied. Mitochondria, dynamic organelles crucial for cell homeostasis and energy production, share links with many of the proposed mechanisms underlying PPD pathology. Brain mitochondrial function is affected by stress, a major risk factor for development of PPD, and is linked to anxiety-like and social behaviors. Considering the importance of mitochondria in regulating brain function and behavior, we hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with behavioral alterations in a chronic stress-induced rat model of PPD. Using a validated and translationally relevant chronic mild unpredictable stress paradigm during late gestation, we induced PPD-relevant behaviors in adult postpartum Wistar rats. In the mid-postpartum, we measured mitochondrial function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) using high-resolution respirometry. We then measured protein expression of mitochondrial complex proteins and 4-hydroxynonenal (a marker of oxidative stress), and Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in PFC and plasma. We report novel findings that gestational stress decreased mitochondrial function in the PFC, but not the NAc of postpartum dams. However, in groups controlling for the effects of either stress or parity alone, no differences in mitochondrial respiration measured in either brain regions were observed compared to nulliparous controls. This decrease in PFC mitochondrial function in stressed dams was accompanied by negative behavioral consequences in the postpartum, complex-I specific deficits in protein expression, and increased Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha cytokine levels in plasma and PFC. Overall, we report an association between PFC mitochondrial respiration, PPD-relevant behaviors, and inflammation following gestational stress, highlighting a potential role for mitochondrial function in postpartum health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping long-term changes in inputs to the ventral tegmental area after a single drug exposure</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to drugs of abuse causes long-lasting changes in connectivity to ventral tegmental area dopamine cells that contribute to drug-induced behavioral adaptations. However, it is not known which inputs are altered, largely due to technological limitations of previous methods. Here we used a rabies virus-based mapping strategy to quantify rabies-labeled inputs to ventral tegmental area cells after a single exposure to one of a variety of abused drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, and nicotine, and compared the relative global input labeling across conditions using dimensionality reduction approaches. We observed that all tested drugs of abuse elicited input changes onto dopamine cells, in particular those projecting to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, and that these changes were common to all drugs tested. Interestingly, we also noticed that animals anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture exhibit a different brain-wide input pattern from those anesthetized with isoflurane, indicating that the method of anesthesia can influence rabies input labeling by inducing long-lasting changes in circuit connectivity. In addition, many input changes were common between animals anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and those anesthetized with isoflurane but also given a single dose of a drug of abuse, suggesting that the ketamine/xylazine mixture can induce these long-lasting input changes. We found that many of the brain regions that exhibited changes in rabies input labeling in drug- vs. saline-treated mice were preferentially interconnected, and that select communities of brain regions showed similar changes for both drugs of abuse and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Lastly, the basal expression patterns of several gene classes were highly correlated with the extent of both addictive drug- or ketamine/xylazine-induced input changes, especially calcium channels. These results indicate that the expression of calcium channels is related to whether these inputs to dopamine cells are altered by drug exposure. Furthermore, ketamine/xylazine anesthesia induces a similar but different set of long-lasting input changes onto midbrain dopamine cells, indicating that caution should be taken when using ketamine/xylazine-based anesthesia in rodents when assessing motivated behaviors.

	<p>Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD). The occurrence and clinical features of fatigue in patients with prodromal PD remain largely elusive. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of fatigue in patients with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorders (iRBD). Methods: A total of 97 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients were enrolled in this study. A comprehensive neurological assessment (including motor and non-motor assessment) was performed. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Motor and non-motor characteristics were compared between iRBD patients with and without fatigue. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with fatigue. Results: The prevalence of fatigue was 35.05%. Compared to the non-fatigue patients, patients with fatigue had higher non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) score (p = 0.009), higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score (p = 0.002), and a higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (p = 0.021). Multivariate regression analysis showed that depression (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.13&amp;amp;ndash;15.49, p = 0.033) and orthostatic hypotension (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;7.18, p = 0.032) were significantly associated with fatigue in iRBD patients. Additionally, both NMSS (rs = 0.310, p = 0.002) and HAMD (rs = 0.385, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) scores were mildly correlated with fatigue severity. Conclusion: Our study showed that fatigue is common in patients with iRBD. In addition, depression and orthostatic hypotension were independently associated with fatigue in iRBD patients.</p>

	<p>Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy (SAE) is common in sepsis patients, with high mortality rates. It is believed that neuroinflammation is an important mechanism involved in SAE. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), as a late pro-inflammatory factor, is significantly increased during sepsis in different brain regions, including the hippocampus. HMGB1 causes neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment through direct binding to advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36) is beneficial for neurological diseases and experimental sepsis. Our study used EA to treat SAE induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats. The Y maze test was performed to assess working memory. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting (WB) were used to determine neuroinflammation and the HMGB1 signaling pathway. Results showed that EA could improve working memory impairment in rats with SAE. EA alleviated neuroinflammation by downregulating the hippocampus&amp;amp;rsquo;s HMGB1/TLR4 and HMGB1/RAGE signaling, reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and relieving microglial and astrocyte activation. However, EA did not affect the tight junctions&amp;amp;rsquo; expression of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus.</p>

	<p>Background: Many neurological manifestations are part of COVID-19 infections, including movement disorders, but a clinical picture closely resembling stiff-person syndrome has not yet been described. Case presentation: We report a case of a stiff-person-like syndrome in the context of COVID-19 infection. A 79-year-old woman, with no prior history of diseases, presented global reversible stiffness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to shed light on several particularities regarding this clinical picture and its evolution in close relationship with the infectious disease progression, with full regression of symptoms and signs once the infectious process ceased. The impairment of speech and motility caused the wrong diagnosis of stroke in the Emergency Room. In addition, we would also like to emphasize the concomitant rhabdomyolysis, closely linked to the grade of muscle rigidity. Conclusions: We would like to raise awareness regarding this clinical setting and its association with SARS-COV-2 infection, to aid in its future recognition and management. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a stiff-person-like syndrome to be described in association with COVID-19 infection.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is one of the most serious nervous system diseases; it can be diagnosed accurately by video electroencephalogram. In this study, we analyzed microstate epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) to aid in the diagnosis and identification of epilepsy. We recruited patients with focal epilepsy and healthy participants from the Third Xiangya Hospital and recorded their resting EEG data. In this study, the EEG data were analyzed by microstate analysis, and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for automatic epileptic EEG classification based on features of the EEG microstate series, including microstate parameters (duration, occurrence, and coverage), linear features (median, second quartile, mean, kurtosis, and skewness) and non-linear features (Petrosian fractal dimension, approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity). In the gamma sub-band, the microstate parameters as a model were the best for interictal epilepsy recognition, with an accuracy of 87.18%, recall of 70.59%, and an area under the curve of 94.52%. There was a recognition effect of interictal epilepsy through the features extracted from the EEG microstate, which varied within the 4~45 Hz band with an accuracy of 79.55%. Based on the SVM classifier, microstate parameters and EEG features can be effectively used to classify epileptic EEG, and microstate parameters can better classify epileptic EEG compared with EEG features.</p>

	<p>Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is effective for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to explore the modulating effect of prolonged longitudinal taVNS on the striatal subregions&amp;amp;rsquo; functional connectivity (FC) in MDD patients. Methods: Sixteen MDD patients were enrolled and treated with taVNS for 8 weeks. Sixteen healthy control subjects (HCs) were recruited without intervention. The resting-state FC (rsFC) based on striatal subregion seed points and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were evaluated in the MDD patients and HCs at baseline and after 8 weeks. A two-way ANCOVA test was performed on each rsFC metric to obtain the (group-by-time) interactions. Results: The rsFC values between the left ventral caudate (vCa) and right ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC), and between the right nucleus accumbens (NAc) and right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) are lower in the MDD patients compared to the HCs at baseline, and increase following taVNS; the rsFC values between the left vCa and right, superior occipital gyrus (SOG), and between the left dorsal caudate (dCa) and right cuneus are higher in MDD patients and decrease following taVNS. Conclusions: Prolonged longitudinal taVNS can modulate the striatum rsFC with the prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, and intra-striatum, and these changes partly underlie any symptomatic improvements. The results indicate that prolonged longitudinal taVNS may produce beneficial treatment effects by modulating the cortical striatum circuitry in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>The identification of reliable biomarkers in biological fluids is paramount to optimizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Measurement of A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, and p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the most accepted method to support the diagnosis of AD. However, lumbar puncture represents an invasive investigation, whereas saliva is one of the most accessible body fluids. The aim of our study was to investigate salivary concentrations in AD and evaluate the correlation between salivary and CSF A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations in AD patients, patients with non-AD dementias, and controls. We recruited 100 subjects: 18 AD patients, 64 patients with non-AD dementias, and 18 controls. The mean saliva A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations in AD patients were higher than in controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and to patients with non-AD dementias (p = 0.001). A significant negative correlation between salivary and CSF A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations was found in the overall group (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.562, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and in non-AD patients (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.443, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Salivary A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations positively correlated with CSF t-tau (r = 0.321, p = 0.001) and p-tau (r = 0.297, p = 0.001). Our study showed that in AD patients&amp;amp;rsquo; saliva, A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations are specifically increased, and we found an interesting negative correlation between CSF and salivary A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations that warrants further investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interacting active surfaces: A model for three-dimensional cell aggregates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alejandro Torres-Sánchez, Max Kerr Winter, Guillaume Salbreux</p>

We introduce a modelling and simulation framework for cell aggregates in three dimensions based on interacting active surfaces. Cell mechanics is captured by a physical description of the acto-myosin cortex that includes cortical flows, viscous forces, active tensions, and bending moments. Cells interact with each other via short-range forces capturing the effect of adhesion molecules. We discretise the model equations using a finite element method, and provide a parallel implementation in C++. We discuss examples of application of this framework to small and medium-sized aggregates: we consider the shape and dynamics of a cell doublet, a planar cell sheet, and a growing cell aggregate. This framework opens the door to the systematic exploration of the cell to tissue-scale mechanics of cell aggregates, which plays a key role in the morphogenesis of embryos and organoids.
