	<p>Background: a type D personality is a factor in a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s susceptibility to general mental stress, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many studies were conducted on the relationships among stressful situations, an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s personality, depression, and the occurrence of various diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease or cancer, there are no analogous data on people with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Aim: the assessment of TMDs and depression symptoms in students with type D personality. Material and Methods: the research was carried out with the participation of 240 physiotherapy students. The study group (G1) consisted of 120 participants with type D personalities, the control group (G2) consisted of the same number of participants, without &amp;amp;ldquo;stress&amp;amp;rdquo; personalities. All subjects were assessed for the occurrence of TMD symptoms, as well as for depression and anxiety symptoms, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), based on the proprietary questionnaire. Results: in students with type D personality symptoms, TMDs occurred significantly more often and in greater number (p = 0.00) than in those without stress personalities. The exception was the symptom of increased muscle tension, which showed no statistical difference (p = 0.22). Among the 240 respondents, depression was found in 128 people (53.3%). In the group of students with type D personalities, depression was significantly more frequent than in the group without type D personalities (p = 0.00). In participants with depression, TMD symptoms were more common, i.e., headaches, neck, and shoulder girdle pain, TMJ acoustic symptoms, increased masticatory muscle tension, teeth clenching, and teeth grinding. There was no significant difference between the incidence of depression and TMJ pain and jaw locking. There was a significant interaction between the occurrence of headaches and acoustic symptoms and the occurrence of depression. For headache and depression interactions, the OR was &amp;amp;gt;1; based on the results, we may assume that a headache depends more on the occurrence of depression rather than it being a symptom of a TMJ disorder in people with type D personalities. Conclusion: type D personality and depression may contribute to the development of TMD symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Variants in mitochondrial ATP synthase cause variable neurologic phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>ATP synthase (ATPase) is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Nevertheless, disease phenotypes associated with mutations in ATPase subunits are extremely rare. We aimed at expanding the spectrum of ATPase-related diseases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing in cohorts with 2,962 mitochondrial-disease- and/or dystonia-diagnosed individuals and international collaboration were used to identify deleterious variants in ATPase-encoding genes. Findings were complemented by transcriptional and proteomic profiling of patient fibroblasts. ATPase integrity and activity were assayed using cells and tissues from five patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We present ten total individuals with biallelic or <i>de-novo</i> monoallelic variants in nuclear ATPase subunit genes. Three unrelated patients showed the same homozygous missense <i>ATP5F1E</i> mutation (including one published case). An intronic splice-disrupting alteration in compound heterozygosity with a nonsense variant in <i>ATP5PO</i> was found in one patient. Three patients had <i>de-novo</i> heterozygous missense variants in <i>ATP5F1A</i>, whereas another three were heterozygous for <i>ATP5MC3 de-novo</i> missense changes. Bioinformatics methods and populational data supported the variants` pathogenicity. Immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and/or immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced ATPase amounts in association to <i>ATP5F1E</i> and <i>ATP5PO</i> mutations. Diminished activity and/or defective assembly of ATPase was demonstrated by enzymatic assays and/or immunoblotting in cells bearing <i>ATP5F1A</i>-p.Arg207His, <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Gly79Val, and <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Asn106Lys. The associated clinical profiles were heterogeneous, ranging from hypotonia with spontaneous resolution (1/10) to epilepsy with early death (1/10) or variable persistent abnormalities including movement disorders, developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperlactatemia, and other neurologic and systemic features. Although potentially reflecting an ascertainment bias, dystonia was common (7/10).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results establish evidence for a previously unrecognized role of ATPase nuclear-gene defects in phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of non-neural factors on BOLD signal magnitude</a></h4>

              
                To what extent is the size of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response influenced by factors other than neural activity? In a re-analysis of three neuroimaging datasets, we find large systematic inhomogeneities in the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1): stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent signal change, are up to 50% larger along the representation of the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find strong relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical thickness, cortical curvature, and the presence of large veins. These relationships are consistently found across subjects and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a regression-based correction method and show that after correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not due to neural activity differences. Additionally, we find that while the cerebral sinuses overlap with the vertical meridian representation in V1, they do not explain the observed horizontal/vertical difference. We conclude that interpretation of variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations should consider the influence of the potential confounding factors of cortical thickness, curvature, and vascularization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EMX2 transcriptionally regulates Nfib expression in neural progenitor cells during early cortical development.</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factors play key roles in regulating the onset of both neuronal and glial differentiation during cortical development. Reduced NFI expression results in delayed differentiation, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans that include intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum and macrocephaly. Despite their importance, our understanding of how individual NFI family members are regulated during cortical development remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that in mice, the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 regulates Nfib expression in radial glial cells during cortical development. Using a combination of bioinformatics, molecular and histological approaches, we demonstrate that EMX2 is able to bind to the Nfib promoter to up-regulate Nfib expression. Unexpectedly, in vivo over-expression of EMX2 in wildtype animals does not further up-regulate NFIB but instead leads to its down-regulation. Therefore, our findings suggest that EMX2 is capable of both activating and repressing Nfib, in a context-dependent manner. This bi-directional control over Nfib expression enables fine-tuning of the total level of NFI proteins expressed and could be important for cell-type specific NFI functions.

	<p>Dyslexia, a specific reading disability, is a common (up to 10% of children) and highly heritable (~70%) neurodevelopmental disorder. Behavioral and molecular genetic approaches are aimed towards dissecting its significant genetic component. In the proposed review, we will summarize advances in twin and molecular genetic research from the past 20 years. First, we will briefly outline the clinical and educational presentation and epidemiology of dyslexia. Next, we will summarize results from twin studies, followed by molecular genetic research (e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWASs)). In particular, we will highlight converging key insights from genetic research. (1) Dyslexia is a highly polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic architecture. (2) Dyslexia categories share a large proportion of genetics with continuously distributed measures of reading skills, with shared genetic risks also seen across development. (3) Dyslexia genetic risks are shared with those implicated in many other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., developmental language disorder and dyscalculia). Finally, we will discuss the implications and future directions. As the diversity of genetic studies continues to increase through international collaborate efforts, we will highlight the challenges in advances of genetics discoveries in this field.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic causes increased mental stress and decreased mobility, which may affect people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The study aimed to investigate the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of activity, quality of life (QoL) and PD-related symptoms. The respondents completed an online survey in Polish in the period from December, 2020 to June, 2021. The questionnaire was completed by 47 participants aged 43 to 90 years (mean 72.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years). A total of 94% reported reduced contact with family and friends. Over 90% remained active during the pandemic. However, 55% of people with PD showed subjectively lower level of activity then before the pandemic. Moreover, 36% of the respondents felt afraid to visit a doctor and reported problems with access to medication. Subjective QoL reduction was reported by 80%, and 83% declared worsening of PD symptoms. The post pandemic deterioration of motor symptoms in people with PD did not affect their QoL. However, the deterioration of contacts and feelings of isolation had a significant impact on the decline in quality of life (p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively) and the presence of anxiety (p = 0.035 and p = 0.007, respectively). These results may indicate than greater importance of social and mental factors than fitness and health-related factors in the QoL self-assessment of the people with PD.</p>

	<p>Central pain disorders, such as central post-stroke pain, remain clinically challenging to treat, despite many decades of pharmacological advances and the evolution of neuromodulation. For treatment refractory cases, previous studies have highlighted some benefits of cortical stimulation. Recent advances in new targets for pain and the optimization of neuromodulation encouraged our group to develop a dual cortical target approach paired with Bayesian optimization to provide a personalized treatment. Here, we present a case report of a woman who developed left-sided facial pain after multiple thalamic strokes. All previous pharmacologic and interventional treatments failed to mitigate the pain, leaving her incapacitated due to pain and medication side effects. She subsequently underwent a single burr hole for placement of motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) paddles for stimulation with externalization. By using Bayesian optimization to find optimal stimulation parameters and stimulation sites, we were able to reduce pain from an 8.5/10 to a 0/10 during a 5-day inpatient stay, with pain staying at or below a 2/10 one-month post-procedure. We found optimal treatment to be simultaneous stimulation of M1 and dlPFC without any evidence of seizure induction. In addition, we found no worsening in cognitive performance during a working memory task with dlPFC stimulation. This personalized approach using Bayesian optimization may provide a new foundation for treating central pain and other functional disorders through systematic evaluation of stimulation parameters.</p>

	<p>Due to the significant functional repercussions suffered by patients with dual disorder, we must evaluate which ones can benefit from intensive rehabilitative therapies in medium-stay psychiatric units. This was a retrospective study of patient medical records which intended to analyze sociodemographic and clinical variables and parameters related to the hospitalization and discharge of patients admitted to the Medium-Stay Unit (MSU) at the Castell&amp;amp;oacute;n Provincial Hospital Consortium over 2 years (2017 and 2018), according to the presence or absence of dual disorders in these patients. Patients with a dual disorder represented 55.2% of the hospitalized patients. A higher proportion of them were male, were relatively younger, and had an earlier onset of mental illness, fewer associated medical pathologies, and shorter hospital admission times to the Short-Term Hospitalization Unit than those who did not present a dual disorder. A diagnosis on the schizophrenia spectrum with cannabis use or polyconsumption was the most common diagnosis; 98.2% of all the patients responded adequately to admission to the MSU. This work highlighted the need for higher doses of depot paliperidone in patients with dual disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Human oligodendrocyte myelination potential; relation to age and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myelin regeneration in the human central nervous system relies on progenitor cells within the tissue parenchyma, with possible contribution from previously myelinating oligodendrocytes. In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder, variables affecting remyelination efficiency include age, severity of initial injury, and progenitor cell properties. Our aim was to investigate the effects of age and differentiation on the myelination potential of human oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We derived viable primary oligodendrocyte lineage cells from surgical resections of pediatric and adult brain tissue. Ensheathment capacity using nanofiber assays and transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing were compared between A2B5+ antibody-selected progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes (non-selected cells).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that pediatric progenitor and mature cells ensheathed nanofibers more robustly than did adult progenitor and mature cells respectively. Within both age groups, the percentage of fibers ensheathed and ensheathment length per fiber were greater for A2B5+ progenitors. Gene expression of oligodendrocyte progenitor markers <i>PDGFRA</i> and <i>PTPRZ1</i> were higher in A2B5+ vs A2B5- cells and in pediatric A2B5+ vs adult A2B5+ cells. p38 MAP kinases and actin cytoskeleton-associated pathways were upregulated in pediatric cells; both have been shown to regulate OL process outgrowth. Significant upregulation of “cell senescence” genes was detected in pediatric samples; this could reflect their role in development and the increased susceptibility of pediatric oligodendrocytes to activating cell death responses to stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings identify specific biological pathways relevant to myelination that are differentially enriched in human pediatric and adult oligodendrocyte lineage cells and suggest potential targets for remyelination enhancing therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Multisystem Involvement in Post‐acute Sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe cerebrovascular, neuropathic and autonomic features of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with chronic fatigue, brain fog and orthostatic intolerance consistent with PASC. Controls included postural tachycardia syndrome patients (POTS) and healthy participants. Analyzed data included surveys and autonomic (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor and tilt tests), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) monitoring in middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography monitoring) and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/autoimmune markers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine PASC patients were evaluated 0.7±0.3 years after a mild COVID-19 infection, treated as home observations. Autonomic, pain, brain fog, fatigue and dyspnea surveys were abnormal in PASC and POTS (n=10), compared to controls (n=15). Tilt table test reproduced the majority of PASC symptoms. Orthostatic CBFv declined in PASC (-20.0±13.4%) and POTS (-20.3±15.1%), compared to controls (-3.0±7.5%,p=0.001) and was independent of end-tidal carbon dioxide in PASC, but caused by hyperventilation in POTS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv in PASC included both subjects without (n=6) and with (n=3) orthostatic tachycardia. Dysautonomia was frequent (100% in both PASC and POTS) but was milder in PASC (p=0.013). PASC and POTS cohorts diverged in frequency of small fiber neuropathy (89% vs. 60%) but not in inflammatory markers (67% vs. 70%). Supine and orthostatic hypocapnia was observed in PASC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PASC following mild COVID-19 infection is associated with multisystem involvement including: 1) cerebrovascular dysregulation with persistent cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction; 2) small fiber neuropathy and related dysautonomia; 3) respiratory dysregulation; 4) chronic inflammation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward priming differentially modulates enhancement and inhibition in auditory decision-making</a></h4>

              
                In cognitive sciences, rewards, such as money and food, play a fundamental role in individuals' daily lives and well-being. Moreover, rewards that are irrelevant to the task alter individuals' behavior. However, it is unclear whether explicit knowledge of reward irrelevancy has an impact on reward priming enhancements and inhibition. In this study, an auditory change-detection task with task-irrelevant rewards was introduced. The participants were informed explicitly in advance that the rewards would be given randomly. The results revealed that while inhibition related to reward priming only occurred when the participants were explicitly informed about rewards, implicit instruction thereof resulted in enhancement and inhibition associated with reward priming. These findings highlight the contribution of explicit information about rewards associated with auditory decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific neuromodulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in layer 4 of rat barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in arousal, attention, vigilance, learning and memory. ACh is released during different behavioural states and affects the brain microcircuit by regulating neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigated how a low concentration of ACh (30 M) affects the intrinsic properties of electrophysiologically and morphologically identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex. ACh altered the membrane potential of L4 neurons in a heterogeneous manner. Nearly all L4 regular spiking (RS) neurons responded to bath-application of ACh with a M4 muscarinic ACh receptor-mediated hyperpolarisation. In contrast, in the majority of L4 fast spiking (FS) and non-fast spiking (nFS) interneurons 30 M ACh induced a depolarisation while the remainder showed a hyperpolarisation or no response. The ACh-induced depolarisation of L4 FS interneurons was much weaker than that in L4 nFS interneurons. There was no clear difference in the response to ACh for three morphological subtypes of L4 FS interneurons. However, in four morpho-electrophysiological subtypes of L4 nFS interneurons, VIP+-like interneurons showed the strongest ACh-induced depolarisation; occasionally, even action potential (AP) firing was elicited. The ACh-induced depolarisation in L4 FS interneurons was exclusively mediated by M1 muscarinic ACh receptors; in L4 nFS interneurons it was mainly mediated by M1 and/or M3/5 muscarinic ACh receptors. In a subset of L4 nFS interneurons, a co-operative activation of nicotinic ACh receptors was also observed. The present study demonstrates that low-concentrations of ACh affect the different L4 neurons types in a cell-type specific way. These effects result from a specific expression of different muscarinic and/or nicotinic ACh receptors on the somatodendritic compartments of L4 neurons. This suggests that even at low concentrations ACh may tune the excitability of L4 excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their synaptic microcircuits differentially depending on the behavioural state during which ACh is released.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in autism: the role of glutamate and GABA gene-sets in symptoms and cortical brain structure</a></h4>

              
                Background: The excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that an imbalance between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) mechanisms underlies the behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (autism). However, how E/I imbalance arises and how it may differ across autism symptomatology and brain regions is not well understood. Methods: We used innovative analysis methods - combining competitive gene-set analysis and gene-expression profiles in relation to cortical thickness (CT)- to investigate the relationship between genetic variance, brain structure and autism symptomatology of participants from the EU-AIMS LEAP cohort (autism=360, male/female=259/101; neurotypical control participants=279, male/female=178/101) aged 6 to 30 years. Competitive gene-set analysis investigated associations between glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling pathway gene-sets and clinical measures, and CT. Additionally, we investigated expression profiles of the genes within those sets throughout the brain and how those profiles relate to differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants in the same regions. Results: The glutamate gene-set was associated with all autism symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) within the autistic group, while the GABA set was associated with sensory processing measures (using the SSP subscales) across all participants. Brain regions with greater gene expression of both glutamate and GABA genes showed greater differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants. Conclusions: Our results suggest crucial roles for glutamate and GABA genes in autism symptomatology as well as CT, where GABA is more strongly associated with sensory processing and glutamate more with autism symptom severity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic scrambling of hippocampal theta oscillations alters working memory retrieval but not hippocampal spatiotemporal codes</a></h4>

              
                The precise temporal coordination of activity in the brain is thought to be fundamental for memory encoding and retrieval. The medial septum (MS) provides the largest source of innervation to the hippocampus (HPC), and its inhibitory neurons play a major role in controlling HPC theta (~8 Hz) oscillations. While pharmacological inhibition of the MS is associated with memory impairment, the exact role of MS inhibitory neurons in HPC function and memory is not fully understood. While HPC place cells were previously reported to not depend on MS inputs, the exact role of MS inputs on HPC temporal codes is still a matter of debate. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations do not have the temporal resolution to distinguish the role of MS activity on working memory encoding, retention and retrieval. Here we stimulated the MS with optogenetics to either pace or ablate theta, while recording large hippocampal assemblies over time using calcium imaging along with local field potentials to monitor theta control. Using scrambled light stimulation, we could robustly ablate theta signals, which was associated with direct modulation of a subpopulation of neurons in the HPC. We found that such stimulation led to decreased working memory retrieval, but not encoding in both a delayed non-match to sample task and a novel place object recognition task. Strikingly, scrambled stimulations were not associated with disrupted spatiotemporal codes. Importantly, we show that our opsin did not transfect cholinergic cells and stimulation did not disrupt HPC ripple activity or running speed, suggesting a specific role for MS GABAergic cells in memory maintenance and retrieval that is independent from these other potential confounding mechanisms. Our study suggests that theta signals play a specific and essential role in supporting working memory retrieval and maintenance while not being necessary for hippocampal spatiotemporal codes.

	<p>Contact and collision sports are believed to accelerate brain aging. Postmortem studies of the human brain have implicated tau deposition in and around the perivascular space as a biomarker of an as yet poorly understood neurodegenerative process. Relatively little is known about the effects that collision sport participation has on the age-related trajectories of macroscale brain structure and function, particularly in female athletes. Diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI were obtained from female collision sport athletes (n = 19 roller derby (RD) players; 23&amp;amp;ndash;45 years old) and female control participants (n = 14; 20&amp;amp;ndash;49 years old) to quantify structural coupling (SC) and decoupling (SD). The novel and interesting finding is that RD athletes, but not controls, exhibited increasing SC with age in two association networks: the frontoparietal network, important for cognitive control, and default-mode network, a task-negative network (permuted p = 0.0006). Age-related increases in SC were also observed in sensorimotor networks (RD, controls) and age-related increases in SD were observed in association networks (controls) (permuted p &amp;amp;le; 0.0001). These distinct patterns suggest that competing in RD results in compressed neuronal timescales in critical networks as a function of age and encourages the broader study of female athlete brains across the lifespan.</p>

     alt="Anesthesia in mice activates discrete populations of neurons throughout the brain"/>
<p>The use of transgenic TRAP*TB mice permitted visualization of neurons active during a first stage experimental condition (red) as well as neurons active during a second stage condition (green). Results varied by brain regions of interest. In PvH nearly all active neurons proved to be anesthesia-on. In PV the proportion was 11:8.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain undergoes rapid, dramatic, and reversible transitioning between states of wakefulness and unconsciousness during natural sleep and in pathological conditions such as hypoxia, hypotension, and concussion. Transitioning can also be induced pharmacologically using general anesthetic agents. The effect is selective. Mobility, sensory perception, memory formation, and awareness are lost while numerous housekeeping functions persist. How is selective transitioning accomplished? Classically a handful of brainstem and diencephalic “arousal nuclei” have been implicated in driving brain-state transitions on the grounds that their net activity systematically varies with brain state. Here we used transgenic targeted recombination in active populations mice to label neurons active during wakefulness with one reporter and neurons active during pentobarbital-induced general anesthesia with a second, contrasting reporter. We found ‘wake-on’ and ‘anesthesia-on’ neurons in widely distributed regions-of-interest, but rarely encountered neurons labeled with both reporters. Nearly all labeled neurons were either wake-on or anesthesia-on. Thus, anesthesia-on neurons are not unique to the few nuclei discovered to date whose activity appears to increase during anesthesia. Rather neuronal populations selectively active during anesthesia are located throughout the brain where they likely play a causative role in transitioning between wakefulness and anesthesia. The widespread neuronal suppression reported in prior comparisons of the awake and anesthetized brain in animal models and noninvasive imaging in humans reflects only net differences. It misses the ubiquitous presence of neurons whose activity increases during anesthesia. The balance in recruitment of anesthesia-on versus wake-on neuronal populations throughout the brain may be a key driver of regional and global vigilance states.</p>

     alt="Sub-second transient activated patterns to sad expressions in major depressive disorders discovered via hidden Markov model"/>
<p>We explored the comprehensive processing framework of negative emotional stimuli in patients with major depressive disorders. With a well-established hidden Markov model, the whole processing was segmented into three dynamic states via brain functions, and temporal–spatial dynamic dysfunction was found during different task stages in depression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (<i>p =</i> 5.38 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (<i>p</i> = 0.0062, <i>r</i> = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.</p>

     alt="Hemispheric cortical atrophy and chronic microglial activation following mild focal ischemic stroke in adult male rats"/>
<p>Localised injection of ET-1 to the motor cortex resulted in focal ischemic damage causing neuronal loss. Despite the asymptomatic nature of this model of stroke, lacking motor or cognitive impairment, chronic inflammation and hemispheric atrophy developed over time. These findings highlight that even mild stroke can result in long-term pathological outcomes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Animal modeling has played an important role in our understanding of the pathobiology of stroke. The vast majority of this research has focused on the acute phase following severe forms of stroke that result in clear behavioral deficits. Human stroke, however, can vary widely in severity and clinical outcome. There is a rapidly building body of work suggesting that milder ischemic insults can precipitate functional impairment, including cognitive decline, that continues through the chronic phase after injury. Here we show that a small infarction localized to the frontal motor cortex of rats following injection of endothelin-1 results in an essentially asymptomatic state based on motor and cognitive testing, and yet produces significant histopathological change including remote atrophy and inflammation that persists up to 1 year. While there is understandably a major focus in stroke research on mitigating the acute consequences of primary infarction, these results point to progressive atrophy and chronic inflammation as additional targets for intervention in the chronic phase after injury. The present rodent model provides an important platform for further work in this area.</p>

<p>The exercise during the adult life of the offspring, associated with iron supplementation during the pregnancies, proved to be of benefit. However, no relation was found between iron restriction in fetal programming and the occurrence of restless legs syndrome phenotype.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron restriction during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency and changes in the dopaminergic system in the adulthood of offspring, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) is closely related to these changes. Objectives: Analyze whether iron restriction during pregnancy would cause changes in the behavior, sleep, and dopaminergic system of the male offspring. In addition, we aimed to assess whether exercise would be able to modulate these variables. The pregnant rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups with different concentrations of iron in the diet: standard (St), supplementation (Su), restriction since weaning (R1), and restriction only during pregnancy (R2). After birth, the offspring were assigned to their respective groups according to the dams diet (St, Su, R1, and R2) and distributed into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) (for 8 weeks of training), reaching eight groups of offspring (O): OSt SD, OSt EX, OSu SD, OSu EX, OR1 SD, OR1 EX, OR2 SD, and OR2 EX. Sleep, behavior, and analysis of key genes of dopaminergic system (D2, DAT) were performed after 8 weeks. The results for trained offspring that the mother received supplementation diet were the most expressive, with increased freezing and the OR1 SD group showed an increase in DAT protein content. These changes may have been due to the association between the dams diet during pregnancy and the practice of exercise by the offspring. The different concentrations of iron during pregnancy caused changes in the offspring, however, they were not associated with fetal programming in the context of RLS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and affective disorders are frequently comorbid and share underlying mechanisms that could be targets for comprehensive treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has high comorbidity with AUD, but comprehensive models of this overlap are nascent. We recently characterized a model of comorbid AUD and PTSD-like symptoms, wherein stressed rats receive an inhibitory avoidance (IA)-related footshock on two occasions followed by two-bottle choice (2BC) voluntary alcohol drinking. Stressed rats received the second footshock in a familiar (FAM, same IA box as the first footshock) or novel context (NOV, single-chambered apparatus); the FAM paradigm more effectively increased alcohol drinking in males and the NOV paradigm in females. During abstinence, stressed males displayed avoidance-like PTSD symptoms, and females showed hyperarousal-like PTSD symptoms. Rats in the model had altered spontaneous action potential-independent GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala (CeA), a brain region key in alcohol dependence and stress-related signaling. However, PTSD sufferers may have alcohol experience prior to their trauma. Here, we therefore modified our AUD/PTSD comorbidity model to provide 3 weeks of intermittent extended alcohol access before footshock and then studied the effects of NOV and FAM stress on drinking and PTSD phenotypes. NOV stress suppressed the escalation of alcohol intake and preference seen in male controls, but no stress effects were seen on drinking in females. Additionally, NOV males had decreased action potential-independent presynaptic GABA release and delayed postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor kinetics in the CeA compared to control and FAM males. Despite these changes to alcohol intake and CeA GABA signaling, stressed rats showed broadly similar anxiogenic-like behaviors to our previous comorbid model, suggesting decoupling of the PTSD symptoms from the AUD vulnerability for some of these animals. The collective results show the importance of alcohol history and trauma context in vulnerability to comorbid AUD/PTSD-like symptoms.</p>

<p>The mouse corticoreticular pathway (CRP) originates from widespread parts of the cortex, including the primary motor (M1), secondary motor (M2), anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and primary somatosensory (S1) areas. Compared with the corticospinal tract, the CRP is more distributed and bilaterally projecting, suggesting greater resilience to complete disruption.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) has been implicated as an important mediator of motor recovery and rehabilitation after central nervous system damage. However, its origins, trajectory and laterality are not well understood. This study mapped the mouse CRP in comparison with the corticospinal tract (CST). We systematically searched the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (© 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science) for experiments that used anterograde tracer injections into the right isocortex in mice. For each eligible experiment (<i>N</i> = 607), CRP and CST projection strength were quantified by the tracer volume reaching the reticular formation motor nuclei (RF<sub>motor</sub>) and pyramids, respectively. Tracer density in each brain voxel was also correlated with RF<sub>motor</sub> versus pyramids projection strength to explore the relative trajectories of the CRP and CST. We found significant CRP projections originating from the primary and secondary motor cortices, anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Compared with the CST, the CRP had stronger projections from each region except the primary somatosensory cortex. Ipsilateral projections were stronger than contralateral for both tracts (above the pyramidal decussation), but the CRP projected more bilaterally than the CST. The estimated CRP trajectory was anteromedial to the CST in the internal capsule and dorsal to the CST in the brainstem. Our findings reveal a widespread distribution of CRP origins and confirm strong bilateral CRP projections, theoretically increasing the potential for partial sparing after brain lesions and contralesional compensation after unilateral injury.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, postnatal day (PND) 1–21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.</p>

     alt="Faim knockout leads to gliosis and late-onset neurodegeneration of photoreceptors in the mouse retina"/>
<p><i>Faim</i> knockout mice present early aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, chronic gliosis, blood-retinal barrier disruption and alterations in survival pathways that culminate in photoreceptor cell death. We think FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis and a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule protein (FAIM) is a death receptor antagonist and an apoptosis regulator. It encodes two isoforms, namely FAIM-S (short) and FAIM-L (long), both with significant neuronal functions. FAIM-S, which is ubiquitously expressed, is involved in neurite outgrowth. In contrast, FAIM-L is expressed only in neurons and it protects them from cell death. Interestingly, FAIM-L is downregulated in patients and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease before the onset of neurodegeneration, and <i>Faim</i> transcript levels are decreased in mouse models of retinal degeneration. However, few studies have addressed the role of FAIM in the central nervous system, yet alone the retina. The retina is a highly specialized tissue, and its degeneration has proved to precede pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe that <i>Faim</i> depletion in mice damages the retina persistently and leads to late-onset photoreceptor death in older mice. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that <i>Faim</i> knockout (<i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) mice present ubiquitinated aggregates throughout the retina from early ages. Moreover, retinal cells released stress signals that can signal to Müller cells, as shown by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Müller cells monitor retinal homeostasis and trigger a gliotic response in <i>Faim</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice that becomes pathogenic when sustained. In this regard, we observed pronounced vascular leakage at later ages, which may be caused by persistent inflammation. These results suggest that FAIM is an important player in the maintenance of retinal homeostasis, and they support the premise that FAIM is a plausible early marker for late photoreceptor and neuronal degeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are abundant cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and are involved in processes including synapse formation/function, ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter uptake, and neurovascular coupling. Recent evidence indicates that astrocytes show diverse molecular, structural, and physiological properties within the CNS. This heterogeneity is reflected in differences in astrocyte structure, gene expression, functional properties, and responsiveness to injury/pathological conditions. Deeper investigation of astrocytic heterogeneity is needed to understand how astrocytes are configured to enable diverse roles in the CNS. While much has been learned about astrocytic heterogeneity in rodents, much less is known about astrocytic heterogeneity in the primate brain where astrocytes have greater size and complexity. The common marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) is a promising non-human primate model because of similarities between marmosets and humans with respect to genetics, brain anatomy, and cognition/behavior. Here, we investigated the molecular and structural heterogeneity of marmoset astrocytes using an array of astrocytic markers, multi-label confocal microscopy, and quantitative analysis. We used male and female marmosets and found that marmoset astrocytes show differences in expression of astrocytic markers in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These differences were accompanied by intra-regional variation in expression of markers for glutamate/GABA transporters, and potassium and water channels. Differences in astrocyte structure were also found, along with complex interactions with blood vessels, microglia, and neurons. This study contributes to our knowledge of the cellular and molecular features of marmoset astrocytes and is useful for understanding the complex properties of astrocytes in the primate CNS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder involving defective peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), due to mutation in the <i>ABCD1</i> gene. X-ALD is the most common peroxisomal inborn error of metabolism and confers a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Remarkably, a subset of patients exhibit a cerebral form with inflammatory invasion of the central nervous system and extensive demyelination, while in others only dying-back axonopathy or even isolated adrenal insufficiency is seen, without genotype–phenotype correlation. X-ALD's biochemical signature is marked elevation of VLCFAs in blood, a finding that has been utilized for massive newborn screening for early diagnosis. Investigational gene therapy approaches hold promises for improved outcomes. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain poorly understood, limiting investigation of targeted therapeutic options. Animal models for the disease recapitulate the biochemical signature of VLCFA accumulation and demonstrate mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, increased glial death, and axonal damage. Most strikingly, however, cerebral invasion of leukocytes and demyelination were not observed in any animal model for X-ALD, reflecting upon pathological processes that are yet to be discovered. This review summarizes the current disease models in animals, the lessons learned from these models, and the gaps that remained to be filled in order to assist in therapeutic investigations for ALD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Xenon is an inert gas with stable chemical properties which is used as an anesthetic. Recent <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> findings indicate that xenon also elicits an excellent neuroprotective effect in subanesthetic concentrations. The mechanisms underlying this primarily involve the attenuation of excitotoxicity and the inhibition of N-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and NMDA receptor-related effects, such as antioxidative effects, reduced activation of microglia, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms, as well as the interaction with certain ion channels and glial cells. Based on this strong neuroprotective role, a large number of experimental and clinical studies have confirmed the significant therapeutic effect of xenon in the treatment of neurological diseases. This review summarizes the reported neuroprotective mechanisms of xenon and discusses its possible therapeutic application in the treatment of various neurological diseases.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The imbalance between glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) results in the loss of synaptic strength leading to neurodegeneration. The dogma on the field considered neurons as the main players in this excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. However, current strategies focusing only on neurons have failed to completely understand this condition, bringing up the importance of glia as an alternative modulator for neuroinflammation as glia alter the activity of neurons and is a source of both neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors. This review's primary goal is to illustrate the role of glia over E/I balance in the central nervous system and its interaction with neurons. Rather than focusing only on the neuronal targets, we take a deeper look at glial receptors and proteins that could also be explored as drug targets, as they are early responders to neurotoxic insults. This review summarizes the neuron–glia interaction concerning GABA and glutamate, possible targets, and its involvement in the E/I imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>Male (M) and female (F) mice null for the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system x<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>, have neuronal structural alterations including enhanced dendritic complexity (M), decreased soma size (F), and alterations in spine head widths (M,F). These cellular morphological alterations may explain the reduction in convulsive seizure threshold demonstrated in both sexes. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>System x<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> (Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) is a heteromeric antiporter (L-cystine/L-glutamate exchanger) expressed predominately on astrocytes in the central nervous system. Its activity contributes importantly to the maintenance of the ambient extracellular glutamate levels, as well as, to cellular redox homeostasis. Since alterations in glutamate levels and redox modifications could cause structural changes, we analyzed gross regional morphology of thionin-stained brain sections and cellular and subcellular morphology of Golgi–Cox stained layer V pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex (PM1) of mice naturally null for <i>SLC7A11</i> (<i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i>)—the gene that encodes the substrate specific light chain (xCT) for Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup>. Intriguingly, in comparison to age- and sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermate controls, we found morphologic changes—including increased dendritic complexity and mushroom spine area in males and reduced corpus callosum and soma size in females—that have previously been described, in each case, as morphological correlates of excitability. Consistent with this, we found that both male and female <i>SLC7A11<sup>sut/sut</sup>
</i> mice had lower convulsive seizure thresholds and greater seizure severity than their sex-matched wild-type (<i>SLC7A11<sup>+/+</sup>
</i>) littermates after acute challenge with two pharmacologically distinct chemoconvulsants: the Glu receptor agonist, kainic acid (KA), or the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). These results suggest that the loss of Sx<sub>c</sub>
<sup>−</sup> signaling in males and females perturbs excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance <i>in vivo</i>, potentially through its regulation of cellular and subcellular morphology.</p>

<p>A human high-grade glioma (VIPI) positive for the stem cell marker nestin implanted in the brain of an immunodeficient mouse is irradiated with total 10.0 Gy split in 4 × 2.5 Gy fractions (hypofractionated radiotherapy) or 30 × 0.25 + 20 × 0.125 Gy fractions (ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy). Mice treated with the latter survive significantly longer.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>High-grade gliomas (HGGs; WHO grades III and IV) are invariably lethal brain tumors. Low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) of HGG is a well-established phenomenon <i>in vitro</i>. However, possibly linked to the unavailability of accurate animal models of the diseases, this therapeutic effect could not be consistently translated to the animal setting, thus impairing its subsequent clinical development. The purpose of this study was to develop radiotherapeutic (RT) schedules permitting to significantly improve the overall survival of faithful animal models of HGG that have been recently made available. We used primary glioma initiating cell (GIC)-driven orthotopic animal models that accurately recapitulate the heterogeneity and growth patterns of the patients' tumors, to investigate the therapeutic effects of low radiation doses toward HGG. With the same total dose, RT fractions ≤0.5 Gy twice per week [ultra-hyper-fractionation (ultra-hyper-FRT)] started at early stages of tumor progression (a condition that in the clinical setting often occurs at the end of the guidelines treatment) improved the effectiveness of RT and the animal survival in comparison to standard fractions. For the same cumulative dose, the use of fractions ≤0.5 Gy may permit to escape one or more tumor resistance mechanisms thus increasing the effectiveness of RT and the overall animal survival. These findings suggest investigating in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional RT component of the current guideline (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

     alt="Is there a relationship between EEG and sTMS neurophysiological markers of the putative human mirror neuron system?"/>
<p>In a large sample of healthy adults, we assessed whether two predominantly used measures of the human mirror neuron system (MNS) are related. Results revealed strong evidence against an association, indicating that future researchers must carefully select their measures and embrace more versatile multi-methodological approaches to indexing the MNS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been theorized to play a neurobiological role in a number of social cognitive abilities and is commonly indexed putatively in humans via interpersonal motor resonance (IMR) and mu suppression. Although both indices are thought to measure similar neuronal populations (i.e., “mirror neurons”), it has been suggested that these methods are unrelated, and therefore, incompatible. However, prior studies reporting no relationships were typically conducted in small and underpowered samples. Thus, we aimed to investigate this potential association in a large sample of neurotypical adults (<i>N</i> = 116; 72 females). Participants underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electromyography (EMG), and electroencephalography (EEG) during the observation of videos of actors performing grasping actions in order to index IMR and mu suppression (in beta, lower alpha, and upper alpha bandwidths). A series of linear regressions revealed no associations between IMR and each of the mu suppression bandwidths. Supplementary Bayesian analyses provided further evidence in favor of the null (B<sub>01</sub> = 8.85–8.93), providing further support for no association between the two indices of MNS activity. Our findings suggest that these two measures may indeed be unrelated indices that perhaps assess different neurophysiological aspects of the MNS. These results have important implications for future studies examining the MNS.</p>

     alt="Intrinsic circadian timekeeping properties of the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus"/>
<p>The lateral geniculate nucleus exhibits daily and circadian rhythms in clock gene expression. In detail, its intergeniculate leaflet and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus sustain autonomous or semi-autonomous rhythmicity, with a nocturnal rise in their spontaneous neuronal activity. However, the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus as a slave oscillator, which displays rhythmic clock gene expression only <i>in vivo</i> and does not sustain rhythmic electrical activity <i>ex vivo</i>.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circadian rhythmicity in mammals is sustained by the central brain clock—the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), entrained to the ambient light–dark conditions through a dense retinal input. However, recent discoveries of autonomous clock gene expression cast doubt on the supremacy of the SCN and suggest circadian timekeeping mechanisms devolve to local brain clocks. Here, we use a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and optogenetic tools to evaluate intrinsic clock properties of the main retinorecipient thalamic center—the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in male rats and mice. We identify the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus as a slave oscillator, which exhibits core clock gene expression exclusively <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, we provide compelling evidence for intrinsic clock gene expression accompanied by circadian variation in neuronal activity in the intergeniculate leaflet and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (VLG). Finally, our optogenetic experiments propose the VLG as a light-entrainable oscillator, whose phase may be advanced by retinal input at the beginning of the projected night. Altogether, this study for the first time demonstrates autonomous timekeeping mechanisms shaping circadian physiology of the LGN.</p>

     alt="Microstructural profiles of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness"/>
<p>Using the fixel-based analysis, we investigated white matter abnormalities of the thalamocortical connectivity in patients with disorder of consciousness. Altered connections were mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices and were mainly attributed to the microstructural changes in axonal density.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity are crucial for consciousness; however, their microstructural changes in patients with a disorder of consciousness (DOC) have not yet been thoroughly characterized. In the present study, we applied the novel fixel-based analysis to comprehensively investigate the thalamus-related microstructural abnormalities in 10 patients with DOC using 7-T diffusion-weighted imaging data. We found that compared to healthy controls, patients with DOC showed reduced fiber density (FD) and fiber density and cross-section (FDC) in the mediodorsal, anterior, and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei, while fiber-bundle cross-section (FC) was not significantly altered in the thalamus. Impaired thalamocortical connectivity in the DOC cohort was mainly connected to the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and sensorimotor cortices, including the precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus, with predominant microstructural abnormalities in FD and FDC. Correlation analysis showed that FC of the right mediodorsal thalamus was negatively correlated with the level of consciousness. Our results suggest that microstructural abnormalities of thalamus and thalamocortical connectivity in DOC were mainly attributed to axonal injury. In particular, the microstructural integrity of the thalamus is a vital factor in consciousness generation.</p>

                A large part of governmental research funding is currently distributed through the peer review of project proposals. In this paper, we argue that such funding systems incentivize and even force researchers to violate five moral values, each of which is central to commonly used scientific codes of conduct. Our argument complements existing epistemic arguments against peer-review project funding systems and, accordingly, strengthens the mounting calls for reform of these systems.

                The value-based healthcare (VBHC) concept was first proposed as a solution to many of the ills of healthcare. Since then, we have seen the term “value” defined, used, confused, and interpreted in multiple ways. While we may disagree that competition based on value will solve healthcare’s complex challenges, value is a concept integral to the future of healthcare.  Before VBHC becomes consigned to the long list of quality improvement trends and management fads that have passed through healthcare, we call for a dialogue around the term value and the implications of its different interpretations. The intention is not just to critique, but to facilitate ongoing efforts to substantially improve healthcare in ways that are relevant and sustainable for society at large.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the risk of bleeding events and potential risk factors within 90 days in patients carried <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles and received dual antiplatelet therapy after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 6,412 patients were enrolled from the Clopidogrel with aspirin in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) trial. The main outcome was any bleeding within 90 days defined by the criteria from Global Utilisation of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 250 (3.9%) bleeding events were reported, which occurred mainly within the 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (200 cases, 3.1%). Minor bleeding of the skin bruises, epistaxis, and gum bleeding was most frequent. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with increased bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.89; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Current smoking was associated with a lower risk of bleeding (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.95; <i>P</i>=0.02). Additionally, ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with higher risk of bleeding in patients aged &lt;65 years (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.95-4.22) and those without diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.88-3.73) (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.04 and 0.03, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bleeding events mostly occurred within the 21-day dual antiplatelet therapy stage and were generally mild. The risk of bleeding was greater in non-smoking patients, and was associated with treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin particularly in aged &lt;65 years and non-diabetic patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Aerobic exercise alters brain function and structure in Parkinson's disease a randomized controlled trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the cortico-striatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home-trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration: six months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise: n=25, stretching: n=31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and anti-saccades), at baseline and at six-month follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge towards the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the cortico-striatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to distinguish existing memories from similar perceptual experiences is a core feature of episodic memory. This ability is often examined using the mnemonic similarity task in which people discriminate memories of studied objects from perceptually similar lures. Studies of the neural basis of such mnemonic discrimination have mostly focused on hippocampal function and connectivity. However, default mode network (DMN) connectivity may also support such discrimination, given that the DMN includes the hippocampus, and its connectivity supports many aspects of episodic memory. Here, we used connectome-based predictive modeling to identify associations between intrinsic DMN connectivity and mnemonic discrimination. We leveraged a wide range of abilities across healthy younger and older adults to facilitate this predictive approach. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN predicted mnemonic discrimination outside the MRI scanner, especially among prefrontal and temporal regions and including several hippocampal regions. This predictive relationship was stronger for younger than older adults, primarily for temporal–prefrontal connectivity. The novel associations established here are consistent with mounting evidence that broader cortical networks including the hippocampus support mnemonic discrimination. They also suggest that age-related network disruptions undermine the extent that the DMN supports this ability. This study provides the first indication of how intrinsic functional properties of the DMN support mnemonic discrimination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal–prefrontal interactions during spatial decision‐making</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has been linked to memory encoding and spatial navigation, while the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive functions such as decision-making. These regions are hypothesized to communicate in tasks that demand both spatial navigation and decision-making processes. However, the electrophysiological signatures underlying this communication remain to be better elucidated. To investigate the dynamics of the hippocampal–prefrontal interactions, we have analyzed their local field potentials and spiking activity recorded from rats performing a spatial alternation task on a figure eight-shaped maze. We found that the phase coherence of theta peaked around the choice point area of the maze. Moreover, Granger causality revealed a hippocampus → prefrontal cortex directionality of information flow at theta frequency, peaking at starting areas of the maze, and on the reverse direction at delta frequency, peaking near the turn onset. Additionally, the patterns of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling within and between the regions also showed spatial selectivity, and hippocampal theta and prefrontal delta modulated not only gamma amplitude but also inter-regional gamma synchrony. Finally, we found that the theta rhythm dynamically modulated neurons in both regions, with the highest modulation at the choice area; interestingly, prefrontal cortex neurons were more strongly modulated by the hippocampal theta rhythm than by their local field rhythm. In all, our results reveal maximum electrophysiological interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex near the decision-making period of the spatial alternation task, corroborating the hypothesis that a dynamic interplay between these regions takes place during spatial decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic (M1) cholinergic receptor activation within the dorsal hippocampus promotes destabilization of strongly encoded object location memories</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the initial consolidation process, memories can become reactivated by exposure to a reminder of the original learning event. This can lead to the memory becoming destabilized and vulnerable to disruption or other forms of modification. The memory must then undergo the protein-synthesis dependent process of reconsolidation in order to be retained. However, older and/or stronger memories resist destabilization, but can become labile when reactivated in the presence of salient novelty. We have implicated the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acting at M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) within perirhinal cortex (PRh), in novelty-induced destabilization of remote object memories. It remains unclear, however, whether mAChRs are involved in destabilization of other forms of memory. We hypothesized that the role of M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs previously demonstrated for PRh-dependent object memory would extend to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Using the object location (OL) task, which relies on the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), we showed that (a) reactivation-dependent reconsolidation of OL memories requires protein synthesis within the dHPC; (b) destabilization of relatively weak OL memories depends on M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC; (c) salient novelty during reactivation promotes destabilization of resistant strongly encoded OL memories; (d) novelty-induced destabilization of strong OL memories requires activation of mAChRs within the dHPC; and (e) M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC in the absence of novelty during memory reactivation mimics the effect of novelty, destabilizing strongly encoded OL memories. These results implicate ACh acting at M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs in the destabilization of dHPC-dependent spatial memories, demonstrating generalizability of this cholinergic function beyond memory for object identity. These findings therefore enhance our understanding of the dynamics of long-term memory storage and suggest implications for the treatment of human conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are characterized by behavioral and mnemonic inflexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">London taxi drivers: A review of neurocognitive studies and an exploration of how they build their cognitive map of London</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Licensed London taxi drivers have been found to show changes in the gray matter density of their hippocampus over the course of training and decades of navigation in London (UK). This has been linked to their learning and using of the “<i>Knowledge of London</i>,” the names and layout of over 26,000 streets and thousands of points of interest in London. Here we review past behavioral and neuroimaging studies of London taxi drivers, covering the structural differences in hippocampal gray matter density and brain dynamics associated with navigating London. We examine the process by which they learn the layout of London, detailing the key learning steps: systematic study of maps, travel on selected overlapping routes, the mental visualization of places and the optimal use of subgoals. Our analysis provides the first map of the street network covered by the routes used to learn the network, allowing insight into where there are gaps in this network. The methods described could be widely applied to aid spatial learning in the general population and may provide insights for artificial intelligence systems to efficiently learn new environments.</p>

                Human MAIT cells sit at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, are polyfunctional and are capable of killing pathogen infected cells via recognition of the Class IB molecule MR1. MAIT cells have recently been shown to possess an antiviral protective role <i>in vivo</i> and we therefore sought to explore this in relation to HIV-1 infection. There was marked activation of MAIT cells <i>in vivo</i> in HIV-1 infected individuals, which decreased following ART. Stimulation of THP1 monocytes with R5 tropic HIV<sub>BAL</sub> potently activated MAIT cells <i>in vitro. </i>This activation was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18 but was independent of the TCR. Upon activation, MAIT cells were able to up-regulate granzyme B, IFNg and HIV-1 restriction factors CCL3, 4 and 5. Restriction factors produced by MAIT cells inhibited HIV-1 infection of primary PBMCs and immortalized target cells <i>in vitro</i>. These data reveal MAIT cells to be an additional T cell population responding to HIV-1, with a potentially important role in controlling viral replication at mucosal sites.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">De novo synthesized polyunsaturated fatty acids operate as both host immunomodulators and nutrients for Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Successful control of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) infection by macrophages relies on immunometabolic reprogramming, where the role of fatty acids (FAs) remains poorly understood. Recent studies unraveled Mtb's capacity to acquire saturated and monounsaturated FAs via the Mce1 importer. However upon activation, macrophages produce polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), mammal-specific FAs mediating the generation of immunomodulatory eicosanoids. Here, we asked how Mtb modulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of PUFAs in primary mouse macrophages and whether this benefits host or pathogen. Quantitative lipidomics revealed that Mtb infection selectively activates the biosynthesis of w6 PUFAs upstream of the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid (AA), via transcriptional activation of <i>Fads2</i>. Inhibiting FADS2 in infected macrophages impaired their inflammatory and antimicrobial responses but had no effect on Mtb growth in mice. Using a click-chemistry approach, we found that Mtb efficiently imports w6 PUFAs via Mce1 in axenic culture, including AA. Further, Mtb preferentially internalized AA over all other FAs within infected macrophages, by mechanisms partially depending on Mce1 and supporting intracellular persistence. Notably, IFNγ repressed <i>de novo</i> synthesis of AA by infected mouse macrophages and restricted AA import by intracellular Mtb. Together, these findings identify AA as a major FA substrate for intracellular Mtb, whose mobilization by innate immune responses is opportunistically hijacked by the pathogen and downregulated by IFNγ.

                Tight junctions (TJs) between blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells construct a robust physical barrier, whose damage underlies BBB dysfunctions related to several neurodegenerative diseases. What makes these highly specialized BBB-TJs extremely restrictive remains unknown. Here, we use super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM) to uncover new structural and functional properties of BBB TJs. Focusing on three major components, Nano-scale resolution revealed sparse (occludin) vs. clustered (ZO1/claudin-5) molecular architecture. In mouse development, permeable TJs become first restrictive to large molecules, and only later to small molecules, with claudin-5 proteins arrangement compacting during this maturation process. Mechanistically, we reveal that ZO1 clustering is independent of claudin-5<i> in-vivo</i>. In contrast to accepted knowledge, we found that in the developmental context, total levels of claudin-5 inversely correlate with TJ functionality. Our super-resolution studies provide a unique perspective of BBB TJs and open new directions for understanding TJ functionality in biological barriers, ultimately enabling restoration in disease or modulation for drug delivery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Novel mechanistic insights into the role of Mer2 as the keystone of meiotic DNA break formation</a></h4>

              
                In meiosis, DNA double strand break (DSB) formation by Spo11 initiates recombination and enables chromosome segregation. Numerous factors are required for Spo11 activity, and couple the DSB machinery to the development of a meiosis-specific “axis-tethered loop” chromosome organization. Through <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution and budding yeast genetics we here provide architectural insight into the DSB machinery by focussing on a foundational DSB factor, Mer2. We characterise the interaction of Mer2 with the histone reader Spp1, and show that Mer2 directly associates to nucleosomes, likely highlighting a contribution of Mer2 to tethering DSB factors to chromatin. We reveal the biochemical basis of Mer2 association with Hop1, a HORMA domain-containing chromosomal axis factor. Finally, we identify a conserved region within Mer2 crucial for DSB activity, and show that this region of Mer2 interacts with the DSB factor Mre11. In combination with previous work, we establish Mer2 as a keystone of the DSB machinery by bridging key protein complexes involved in the initiation of meiotic recombination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure and ion-release mechanism of PIB-4-type ATPases</a></h4>

              
                Transition metals, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients in all organisms, but also highly toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy-metal transporting P-type (P<sub>IB</sub>) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. No structural information is available for the P<sub>IB-4</sub>-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest cargo scope, and hence even their topology remains elusive. Here we present structures and complementary functional analyses of an archetypal P<sub>IB‑4</sub>‑ATPase, sCoaT from <i>Sulfitobacter sp.</i> <i>NAS14-1</i>. The data disclose the architecture, devoid of classical so-called heavy metal binding domains, and provides fundamentally new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. We reveal several novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. We also establish that the turn-over of P<sub>IB</sub>‑ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. Combined with new inhibitory compounds, our results open up for efforts in e.g. drug discovery, since P<sub>IB-4</sub>-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamic decision policy reconfiguration under outcome uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                In uncertain or unstable environments, sometimes the best decision is to change your mind. To shed light on this flexibility, we evaluated how the underlying decision policy adapts when the most rewarding action changes. Human participants performed a dynamic two-armed bandit task that manipulated the certainty in relative reward (conflict) and the reliability of action-outcomes (volatility). Continuous estimates of conflict and volatility contributed to shifts in exploratory states by changing both the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and the amount of evidence needed to make a decision (boundary height), respectively. At the trialwise level, following a switch in the optimal choice, the drift rate plummets and the boundary height weakly spikes, leading to a slow exploratory state. We find that the drift rate drives most of this response, with an unreliable contribution of boundary height across experiments. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that pupillary responses associated with decision policy changes. We conclude that humans show a stereotypical shift in their decision policies in response to environmental changes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A modular platform for automated cryo-FIB workflows</a></h4>

              
                Lamella micromachining by focused ion beam milling at cryogenic temperature (cryo-FIB) has matured into a preparation method widely used for cellular cryo-electron tomography. Due to the limited ablation rates of low Ga<sup>+</sup> ion beam currents required to maintain the structural integrity of vitreous specimens, common preparation protocols are time-consuming and labor intensive. The improved stability of new generation cryo-FIB instruments now enables automated operations. Here, we present an open-source software tool, SerialFIB, for creating automated and customizable cryo-FIB preparation protocols. The software encompasses a graphical user interface for easy execution of routine lamellae preparations, a scripting module compatible with available Python packages, and interfaces with 3-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) tools. SerialFIB enables the streamlining of advanced cryo-FIB protocols such as multi-modal imaging, CLEM-guided lamella preparation and <i>in situ</i> lamella lift-out procedures. Our software therefore provides a foundation for further development of advanced cryogenic imaging and sample preparation protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hyaluronic acid fuels pancreatic cancer cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Rewired metabolism is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA). Previously, we demonstrated that PDA cells enhance glycosylation precursor biogenesis through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) via activation of the rate limiting enzyme, glutamine-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 (GFAT1). Here, we genetically ablated GFAT1 in human PDA cell lines, which completely blocked proliferation in vitro and led to cell death. In contrast, GFAT1 knockout did not preclude the growth of human tumor xenografts in mice, suggesting that cancer cells can maintain fidelity of glycosylation precursor pools by scavenging nutrients from the tumor microenvironment. We found that hyaluronic acid (HA), an abundant carbohydrate polymer in pancreatic tumors composed of repeating N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid sugars, can bypass GFAT1 to refuel the HBP via the GlcNAc salvage pathway. Together, these data show HA can serve as a nutrient fueling PDA metabolism beyond its previously appreciated structural and signaling roles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dual endosymbiosis supports nutritional adaptation to hematophagy in the invasive tick Hyalomma marginatum</a></h4>

              
                Many animals are dependent on microbial partners that provide essential nutrients lacking from their diet. Ticks, whose diet consists exclusively on vertebrate blood, rely on maternally inherited bacterial symbionts to supply B vitamins. While previously studied tick species consistently harbor a single lineage of those nutritional symbionts, we evidence here that the invasive tick <i>Hyalomma marginatum</i> harbors a unique dual-partner nutritional system between an ancestral symbiont, <i>Francisella</i>, and a more recently acquired symbiont, <i>Midichloria</i>. Using metagenomics, we show that <i>Francisella</i> exhibits extensive genome erosion that endangers the nutritional symbiotic interactions. Its genome includes folate and riboflavin biosynthesis pathways but deprived functional biotin biosynthesis on account of massive pseudogenization. Co-symbiosis compensates this deficiency since the <i>Midichloria</i> genome encompasses an intact biotin operon, which was primarily acquired via lateral gene transfer from unrelated intracellular bacteria commonly infecting arthropods. Thus, in <i>H. marginatum</i>, a mosaic of co-evolved symbionts incorporating gene combinations of distant phylogenetic origins emerged to prevent the collapse of an ancestral nutritional symbiosis. Such dual endosymbiosis was never reported in other blood feeders but was recently documented in agricultural pests feeding on plant sap, suggesting that it may be a key mechanism for advanced adaptation of arthropods to specialized diets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular determinants of phase separation for Drosophila DNA replication licensing factors</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in proteins can drive the formation of membraneless compartments in cells. Phase-separated structures enrich for specific partner proteins and exclude others. Previously, we showed that the IDRs of metazoan DNA replication initiators drive DNA-dependent phase separation <i>in vitro</i> and chromosome binding <i>in vivo</i>, and that initiator condensates selectively recruit replication-specific partner proteins (Parker et al., 2019). How initiator IDRs facilitate LLPS and maintain compositional specificity is unknown. Here, using <i>D. melanogaster (Dm)</i> Cdt1 as a model initiation factor, we show that phase separation results from a synergy between electrostatic DNA-bridging interactions and hydrophobic inter-IDR contacts. Both sets of interactions depend on sequence composition (but not sequence order), are resistant to 1,6-hexanediol, and do not depend on aromaticity. These findings demonstrate that distinct sets of interactions drive condensate formation and specificity across different phase-separating systems and advance efforts to predict IDR LLPS propensity and partner selection <i>a priori</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Investigating disagreement in the scientific literature</a></h4>

              
                Disagreement is essential to scientific progress but the extent of disagreement in science, its evolution over time, and the fields in which it happens remain poorly understood. Here we report the development of an approach based on cue phrases that can identify instances of disagreement in scientific articles. These instances are sentences in an article that cite other articles. Applying this approach to a collection of more than four million English-language articles published between 2000 and 2015 period, we determine the level of disagreement in five broad fields within the scientific literature (biomedical and health sciences; life and earth sciences; mathematics and computer science; physical sciences and engineering; and social sciences and humanities) and 817 meso-level fields. Overall, the level of disagreement is highest in the social sciences and humanities, and lowest in mathematics and computer science. However, there is considerable heterogeneity across the meso-level fields, revealing the importance of local disciplinary cultures and the epistemic characteristics of disagreement. Analysis at the level of individual articles reveals notable episodes of disagreement in science, and illustrates how methodological artifacts can confound analyses of scientific texts.

                Fast and accurately characterizing animal behaviors is crucial for neuroscience research. Deep learning models are efficiently used in the laboratories for behavior analysis. However, it has not been achieved to use a fully unsupervised method to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from raw behavior video frames for annotation and analysis purposes. Here, we report a self supervised feature extraction (Selfee) convolutional neural network with multiple downstream applications to process video frames of animal behavior in an end to end way. Visualization and classification of the extracted features (Meta representations) validate that Selfee processes animal behaviors in a comparable way of human understanding. We demonstrate that Meta representations can be efficiently used to detect anomalous behaviors that are indiscernible to human observation and hint in depth analysis. Furthermore, time series analyses of Meta representations reveal the temporal dynamics of animal behaviors. In conclusion, we present a self supervised learning approach to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from raw video recordings of animal behaviors and demonstrate its potential usage for various downstream applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of individual odor preference in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Behavior varies even among genetically identical animals raised in the same environment. However, little is known about the circuit or anatomical underpinnings of this individuality. Drosophila olfaction is an ideal system for discovering the origins of behavioral individuality among genetically identical individuals. The fly olfactory circuit is well-characterized and stereotyped, yet stable idiosyncrasies in odor preference, neural coding, and neural wiring are present and may be relevant to behavior. Using paired behavior and two-photon imaging measurements, we show that individual odor preferences in odor-vs-air and odor-vs-odor assays are predicted by idiosyncratic calcium dynamics in Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) and Projection Neurons (PNs), respectively. This suggests that circuit variation at the sensory periphery determines individual odor preferences. Furthermore, paired behavior and immunohistochemistry measurements reveal that variation in ORN presynaptic density also predicts odor-vs-odor preference. This point in the olfactory circuit appears to be a locus of individuality where microscale variation gives rise to idiosyncratic behavior. To unify these results, we constructed a leaky-integrate-and-fire model of 3,062 neurons in the antennal lobe. In these simulations, stochastic fluctuations at the glomerular level, like those observed in our ORN immunohistochemistry, produce variation in PN calcium responses with the same structure as we observed experimentally, the very structure that predicts idiosyncratic behavior. Thus, our results demonstrate how minute physiological and structural variations in a neural circuit may produce individual behavior, even when genetics and environment are held constant.

                The neurobiological mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use, a cardinal feature of alcohol use disorder, remain elusive even though they have often been suggested to involve dopamine (DA). Here, we found that rats expressing compulsive alcohol-related behavior, operationalized as punishment-resistant self-administration, showed a decrease in DA levels restricted to the dorsolateral territories of the striatum, the main output structure of the nigrostriatal DA pathway. We then causally demonstrated that a chemogenetic-induced selective hypodopaminergia of this pathway results in compulsive alcohol self-administration in rats otherwise resilient, accompanied by the emergence of alcohol withdrawal-like motivational impairments. These results demonstrate a major implication of tonic nigrostriatal hypodopaminergic state in alcohol addiction and provide new insights into our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pharmacological blockade of muscle afferents and perception of effort: a systematic review with meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The perception of effort (PE) provides information on task difficulty and influences physical exercise regulation and human behavior. This perception differs from other-exercise related perceptions such as pain. There is no consensus on the role of group III-IV muscle afferents as a signal processed by the brain to generate PE. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of pharmacologically blocking muscle afferents on the PE. Six databases were searched to identify studies measuring the ratings of perceived effort (RPE) during physical exercise, with and without pharmacological blockade of muscle afferents. Articles were coded based on the operational measurement used to distinguish studies in which PE was assessed specifically (effort dissociated) or as a composite experience including other exercise-related perceptions (effort not dissociated). Articles that did not provide enough information for coding were assigned to the unclear group. The effort dissociated group (n=6) demonstrated a slight RPE increase with reduced muscle afferents feedback (standard mean change raw (SMCR), 0.39; 95%CI, 0.13 to 0.64). The group effort not dissociated (n=2) did not reveal conclusive results (SMCR, -0.29; 95%CI, -2.39 to 1.8). The group unclear (n=8) revealed a slight RPE decrease with reduced muscle afferents feedback (SMCR, -0.27; 95%CI, -0.50 to -0.04). The heterogeneity in results between groups reveals that the inclusion of other perceptions than effort in its rating influences the RPE scores reported by the participants. The absence of decreased RPE in the effort dissociated group suggests that muscle afferents feedback is not a sensory signal generating PE.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced learning and sensory salience in a cerebellar mouse autism model</a></h4>

              
                Among the impairments manifested by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are sometimes islands of enhanced function. Although neuronal mechanisms for enhanced functions in ASD are unknown, the cerebellum is a major site of developmental alteration, and early-life perturbation to it leads to ASD with higher likelihood than any other brain region. Here we report that a cerebellum-specific transgenic mouse model of ASD shows faster learning on a sensory evidence-accumulation task. In addition, transgenic mice showed enhanced sensitivity to touch and auditory cues, and prolonged electrophysiological responses in Purkinje-cell complex spikes and associative neocortical regions. These findings were replicated by pairing cues with optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells. Computational latent-state analysis of behavior revealed that both groups of mice with cerebellar perturbations exhibited enhanced focus on current rather than past information, consistent with a role for the cerebellum in retaining information in memory. We conclude that cerebellar perturbation can activate neocortex via complex spike activity and reduce reliance on prior experience, consistent with a weak-central-coherence account in which ASD traits arise from enhanced detail-oriented processing. This recasts ASD not so much as a disorder but as a variation that, in particular niches, can be adaptive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A personalizable autonomous neural mass model of epileptic seizures</a></h4>

              
                The prospect of personalized computational modeling in neurological disorders, and in particular in epilepsy, is poised to revolutionize the field. Work in the last two decades has demonstrated that neural mass models (NMM) can realistically reproduce and explain epileptic seizure transitions as recorded by electrophysiological methods (EEG, SEEG). In previous work, advances were achieved by i) increasing excitation in NMM and ii) heuristically varying network inhibitory coupling parameters or, equivalently, inhibitory synaptic gains. Based on those studies, we provide here a laminar neural mass model capable of realistically reproducing the electrical activity recorded by SEEG in the epileptogenic zone during interictal to ictal states. With the exception of the external noise input onto the pyramidal cell population, the model dynamics are autonomous --- all model parameters are static. By setting the system at a point close to bifurcation, seizure-like transitions are generated, including pre-ictal spikes, low voltage fast activity, and ictal rhythmic activity. A novel element in the model is a physiologically plausible algorithm for chloride accumulation dynamics: the gain of GABAergic post-synaptic potentials is modulated by the pathological accumulation of Cl$^-$ in pyramidal cells, due to high inhibitory input and/or dysfunctional chloride transport. In addition, in order to simulate SEEG signals to compare with real recordings performed in epileptic patients, the NMM is embedded first in a layered model of the neocortex and then in a realistic physical model. We compare modeling results with data from four epilepsy patient cases. By including key pathophysiological mechanisms, the proposed framework captures succinctly the electrophysiological phenomenology observed in ictal states, paving the way for robust personalization methods using brain network models based on NMMs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pattern and component responses of primate MT neurons recorded with multi-contact electrodes, stimulated with 1D and 2D noise patterns.</a></h4>

              
                Direction selective neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) are affected by the aperture problem, i.e., they are only sensitive to motion orthogonal to their preferred orientation. A solution to this problem first emerges in the middle temporal (MT) area, where a subset of neurons (called pattern cells) combine motion information across multiple orientations and directions, becoming sensitive to pattern motion direction. These cells are expected to play a prominent role in subsequent neural processing, but they are intermixed with cells that behave like V1 cells (component cells), and others that do not clearly fall in either group. The picture is further complicated by the finding that cells that behave like pattern cells with one type of pattern, might behave like component cells for another. We recorded from macaque MT neurons using multi-contact electrodes while presenting both type I and unikinetic plaids, in which the components were 1D noise patterns. We found that the indices that have been used in the past to classify neurons as pattern or component cells work poorly when the properties of the stimulus are not optimized for the cell being recorded, as is always the case with multi-contact arrays. We thus propose alternative measures, which considerably ameliorate the problem, and allow us to gain insights in the signals carried by individual MT neurons. We conclude that arranging cells along a component-to-pattern continuum is an oversimplification, and that the signals carried by individual cells only make sense when embodied in larger populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiplex, translaminar imaging in the spinal cord of behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                While the spinal cord is known to play critical roles in sensorimotor processing, including pain-related signaling, corresponding activity patterns in genetically defined cell types across spinal laminae have remained elusive. Calcium imaging has enabled cellular activity measurements in behaving rodents but is currently limited to superficial regions. Using chronically implanted microprisms, we imaged sensory and motor evoked activity in regions and at speeds inaccessible by other high-resolution imaging techniques. To enable translaminar imaging in freely behaving animals through implanted microprisms, we additionally developed wearable microscopes with custom-compound microlenses. This new integrated system addresses multiple challenges of previous wearable microscopes, including their limited working distance, resolution, contrast, and achromatic range. The combination of these innovations allowed us to uncover that dorsal horn astrocytes in behaving mice show somatosensory program-dependent and lamina-specific calcium excitation. Additionally, we show that tachykinin precursor 1 (Tac1)-expressing neurons exhibit upper laminae-restricted activity to acute mechanical pain but not locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excess interictal activity marks seizure prone cortical areas and mice in a genetic epilepsy model</a></h4>

              
                Genetic epilepsies are often caused by variants in widely expressed genes, potentially impacting numerous brain regions and functions. For instance, gain-of-function (GOF) variants in the widely expressed Na+-activated K+ channel gene KCNT1 alter basic neurophysiological and synaptic properties of cortical neurons, leading to developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Yet, aside from causing seizures, little is known about how such variants reshape interictal brain activity, and how this relates to epileptic activity and other disease symptoms. To address this knowledge gap, we monitored neural activity across the dorsal cortex in a mouse model of human KCNT1-related epilepsy using in vivo, awake widefield Ca2+ imaging. We observed 52 spontaneous seizures and 1700 interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in homozygous mutant (Kcnt1m/m) mice, allowing us to map their appearance and spread at high spatial resolution. Outside of seizures and IEDs, we detected ~46,000 events, representing interictal cortical activity, in both Kcnt1m/m and wild-type (WT) mice, and we classified them according to their spatial profiles. Spontaneous seizures and IEDs emerged within a consistent set of susceptible cortical areas, and seizures propagated both contiguously and non-contiguously within these areas in a manner influenced, but not fully determined, by underlying synaptic connectivity. Seizure emergence was predicted by a progressive concentration of total cortical activity within the impending seizure emergence zone. Outside of seizures and IEDs, similar events were detected in WT and Kcnt1m/m mice, suggesting that the spatial structure of interictal activity was largely preserved. Several features of these events, however, were altered in Kcnt1m/m mice. Most event types were briefer, and their intensity more variable, across Kcnt1m/m mice; mice showing more intense activity spent more time in seizure. Furthermore, the rate of events whose spatial profile overlapped with where seizures and IEDs emerged was increased in Kcnt1m/m mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an epilepsy-causing K+ channel variant broadly alters physiology. Yet, outside of seizures and IEDs, it acts not to produce novel types of cortical activity, but rather to modulate its amount. The areas where seizures and IEDs emerge show excessively frequent and intense interictal activity and the mean intensity of an individual's cortical activity predicts its seizure burden. These findings provide critical guidance for targeting future research and therapy development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of bi-directionally coupled self-organizing neurovascular networks captures orientation-selective neural and hemodynamic cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                The network of neurons in the brain is considered the primary substrate of information processing. Despite growing evidence on the possible role of cerebral blood flow in information processing, the cerebrovascular network is generally viewed as an irrigation system that ensures a timely supply of oxygen, glucose, and nutrients to the neural tissue. However, a recent study has shown that cerebral microvessels, like neurons, also exhibit tuned responses to sensory stimuli. Tuned neural responses to sensory stimuli are certainly enhanced with experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity and other forms of learning. Hence it is possible that the densely interconnected microvascular network might also be subject to some form of plasticity or competitive learning rules during early postnatal development such that its fine-scale structure becomes optimized for metabolic delivery to a given neural micro-architecture. To explore the possibility of adaptive lateral interactions and tuned responses in cerebral microvessels, we modeled the cortical neurovascular network by interconnecting two laterally connected self-organizing networks (Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map - LISSOM). The afferent and lateral connections of the LISSOM were defined by trainable weights. By varying the topology of lateral connectivity in the vascular network layer, we observed that the partial correspondence of feature selectivity between neural and hemodynamic responses could be explained by lateral coupling across local blood vessels such that the central domain receives an excitatory drive of more blood flow and a more distal surrounding region where blood flow is reduced. Critically, our simulations suggest a new role for feedback from the vascular to the neural network because the radius of vascular perfusion seems to determine whether the cortical neural map develops into a clustered and columnar vs. salt-and-pepper organization.

                Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that enables observation of metabolites. Applications of MRSI for neuroimaging applications has shown promise for monitoring and detecting various diseases. This study builds off previously developed techniques of short TR, 1H FID MRSI by correcting for T1-weighting of the metabolites and utilizing an internal water reference to produce quantitative (mmol kg-1) metabolite maps. This work reports and shows quantitative metabolite maps for 12 metabolites for a single slice. Voxel-specific T1-corrections for water are common in MRSI studies; however, most studies use either averaged T1-relaxation times to correct for T1-weighting of metabolites or omit this correction step entirely. This work employs the use of voxel-specific T1-corrections for metabolites in addition to water. Utilizing averaged T1-relaxation times for metabolites can bias metabolite maps for metabolites that have strong differences between T1-relaxation for GM and WM (i.e. Glu). This work systematically compares quantitative metabolite maps to single voxel quantitative results and qualitatively compares metabolite maps to previous works.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypersensitivity to uncertainty is key feature of subjective cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                With an increasingly ageing global population, more people are presenting with concerns about their cognitive function, but not all have an underlying neurodegenerative diagnosis. Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) is a common condition describing self-reported deficits in cognition without objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Many individuals with SCI suffer from depression and anxiety, which have been hypothesised to account for their cognitive complaints. Despite this association between SCI and affective features, the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying SCI are poorly understood. Here, we show that people with SCI are hypersensitive to uncertainty and that this might be a key mechanism accounting for their affective burden. Twenty-seven individuals with SCI performed an information sampling task, where they could actively gather information prior to decisions. Across different conditions, SCI participants sampled faster and obtained more information than matched controls to resolve uncertainty. Remarkably, despite their "urgent" sampling behaviour, SCI participants were able to maintain their efficiency. Hypersensitivity to uncertainty indexed by this sampling behaviour correlated with the severity of affective burden including depression and anxiety. Analysis of MRI resting functional connectivity revealed that both uncertainty hypersensitivity and affective burden were associated with stronger insular-hippocampal connectivity. These results suggest that altered uncertainty processing is a key mechanism underlying the psycho-cognitive manifestations in SCI and implicate a specific brain network target for future treatment.

Prior evidence suggests that apnea onset can coincide with seizure spread to the amygdala and that stimulation of the amygdala can reliably induce apneas in epilepsy patients, potentially implicating amygdalar regions in seizure-related respiratory arrest and subsequent postictal hypoventilation and cardiorespiratory death. This study aimed to determine if an extended amygdalar structure, the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST), is involved in seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) and death using DBA/1 mice, a mouse strain which has audiogenic seizures and a high incidence of postictal respiratory arrest and death. The presence of S-IRA significantly increased c-Fos expression in the dBNST of DBA/1 mice. Furthermore, disruption of synaptic output from the dBNST via viral-induced tetanus neurotoxin significantly improved survival following S-IRA in DBA/1 mice without affecting baseline breathing or hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory response. This disruption in the dBNST resulted in changes to the balance of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic events in the downstream brainstem regions of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). These findings suggest that the dBNST is a potential subcortical forebrain site necessary for the mediation of seizure-induced respiratory arrest, potentially through its outputs to brainstem respiratory regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An extended toolkit for production and use of RVdG-CVS-N2c rabies viral vectors uncovers hidden hippocampal connections</a></h4>

              
                From the large collection of molecular tools used to investigate neuronal connectivity, envA-pseudotyped rabies viral vectors (RVdGenvA) uniquely enable cell-type specific, trans-synaptic retrograde labeling. However, widespread use of the powerful and flexible method is to date hindered by low-yield and cumbersome production pipelines. Here, we report the development of new cell lines, which significantly reduce production time while increasing viral titer and eliminating background contamination from native-coat particles. We further show that RVdGenvA-CVS-N2c vectors produced using this system retain their enhanced retrograde-trafficking when compared with SAD-B19 vectors, allowing us to uncover undescribed cortico-hippocampal connections and to monitor activity in a cortical microcircuit of behaving animals. Along with new suites of AAV and RVdG-CVS-N2c vectors, developed to enable retrograde labeling from a wide range of neuronal populations and tailored for diverse experimental requirements, we present here an optimal system for mapping, manipulating and imaging of neuronal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astroglial CD38 regulates social memory and synapse formation through SPARCL1 in the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Social behavior is essential for the health, survival and reproduction of animals, yet the role of astrocytes in social behavior is largely unknown. CD38 is critical for social behaviors by regulating oxytocin release from hypothalamic neurons. On the other hand, CD38 is most abundantly expressed in astrocytes especially in the postnatal cortex, and is important for astroglial development. Here, we demonstrate that astroglial CD38 plays a pivotal role in the social behavior. Selective deletion of CD38 in postnatal astrocytes, but not in adult astrocytes, specifically impaired social memory without any other behavioral abnormalities. Morphological analysis revealed reductions in spine numbers, mature spines and excitatory synapse numbers in the pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) due to deletion of astroglial CD38 in the postnatal brain. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) of CD38 KO astrocytes reduced synaptogenesis of cortical neurons by reducing extracellular SPARCL1, a synaptogenic protein. Finally, the release of SPARCL1 from astrocytes is regulated by CD38/cADPR/calcium signaling. Our data indicate that astroglial CD38 developmentally regulates social memory and neural circuit formation in the developing brain by promoting synaptogenesis through SPARCL1.

	<p>Background: Subcallosal artery infarction injures the fornix and anterior corpus callosum and sometimes causes Korsakoff&amp;amp;rsquo;s amnesia. We hypothesized that Korsakoff&amp;amp;rsquo;s amnesia might be caused by fornix dysfunction rather than anterior corpus callosum dysfunction in subcallosal artery infarction. Methods: A systematic review approach was applied to search PubMed and Google Scholar for articles to compare patients who had both bilateral fornix and corpus callosum infarction due to subcallosal artery territory ischemia (vascular event group; V group) with patients who had undergone anterior corpus callosotomy (callosotomy group; C group). Results: The V group comprised 10 patients (mean age, 63 years; median, 69 years; standard deviation (SD), 14.5 years; 5 males, 5 females). The C group comprised 6 patients (mean age, 23.7 years; median, 20 years; SD, 7.3 years; 3 males, 3 females). Six of 10 patients (60%) with subcallosal artery infarction exhibited Korsakoff&amp;amp;rsquo;s amnesia. One patient showed neither confabulation nor amnesia. Conversely, no amnesia episodes were seen in any patients from the C group (p = 0.034). Conclusion: Fornix injury, rather than anterior corpus callosum injury, might be the major cause of Korsakoff&amp;amp;rsquo;s amnesia in patients with subcallosal artery infarction.</p>

	<p>Background: To quantify development of gaze stability throughout life during short and long fixational tasks using eye tracking technology. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-nine participants aged between 5 months and 77 years were recruited along the study. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological assessment. Fixational behavior during long and short fixational tasks was analyzed using a DIVE (Device for an Integral Visual Examination), a digital test assisted with eye tracking technology. The participants were divided into ten groups according to their age. Group 1, 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 years; group 2, 2&amp;amp;ndash;5 years; group 3, 5&amp;amp;ndash;10 years; group 4, 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 years; group 5, 20&amp;amp;ndash;30 years; group 6, 30&amp;amp;ndash;40 years; group 7, 40&amp;amp;ndash;50 years; group 8, 50&amp;amp;ndash;60 years; group 9, 60&amp;amp;ndash;70 years; and group 10, over 70 years. Results: Gaze stability, assessed by logBCEA (log-transformed bivariate contour ellipse area), improved with age from 5 months to 30 years (1.27 vs. 0.57 deg2 for long fixational task, 0.73 vs. &amp;amp;minus;0.04 deg2 for short fixational task), while fixations tend to be longer (1.95 vs. 2.80 msec for long fixational tasks and 0.80 vs. 1.71 msec for short fixational tasks). All fixational outcomes worsened progressively from the fifth decade of life. Log-transformed bivariate contour ellipse area (0.79, 0.83, 0.91, 1.42 deg2 for long fixational task and 0.01, 0.18, 0.28, 0.44 deg2 for short fixational task, for group 7, 8, 9, and 10 respectively). Stimuli features may influence oculomotor performance, with smaller stimuli providing prolonged fixations. Conclusions: Fixational behavior can be accurately assessed from 5 months of age using a DIVE. We report normative data of gaze stability and duration of fixations for every age group. Currently available technology may increase the accuracy of our visual assessments at any age.</p>

	<p>Scene construction refers to the process by which humans generate richly detailed and spatially cohesive scenes in the mind&amp;amp;rsquo;s eye. The cognitive processes that underwrite this capacity remain unclear, particularly when the envisaged scene calls for the integration of various types of contextual information. Here, we explored social and non-social forms of scene construction in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD; n = 11) and the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n = 15) relative to healthy older control participants (n = 16) using a novel adaptation of the scene construction task. Participants mentally constructed detailed scenes in response to scene&amp;amp;ndash;object cues that varied in terms of their sociality (social; non-social) and congruence (congruent; incongruent). A significant group &amp;amp;times; sociality &amp;amp;times; congruence interaction was found whereby performance on the incongruent social scene condition was significantly disrupted in both patient groups relative to controls. Moreover, bvFTD patients produced significantly less contextual detail in social relative to non-social incongruent scenes. Construction of social and non-social incongruent scenes in the patient groups combined was significantly associated with independent measures of semantic processing and visuospatial memory. Our findings demonstrate the influence of schema-incongruency on scene construction performance and reinforce the importance of episodic&amp;amp;ndash;semantic interactions during novel event construction.</p>

	<p>Pathogenic variants of the SCN2A gene (MIM 182390) are associated with several epileptic syndromes ranging from benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNIS) to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. The aim of this work was to describe clinical features among five patients with concomitant SCN2A gene variants and cryptogenic epileptic syndromes, thus expanding the SCN2A spectrum of phenotypic heterogeneity. De novo variants were identified in four patients, while one inherited variant was identified in a patient with an unaffected carrier biological father with somatic mosaicism. Two of five patients were diagnosed with a neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. The remaining three patients manifested a focal epileptic syndrome associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) or with a variable degree of intellectual disability (ID), one of them displaying a hitherto unreported atypical late onset epilepsy. Overall, the pattern of clinical manifestations among these patients suggest that any observed neurological impairment may not be directly related to the severity of the electroclinical pattern, but instead likely associated with the mutation itself. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of SCN2A mutational screening in cases of ID/ASD with or without epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Studies performed across the COVID-19 pandemic waves point to the persistent impact of the pandemic on sleep and mental health. We expand these data by examining insomnia, pre-sleep arousal, psychosocial factors, and retrospective changes in sleep pattern during the COVID-19 second wave lockdown period in Georgia. Data were collected through an online survey (n = 1117). The prevalence rate of probable insomnia disorder was 24.2%. Clinically relevant somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal was present in 49.8% and 58.0% of participants, and high levels of anxiety, depression and social isolation were found in 47.0%, 37.3%, 47.2% of respondents, respectively. We observed high prevalence rates of worse sleep quality, delayed bedtimes and risetimes, longer sleep latencies, higher awakenings and shorter sleep durations, relative to the pre-pandemic period. COVID-19-infected subjects showed more severe sleep and mental problems. Specific predictors differentially affected insomnia, somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. Depression and COVID-19 infection emerged as vulnerability factors for pre-sleep arousal, which, in turn, wasassociated with a higher predisposition to insomnia disorder. We confirm the strong deteriorating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and psychosocial well-being during the second wave lockdown period. The specific association between pre-sleep arousal, insomnia, and psychosocial factors is of clinical relevance for the prevention of severity and persistence of sleep and mental problems across the repeated lockdown/reopening waves. Modulation of pre-sleep arousal may prove beneficial to implement targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent in adults. TBI-related functional brain alterations have been linked with common post-TBI neurobehavioral sequelae, with unknown neural substrates. This study examined the systems-level functional brain alterations in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) for visual sustained-attention processing, and their interactions and contributions to post-TBI attention deficits. Task-based functional MRI data were collected from 42 adults with TBI and 43 group-matched normal controls (NCs), and analyzed using the graph theoretic technique. Global and nodal topological properties were calculated and compared between the two groups. Correlation analyses were conducted between the neuroimaging measures that showed significant between-group differences and the behavioral symptom measures in attention domain in the groups of TBI and NCs, respectively. Significantly altered nodal efficiencies and/or degrees in several WM and GM nodes were reported in the TBI group, including the posterior corona radiata (PCR), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), postcentral gyrus (PoG), and superior temporal sulcus (STS). Subjects with TBI also demonstrated abnormal systems-level functional synchronization between the PTR and STS in the right hemisphere, hypo-interaction between the PCR and PoG in the left hemisphere, as well as the involvement of systems-level functional aberrances in the PCR in TBI-related behavioral impairments in the attention domain. The findings of the current study suggest that TBI-related systems-level functional alterations associated with these two major-association WM tracts, and their anatomically connected GM regions may play critical role in TBI-related behavioral deficits in attention domains.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Time-varying pitch is a vital cue for human speech perception. Neural processing of time-varying pitch has been extensively assayed using scalp-recorded frequency-following responses (FFRs), an electrophysiological signal thought to reflect integrated phase-locked neural ensemble activity from subcortical auditory areas. Emerging evidence increasingly points to a putative contribution of auditory cortical ensembles to the scalp-recorded FFRs. However, the properties of cortical FFRs and precise characterization of laminar sources are still unclear. Here we used direct human intracortical recordings as well as extracranial and intracranial recordings from macaques and guinea pigs to characterize the properties of cortical sources of FFRs to time-varying pitch patterns. We found robust FFRs in the auditory cortex across all species. We leveraged representational similarity analysis as a translational bridge to characterize similarities between the human and animal models. Laminar recordings in animal models showed FFRs emerging primarily from the thalamorecipient layers of the auditory cortex. FFRs arising from these cortical sources significantly contributed to the scalp-recorded FFRs via volume conduction. Our research paves the way for a wide array of studies to investigate the role of cortical FFRs in auditory perception and plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Minimizing Iridium Oxide Electrodes for High Visual Acuity Subretinal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Vision loss from diseases of the outer retina, such as age-related macular degeneration, is among the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world today. The goal of retinal prosthetics is to replace the photo-sensing function of photoreceptors lost in these diseases with optoelectronic hardware to electrically stimulate patterns of retinal activity corresponding to vision. To enable high-resolution retinal prosthetics, the scale of stimulating electrodes must be significantly decreased from current designs; however, this reduces the amount of stimulating current that can be delivered. The efficacy of subretinal stimulation at electrode sizes suitable for high visual acuity retinal prosthesis are not well understood, particularly within the safe charge injection limits of electrode materials. Here, we measure retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses in a mouse model of blindness to evaluate the stimulation efficacy of 10, 20, and 30 &mu;m diameter iridium oxide electrodes within the electrode charge injection limits, focusing on measures of charge threshold and dynamic range. Stimulation thresholds were lower for smaller electrodes, but larger electrodes could elicit a greater dynamic range of spikes and recruited more ganglion cells within charge injection limits. These findings suggest a practical lower limit for planar electrode size and indicate strategies for maximizing stimulation thresholds and dynamic range.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here, we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>) which are age subspecialized on distinct defense tasks and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than nonsoldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and the smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Both high behavioral specialization in stable environmental conditions and reassignment across task groups during a crisis occur in <i>T. angustula</i>. The differences in neurobiology we report here are consistent with these specialized but flexible defense strategies. This work broadens our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.</p>

                Background: Natural products with antibacterial potential have begun to be tested on biofilm models, bringing us closer to understanding the response generated by the complex microbial ecosystems of the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities and chemical compositions of Peruvian propolis in an in vitro biofilm of Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Methods: The experimental work involved a consecutive, in vitro, longitudinal, and double-blinded study design. Propolis samples were collected from 13 different regions of the Peruvian Andes. The disk diffusion method was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test. The cytotoxic effect of propolis on human gingival fibroblasts was determined by cell viability method using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the effect of propolis on the biofilm was evaluated by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 0.78 mg/mL and 1.563 mg/mL concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the chloroform residue of Oxapampa propolis showed effects on biofilm thickness and the copy numbers of the srtA gene of S. gordonii and the radD gene of F. nucleatum at 48 and 120 hours, and chromatography (UV, λ 280 nm) identified rhamnocitrin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, kaempferol, diosmetin, acacetin, glycerol, and chrysoeriol. Conclusions: Of the 13 propolis evaluated, it was found that only the methanolic fraction of Oxapampa propolis showed antibacterial and antibiofilm effects without causing damage to human gingival fibroblasts. Likewise, when evaluating the chemical composition of this fraction, eight flavonoids were identified.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic on 11th March, 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the RCSB PDB database (PDB ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Out of 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as our top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. MD simulations disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but for experimental validation, they will require more in vivo trials.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatially distributed infection increases viral load in a computational model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie E. Moses, Steven Hofmeyr, Judy L. Cannon, Akil Andrews, Rebekah Gridley, Monica Hinga, Kirtus Leyba, Abigail Pribisova, Vanessa Surjadidjaja, Humayra Tasnim, Stephanie Forrest</p>

A key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes vary dramatically across individuals. Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells. SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads. The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence, oscillations, and control. By incorporating spatial interactions, SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response. When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented, we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells, but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed differential equation model. These results illustrate how realistic, spatially explicit computational models can improve understanding of within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A data-informed mean-field approach to mapping of cortical parameter landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhuo-Cheng Xiao, Kevin K. Lin, Lai-Sang Young</p>

Constraining the many biological parameters that govern cortical dynamics is computationally and conceptually difficult because of the curse of dimensionality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing (1) a novel data-informed mean-field (MF) approach to efficiently map the parameter space of network models; and (2) an organizing principle for studying parameter space that enables the extraction biologically meaningful relations from this high-dimensional data. We illustrate these ideas using a large-scale network model of the <i>Macaque</i> primary visual cortex. Of the 10-20 model parameters, we identify 7 that are especially poorly constrained, and use the MF algorithm in (1) to discover the firing rate contours in this 7D parameter cube. Defining a “biologically plausible” region to consist of parameters that exhibit spontaneous Excitatory and Inhibitory firing rates compatible with experimental values, we find that this region is a slightly thickened codimension-1 submanifold. An implication of this finding is that while plausible regimes depend sensitively on parameters, they are also robust and flexible provided one compensates appropriately when parameters are varied. Our organizing principle for conceptualizing parameter dependence is to focus on certain 2D parameter planes that govern lateral inhibition: Intersecting these planes with the biologically plausible region leads to very simple geometric structures which, when suitably scaled, have a universal character independent of where the intersections are taken. In addition to elucidating the geometry of the plausible region, this invariance suggests useful approximate scaling relations. Our study offers, for the first time, a complete characterization of the set of all biologically plausible parameters for a detailed cortical model, which has been out of reach due to the high dimensionality of parameter space.

                <p>by Deus Thindwa, Nicole Wolter, Amy Pinsent, Maimuna Carrim, John Ojal, Stefano Tempia, Jocelyn Moyes, Meredith McMorrow, Jackie Kleynhans, Anne von Gottberg, Neil French, PHIRST group , Cheryl Cohen, Stefan Flasche</p>

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults are at a higher risk of pneumococcal colonisation and disease, even while receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). To help evaluate potential indirect effects of vaccination of HIV-infected adults, we assessed whether HIV-infected adults disproportionately contribute to household transmission of pneumococci. We constructed a hidden Markov model to capture the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage acquisition and clearance observed during a longitudinal household-based nasopharyngeal swabbing study, while accounting for sample misclassifications. Households were followed-up twice weekly for approximately 10 months each year during a three-year study period for nasopharyngeal carriage detection via real-time PCR. We estimated the effect of participant’s age, HIV status, presence of a HIV-infected adult within the household and other covariates on pneumococcal acquisition and clearance probabilities. Of 1,684 individuals enrolled, 279 (16.6%) were younger children (<5 years-old) of whom 4 (1.5%) were HIV-infected and 726 (43.1%) were adults (≥18 years-old) of whom 214 (30.4%) were HIV-infected, most (173, 81.2%) with high CD4+ count. The observed range of pneumococcal carriage prevalence across visits was substantially higher in younger children (56.9–80.5%) than older children (5–17 years-old) (31.7–50.0%) or adults (11.5–23.5%). We estimate that 14.4% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 13.7–15.0) of pneumococcal-negative swabs were false negatives. Daily carriage acquisition probabilities among HIV-uninfected younger children were similar in households with and without HIV-infected adults (hazard ratio: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.91–1.01). Longer average carriage duration (11.4 days, 95%CI: 10.2–12.8 vs 6.0 days, 95%CI: 5.6–6.3) and higher median carriage density (622 genome equivalents per millilitre, 95%CI: 507–714 vs 389, 95%CI: 311.1–435.5) were estimated in HIV-infected vs HIV-uninfected adults. The use of ART and antibiotics substantially reduced carriage duration in all age groups, and acquisition rates increased with household size. Although South African HIV-infected adults on ART have longer carriage duration and density than their HIV-uninfected counterparts, they show similar patterns of pneumococcal acquisition and onward transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Numerical approaches for the rapid analysis of prophylactic efficacy against HIV with arbitrary drug-dosing schemes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lanxin Zhang, Junyu Wang, Max von Kleist</p>

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important pillar to prevent HIV transmission. Because of experimental and clinical shortcomings, mathematical models that integrate pharmacological, viral- and host factors are frequently used to quantify clinical efficacy of PrEP. Stochastic simulations of these models provides sample statistics from which the clinical efficacy is approximated. However, many stochastic simulations are needed to reduce the associated sampling error. To remedy the shortcomings of stochastic simulation, we developed a numerical method that allows predicting the efficacy of arbitrary prophylactic regimen directly from a viral dynamics model, without sampling. We apply the method to various hypothetical dolutegravir (DTG) prophylaxis scenarios. The approach is verified against state-of-the-art stochastic simulation. While the method is more accurate than stochastic simulation, it is superior in terms of computational performance. For example, a continuous 6-month prophylactic profile is computed within a few seconds on a laptop computer. The method’s computational performance, therefore, substantially expands the horizon of feasible analysis in the context of PrEP, and possibly other applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Meiotic Cas9 expression mediates gene conversion in the male and female mouse germline</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander J. Weitzel, Hannah A. Grunwald, Ceri Weber, Rimma Levina, Valentino M. Gantz, Stephen M. Hedrick, Ethan Bier, Kimberly L. Cooper</p>

Highly efficient gene conversion systems have the potential to facilitate the study of complex genetic traits using laboratory mice and, if implemented as a “gene drive,” to limit loss of biodiversity and disease transmission caused by wild rodent populations. We previously showed that such a system of gene conversion from heterozygous to homozygous after a sequence targeted CRISPR/Cas9 double-strand DNA break (DSB) is feasible in the female mouse germline. In the male germline, however, all DSBs were instead repaired by end joining (EJ) mechanisms to form an “insertion/deletion” (indel) mutation. These observations suggested that timing Cas9 expression to coincide with meiosis I is critical to favor conditions when homologous chromosomes are aligned and interchromosomal homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms predominate. Here, using a Cas9 knock-in allele at the <i>Spo11</i> locus, we show that meiotic expression of Cas9 does indeed mediate gene conversion in the male as well as in the female germline. However, the low frequency of both HDR and indel mutation in both male and female germlines suggests that Cas9 may be expressed from the <i>Spo11</i> locus at levels too low for efficient DSB formation. We suggest that more robust Cas9 expression initiated during early meiosis I may improve the efficiency of gene conversion and further increase the rate of “super-mendelian” inheritance from both male and female mice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Likely community transmission of COVID-19 infections between neighboring, persistent hotspots in Ontario, Canada [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources.  Results: This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">5G Millimeter-Wave Beamforming System using Substrate Integrated Waveguide [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Beamforming is a key element of 5G that uses advanced antenna technologies to focus a wireless signal to a defined direction. Butler Matrix (BM) as a beamforming network is used to control the beam direction by utilizing the amplitude and the output phase. A particular technique for designing BM is through substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), which is used to realize the bilateral edge wall vias where the waveguide mode propagates through to support the current flow and reduce the loss of surface wave. Unlike conventional BM, the proposed design requires only hybrid couplers and phase shifter without any crossover. In this BM structure, the SIW hybrid coupler is designed, with two phase shifters of -90°, and one phase shifter of -180° to control the amplitude and phase shifting. This results in an optimized transmission amplitude and output phase difference. The BM also circumvents any crossover, to provide minimal losses. The hybrid coupler exhibits Sii and Sij characteristics at 28 GHz, with values of -27.35 dB for return loss, -3.9 dB for insertion loss, -3.2 dB for coupling, and -26.54 dB for the isolation. In the BM design, high transmission efficiency is observed where the return loss is less than -10 dB, while minimal transmission amplitudes are obtained within the values of ‒6 ± 3 dB. The three-port BM is designed using SIW with minimal loss and the phase difference at each respective output port of the BM shows values of 0°, -120°, and 120°. The three consecutive beams with the gains of 11.1 dBi for port 1 excitation, 9.06 dBi for port 2 excitation and 10.4 dBi for port 3 excitation is achieved when the antenna array is fed to the BM, and each of the radiated beams has beam angles of 0, -27 and 27 degrees.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Extent, impact, and mitigation of batch effects in tumor biomarker studies using tissue microarrays</a></h4>

              
                Tissue microarrays (TMAs) have been used in thousands of cancer biomarker studies. To what extent batch effects, measurement error in biomarker levels between slides, affects TMA-based studies has not been assessed systematically. We evaluated 20 protein biomarkers on 14 TMAs with prospectively collected tumor tissue from 1,448 primary prostate cancers. In half of the biomarkers, more than 10% of biomarker variance was attributable to between-TMA differences (range, 1-48%). We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package <i>batchtma</i>), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects. Batch effects and resulting bias are not an error of an individual study but an inherent feature of TMA-based protein biomarker studies. They always need to be considered during study design and addressed analytically in studies using more than one TMA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Slowly evolving dopaminergic activity modulates the moment-to-moment probability of reward-related self-timed movements</a></h4>

              
                Clues from human movement disorders have long suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in motor control, but how the endogenous dopaminergic system influences movement is unknown. Here we examined the relationship between dopaminergic signaling and the timing of reward-related movements in mice. Animals were trained to initiate licking after a self-timed interval following a start-timing cue; reward was delivered in response to movements initiated after a criterion time. The movement time was variable from trial-to-trial, as expected from previous studies. Surprisingly, dopaminergic signals ramped-up over seconds between the start-timing cue and the self-timed movement, with variable dynamics that predicted the movement/reward time on single trials. Steeply rising signals preceded early lick-initiation, whereas slowly rising signals preceded later initiation. Higher baseline signals also predicted earlier self-timed movements. Optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons during self-timing did not trigger immediate movements, but rather caused systematic early-shifting of movement initiation, whereas inhibition caused late-shifting, as if modulating the probability of movement. Consistent with this view, the dynamics of the endogenous dopaminergic signals quantitatively predicted the moment-by-moment probability of movement initiation on single trials. We propose that ramping dopaminergic signals, likely encoding dynamic reward expectation, can modulate the decision of when to move.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cnidarian hair cell development illuminates an ancient role for the class IV POU transcription factor in defining mechanoreceptor identity</a></h4>

              
                Although specialized mechanosensory cells are found across animal phylogeny, early evolutionary histories of mechanoreceptor development remain enigmatic. Cnidaria (e.g. sea anemones and jellyfishes) is the sister group to well-studied Bilateria (e.g. flies and vertebrates), and has two mechanosensory cell types - a lineage-specific sensory-effector known as the cnidocyte, and a classical mechanosensory neuron referred to as the hair cell. While developmental genetics of cnidocytes is increasingly understood, genes essential for cnidarian hair cell development are unknown. Here we show that the class IV POU homeodomain transcription factor (POU-IV) - an indispensable regulator of mechanosensory cell differentiation in Bilateria and cnidocyte differentiation in Cnidaria - controls hair cell development in the sea anemone cnidarian <i>Nematostella vectensis. N. vectensis </i>POU-IV is postmitotically expressed in tentacular hair cells, and is necessary for development of the apical mechanosensory apparatus, but not of neurites, in hair cells. Moreover, it binds to deeply conserved DNA recognition elements, and turns on a unique set of effector genes - including the transmembrane-receptor-encoding gene <i>polycystin 1 </i>- specifically in hair cells. Our results suggest that POU-IV directs differentiation of cnidarian hair cells and cnidocytes via distinct gene regulatory mechanisms, and support an evolutionarily ancient role for POU-IV in defining the mature state of mechanosensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of distinct fibroblast lineages and immune cells in dermal repair following UV radiation induced tissue damage</a></h4>

              
                Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a major source of skin damage, resulting in inflammation, premature ageing and cancer. While several UVR-induced changes, including extracellular matrix reorganisation and epidermal DNA damage, have been documented, the role of different fibroblast lineages and their communication with immune cells has not been explored. We show that acute and chronic UVR exposure led to selective loss of fibroblasts from the upper dermis in human and mouse skin. Lineage tracing and in vivo live imaging revealed that repair following acute UVR is predominantly mediated by papillary fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast reorganisation occurs with minimal migration. In contrast, chronic UVR exposure led to a permanent loss of papillary fibroblasts, with expansion of fibroblast membrane protrusions partially compensating for the reduction in cell number. Although UVR strongly activated Wnt-signalling in skin, stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by epidermal b-catenin stabilisation did not enhance papillary dermis repair. Acute UVR triggered an infiltrate of neutrophils and T cell subpopulations and increased pro-inflammatory prostaglandin signalling in skin. Depletion of CD4 and CD8 positive cells resulted in increased papillary fibroblast depletion, which correlated with an increase in DNA damage, pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and reduction in fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, topical COX-2 inhibition prevented fibroblast depletion and neutrophil infiltration after UVR. We conclude that loss of papillary fibroblasts is primarily induced by a deregulated inflammatory response, with infiltrating T cells supporting fibroblast survival upon UVR-induced environmental stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Addition of a carboxy terminal tail to the normally tailless gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor impairs fertility in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary neuropeptide controlling reproduction in vertebrates. GnRH stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis via a G protein-coupled receptor, GnRHR, in the pituitary gland. In mammals, GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Ctail) and does not exhibit homologous desensitization. This might be an evolutionary adaptation that enables LH surge generation and ovulation. To test this idea, we fused the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous murine GnRHR in a transgenic model. The LH surge was blunted, but not blocked in these mice. In contrast, they showed reductions in FSH production, ovarian follicle development, and fertility. Addition of the Ctail altered the nature of agonist-induced calcium signaling required for normal FSH production. The loss of the GnRHR Ctail during mammalian evolution is unlikely to have conferred a selective advantage by enabling the LH surge. The adaptive significance of this specialization remains to be determined.

                Myocardial infarction (MI) is accompanied by severe energy deprivation and extensive epigenetic changes. However, how energy metabolism and chromatin modifications are interlinked during MI and heart repair has been poorly explored. Here, we examined the effect of different carbon sources that are involved in the major metabolic pathways of acetyl-CoA synthesis on myocardial infarction and found that elevation of acetyl-CoA by sodium octanoate (8C) significantly improved heart function in ischemia reperfusion (I/R) rats. Mechanistically, 8C reduced I/R injury by promoting histone acetylation which in turn activated the expression of antioxidant genes and inhibited cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Furthermore, we elucidated that 8C-promoted histone acetylation and heart repair were carried out by metabolic enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and histone acetyltransferase Kat2a, suggesting that 8C dramatically improves cardiac function mainly through metabolic acetyl-CoA-mediated histone acetylation. Therefore, our study uncovers an interlinked metabolic/epigenetic network comprising 8C, acetyl-CoA, MCAD, and Kat2a to combat heart injury.

                As we interact with the external world, we judge magnitudes from sensory information. The estimation of magnitudes has been characterized in primates, yet it is largely unexplored in non-primate species. Here we use time interval reproduction to study rodent behavior and its neural correlates in the context of magnitude estimation. We show that gerbils display primate-like magnitude estimation characteristics in time reproduction. Most prominently their behavioral responses show a systematic overestimation of small stimuli and an underestimation of large stimuli, often referred to as regression effect. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms by recording from medial prefrontal cortex and show that the majority of neurons respond either during the measurement or the reproduction of a time interval. Cells that are active during both phases display distinct response patterns. We categorize the neural responses into multiple types and demonstrate that only populations with mixed responses can encode the bias of the regression effect. These results help unveil the organizing neural principles of time reproduction and perhaps magnitude estimation in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosstalk with keratinocytes causes GNAQ oncogene specificity in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                Different melanoma subtypes exhibit specific and non-overlapping sets of oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations, despite a common cell of origin in melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gα<sub>q/11 </sub>signaling pathway is a characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, uveal tract or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the epidermis. The mechanism for this specificity is unknown. Here, we present evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene. We found that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>, in combination with signaling from the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), stimulates dendrite extension, leads to actin cytoskeleton disorganization, inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in melanocytes. The effect was reversible and paracrine. In contrast,  the epidermal environment increased the survival of wildtype and Braf<sup>V600E</sup> expressing melanocytes. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of Ga<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, the identification of the epidermal signals that restrain the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene could suggest novel therapies for <i>GNAQ</i> and <i>GNA11</i> mutant melanomas.

                HAP2 is a transmembrane gamete fusogen found in multiple eukaryotic kingdoms and is structurally homologous to viral class II fusogens. Studies in <i>Plasmodium</i> have suggested that HAP2 is an attractive target for vaccines that block transmission of malaria. HAP2 has three extracellular domains, arranged in the order D2, D1, and D3. Here, we report monoclonal antibodies against the D3 fragment of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> HAP2 and crystal structures of D3 in complex with Fab fragments of two of these antibodies, one of which blocks fertilization of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> in vitro and transmission of malaria in mosquitoes. We also show how this Fab binds the complete HAP2 ectodomain with electron microscopy. The two antibodies cross-react with HAP2 among multiple plasmodial species. Our characterization of the <i>Plasmodium</i> D3 structure, HAP2 ectodomain architecture, and mechanism of inhibition provide insights for the development of a vaccine to block malaria transmission.

                The Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) cycle is arguably the most critical metabolic cycle in physiology and exists as an essential interface coordinating cellular metabolism, bioenergetics, and redox homeostasis. Despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the consequences of TCA cycle dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we targeted two TCA cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and combined metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses to fully appraise the consequences of TCA cycle inhibition (TCAi) in murine kidney epithelial cells. Our comparative approach shows that TCAi elicits a convergent rewiring of redox and amino acid metabolism dependent on the activation of ATF4 and the integrated stress response (ISR). Furthermore, we also uncover a divergent metabolic response, whereby acute FHi, but not SDHi, can maintain asparagine levels via reductive carboxylation and maintenance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis. Our work highlights an important interplay between the TCA cycle, redox biology and amino acid homeostasis.

                Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must ensure adequate blood cell production following distinct external stressors. A comprehensive understanding of in vivo heterogeneity and specificity of HSC responses to external stimuli is currently lacking. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on functionally validated mouse HSCs and LSK (Lin-, c-Kit+, Sca1+) progenitors after in vivo pharmacological perturbation of niche signals interferon, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and prostaglandin. We identified six HSC states that are characterized by enrichment but not exclusive expression of marker genes. External signals induced rapid transitions between HSC states but transcriptional response varied both between external stimulants and within the HSC population for a given perturbation. In contrast to LSK progenitors, HSCs were characterized by a greater link between molecular signatures at baseline and in response to external stressors. Chromatin analysis of unperturbed HSCs and LSKs by scATAC-Seq suggested some HSC-specific, cell intrinsic predispositions to niche signals. We compiled a comprehensive resource of HSC- and LSK progenitor-specific chromatin and transcriptional features that represent determinants of signal receptiveness and regenerative potential during stress hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammasome activation leads to cDC1-independent cross-priming of CD8 T cells by epithelial cell derived antigen</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune system detects pathogens and initiates adaptive immune responses. Inflammasomes are central components of the innate immune system, but whether inflammasomes provide sufficient signals to activate adaptive immunity is unclear. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), inflammasomes activate a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis, leading to epithelial cell expulsion and the release of cytokines. Here we employed a genetic system to show that simultaneous antigen expression and inflammasome activation specifically in IECs is sufficient to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. By genetic elimination of direct T cell priming by IECs, we found that IEC-derived antigens are cross-presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, cross-presentation of IEC-derived antigen to CD8+ T cells only partially depended on IEC pyroptosis. In the absence of inflammasome activation, cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required <i>Batf3</i><sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (cDC1), whereas cross-priming in the presence of pyroptosis required a <i>Zbtb26</i><sup>+</sup> but <i>Batf3</i>-independent cDC population. These data suggest the existence of parallel pyroptosis-dependent and pyroptosis-independent pathways for cross-presentation of IEC-derived antigens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">FMRP regulates mRNAs encoding distinct functions in the cell body and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on translation of synaptic mRNAs in order to generate activity-dependent changes in plasticity. Here we develop a strategy combining compartment-specific CLIP and TRAP in conditionally tagged mice to precisely define the ribosome-bound dendritic transcriptome of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We identify CA1 dendritic transcripts with differentially localized mRNA isoforms generated by alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing, including many which have altered protein-coding capacity. Among dendritic mRNAs, FMRP targets were found to be overrepresented. Cell-type specific FMRP-CLIP and TRAP in microdissected CA1 neuropil revealed 383 dendritic FMRP targets and suggests that FMRP differentially regulates functionally distinct modules in CA1 dendrites and cell bodies. FMRP regulates ~15-20% of mRNAs encoding synaptic functions and 10% of chromatin modulators, in the dendrite and cell body, respectively. In the absence of FMRP, dendritic FMRP targets had increased ribosome association, consistent with a function for FMRP in synaptic translational repression. Conversely, downregulation of FMRP targets involved in chromatin regulation in cell bodies and suggest a role for FMRP in stabilizing mRNAs containing stalled ribosomes in this compartment. Together, the data support a model in which FMRP regulates the translation and expression of synaptic and nuclear proteins within different compartments of a single neuronal cell type.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurons burdened by DNA double strand breaks incite microglia activation through antiviral-like signaling in neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are linked to aging, neurodegeneration, and senescence. However, the role played by neurons burdened with DSBs in disease-associated neuroinflammation is not well understood. Here, we isolate neurons harboring DSBs from the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration through fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS), and characterize their transcriptomes using single-nucleus, bulk, and spatial sequencing techniques. We find that neurons harboring DSBs enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by the activation of senescent and antiviral-like immune pathways. We identify the NFkB transcription factor as a master regulator of immune gene expression in DSB-bearing neurons, and find that the expression of cytokines like Cxcl10 and Ccl2 develop in DSB-bearing neurons before glial cell types. Alzheimers Disease pathology is significantly associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons, and direct purification of DSB-bearing neurons from Alzheimers Disease brain tissue further validates immune gene upregulation. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons also harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFkB knock down in neurons. Inhibition of NFkB or depletion of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglial activation in organotypic brain slice culture. In conclusion, we find that in the context of age-associated neurodegenerative disease, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation. These findings highlight a novel role for neurons in the mechanism of age-associated neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying the inverted U: A meta-analysis of prefrontal dopamine, D1-receptors, and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex can be disrupted in human disorders that affect cognitive function such as Parkinson's disease (PD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Dopamine has a powerful effect on prefrontal circuits via the D1-type dopamine receptor (D1DR). It has been proposed that prefrontal dopamine has "inverted U-shaped" dynamics, with optimal dopamine and D1DR signaling required for optimal cognitive function. However, the quantitative relationship between prefrontal dopamine and cognitive function is not clear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of published manipulations of prefrontal dopamine and the effects on working memory, a high-level executive function in humans, primates, and rodents that involves maintaining and manipulating information over seconds to minutes. We reviewed 646 papers and found that 75 studies met criteria for inclusion. Our quantification of effect sizes for dopamine, D1DRs, and behavior revealed a negative quadratic slope. This is consistent with the proposed inverted U-shape of prefrontal dopamine and D1DRs and working memory performance, explaining 10% of the variance. Of note, the inverted quadratic fit was much stronger for prefrontal D1DRs alone, explaining 26% of the variance, compared to prefrontal dopamine alone, explaining 10% of the variance. Taken together, these data, derived from a variety of manipulations and systems, demonstrate that optimal prefrontal dopamine signalling is linked with higher cognitive function. Our results provide insight into the fundamental dynamics of prefrontal dopamine, which could be useful for pharmacological interventions targeting prefrontal dopaminergic circuits, and into the pathophysiology of human brain disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo, neuron-specific approach for pairing translational and epigenetic signatures of early-life exercise</a></h4>

              
                Aerobic exercise promotes physiological and molecular adaptations in neurons to influence brain function and behavior. The most well studied neurobiological consequences of exercise are those which underlie exercise-induced improvements in hippocampal memory, including the expression and regulation of the neurotrophic factor Bdnf. Whether aerobic exercise taking place during early-life periods of postnatal brain maturation has similar impacts on gene expression and its regulation remains to be investigated. Using unbiased next-generation sequencing we characterize gene expression programs and their regulation by specific, memory-associated histone modifications during juvenile-adolescent voluntary exercise (ELE). Traditional transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing approaches have either used heterogeneous cell populations from whole tissue homogenates or flow cytometry for single cell isolation to distinguish cell types / subtypes. These methods fall short in providing cell-type specificity without compromising sequencing depth or procedure-induced changes to cellular phenotype. In this study, we use simultaneous isolation of translating mRNA and nuclear chromatin from a neuron-enriched cell population to more accurately pair ELE-induced changes in gene expression with epigenetic modifications. We employ a line of transgenic mice expressing the NuTRAP (Nuclear Tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) cassette under the Emx1 promoter allowing for brain cell-type specificity. We then developed a technique that combines nuclear isolation using Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in Specific Cell Types (INTACT) with Translating Ribosomal Affinity Purification (TRAP) methods to determine cell type-specific epigenetic modifications influencing gene expression programs from a population of Emx1 expressing hippocampal neurons. Data from RNA-seq and CUT&RUN-seq were coupled to evaluate histone modifications influencing the expression of translating mRNA in neurons after early-life exercise (ELE). We also performed separate INTACT and TRAP isolations for validation of our protocol and demonstrate similar molecular functions and biological processes implicated by gene ontology (GO) analysis. Finally, as prior studies use tissue from opposite brain hemispheres to pair transcriptomic and epigenomic data from the same rodent, we take a bioinformatics approach to compare hemispheric differences in gene expression programs and histone modifications altered by by ELE. Our data reveal transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of ELE exposure and identify novel candidate gene-histone modification interactions for further investigation. Importantly, our novel approach of combined INTACT/TRAP methods from the same cell suspension allows for simultaneous transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing in a cell-type specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Frequency transfer of the ventriloquism aftereffect</a></h4>

              
                The ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) describes the persistent shift of perceived sound location after having been adapted to a ventriloquism condition, in which the sound was repeatedly paired with a displaced visual stimulus. In the latter case, participants consistently mislocalize the sound in the direction of the visual stimulus (ventriloquism effect, VE). Previous studies provide conflicting reports regarding the strength of the VAE, ranging from 0 to nearly 100%. Moreover, there is controversy about its generalization to different sounds than the one inducing the VE, ranging from no transfer at all, to full transfer across different sound spectra. Here, we imposed the VE for three different sounds: a low-frequency and a high-frequency narrow-band noise, and a broadband Gaussian white noise (GWN). In the adaptation phase, listeners generated fast goal-directed head movements to localize the sound, presented across a 70 deg range in the horizontal plane, while ignoring a visual distracter that was consistently displaced 10 deg to the right of the sound. In the post-adaptation phase, participants localized narrow-band sounds with center frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz, as well as GWN, without the visual distracter. Our results show that the VAE amounted to approximately 40% of the VE and generalized well across the entire frequency domain. We also found that the strength of the VAE correlated with the pre-adaptation sound-localization performance. We compare our results with previous reports and discuss different hypotheses regarding optimal audio-visual cue integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning enhances encoding of time and temporal surprise in primary sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortex has long been believed to play a straightforward role in the initial processing of sensory information. Yet, the superficial layers of cortex overall are sparsely active, even during sensory stimulation; moreover, cortical activity is influenced by other modalities, task context, reward, and behavioral state. Our study demonstrates that reinforcement learning dramatically alters representations among longitudinally imaged neurons in superficial layers of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Learning an object detection task recruits previously unresponsive neurons, enlarging the neuronal population sensitive to touch and behavioral choice. In contrast, cortical responses decrease upon repeated exposure to unrewarded stimuli. Moreover, training improved population encoding of the passage of time, and unexpected deviations in trial timing elicited even stronger responses than touch did. In conclusion, the superficial layers of sensory cortex exhibit a high degree of learning-dependent plasticity and are strongly modulated by non-sensory but behaviorally-relevant features, such as timing and surprise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hippocampal network states support theta phase precession and theta sequences in CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus likely uses temporal coding to represent complex memories via mechanisms such as theta phase precession and theta sequences. Theta sequences are rapid sweeps of spikes from multiple place cells, encoding past or planned trajectories or non-spatial information. Phase precession, the correlation between a place cell's theta firing phase and animal position has been suggested to facilitate sequence emergence. We find that CA1 phase precession varies strongly across cells and environmental contingencies. Phase precession depends on the CA1 network state, and is only present when the medium gamma oscillation (60-90 Hz, linked to Entorhinal inputs) dominates. Conversely, theta sequences are most evident for non-precessing cells or with leading slow gamma (20-45 Hz, linked to CA3 inputs). These results challenge the view that phase precession is the mechanism underlying the emergence of theta sequences and point at a 'dual network states' model for hippocampal temporal code, potentially supporting merging of memory and exogenous information in CA1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subject-specific features of excitation/inhibition profiles in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Brain pathologies are based on microscopic changes in neurons and synapses that reverberate into large scale networks altering brain dynamics and functional states. An important yet unresolved issue concerns the impact of patients excitation/inhibition profiles on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In this work we used a simulation platform, The Virtual Brain, to simulate brain dynamics in healthy controls and in Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. The brain connectome and functional connectivity were extracted from 3T-MRI scans and The Virtual Brain nodes were represented by a Wong-Wang neural mass model endowing an explicit representation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. The integration of cerebro-cerebellar loops improved the correlation between experimental and simulated functional connectivity, and hence The Virtual Brain predictive power, in all pathological conditions. The Virtual Brain biophysical parameters differed between clinical phenotypes, predicting higher global coupling and inhibition in Alzheimer's disease and stronger NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent excitation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. These physio-pathological parameters allowed an advanced analysis of patients' state. In backward regressions, The Virtual Brain parameters significantly contributed to explain the variation of neuropsychological scores and, in discriminant analysis, the combination of The Virtual Brain parameters and neuropsychological scores significantly improved discriminative power between clinical conditions. Eventually, cluster analysis provided a unique description of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in individual patients. In aggregate, The Virtual Brain simulations reveal differences in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of individual patients that, combined with cognitive assessment, can promote the personalized diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crosstalk between biochemical signaling and trafficking determines AMPAR dynamics in synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity involves the modification of both biochemical and structural components of neurons. Many studies have revealed that the change in the number density of the glutamatergic receptor AMPAR at the synapse is proportional to synaptic weight update; increase in AMPAR corresponds to strengthening of synapses while decrease in AMPAR density weakens synaptic connections. The dynamics of AMPAR are thought to be regulated by upstream signaling, primarily the calcium-CaMKII pathway, trafficking to and from the synapse, and influx from extrasynaptic sources. Here, we have developed a set of models using compartmental ordinary differential equations to systematically investigate contributions of signaling and trafficking variations on AMPAR dynamics at the synaptic site. We find that the model properties including network architecture and parameters significantly affect the integration of fast upstream species by slower downstream species. Furthermore, we predict that the model outcome, as determined by bound AMPAR at the synaptic site, depends on (a) the choice of signaling model (bistable CaMKII or monostable CaMKII dynamics), (b) trafficking versus influx contributions, and (c) frequency of stimulus. Therefore, AMPAR dynamics can have unexpected dependencies when upstream signaling dynamics (such as CaMKII and PP1) are coupled with trafficking modalities.

                During action selection, mammals exhibit a high degree of flexibility in adapting their decisions in response to environmental changes. Although the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) network is implicated in this adaptation, it features a synaptic architecture comprising multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, complicating efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process of evidence accumulation during decision-making. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to parameters of a normative drift diffusion model (DDM) representing algorithmic aspects of information accumulation during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles impacting specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide key mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in shifting different aspects of decision policies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spherical harmonic based noise rejection and neuronal sampling with multi-axis OPMs</a></h4>

              
                In this study we explore the interference rejection and spatial sampling properties of multi-axis Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) data. We use both vector spherical harmonics and eigenspectra to quantify how well an array can separate neuronal signal from environmental interference while adequately sampling the entire cortex. We found that triaxial OPMs have superb noise rejection properties allowing for very high orders of interference (L=6) to be accounted for while minimally affecting the neural space (2dB attenuation for a 60-sensor triaxial system). To adequately model the signals arising from the cortex, we show that at least 11th order (143 spatial degrees of freedom) irregular solid harmonics or 95 eigenvectors of the lead field are needed to model the neural space for OPM data (regardless of number of axes measured). This can be adequately sampled with 75-100 equidistant triaxial sensors (225-300 channels) or 200 equidistant radial channels. In other words, ordering the same number of channels in triaxial (rather than purely radial) configuration gives significant advantages not only in terms of external noise rejection but also minimizes cost, weight and cross-talk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Theta oscillations in the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit do not couple to respiration-related oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory activity is thought to coordinate neural computations across brain regions, and theta oscillations are critical for learning and memory. Because the frequency of respiratory-related oscillations (RROs) in rodents can overlap with the frequency of theta in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus, we asked whether odor-cued working memory may be supported by coupling between these two oscillations. We first confirmed that RROs are propagated to the hippocampus and PFC and that RRO frequency overlaps with canonical theta frequency. However, we found low coherence between RROs and local theta oscillations in the hippocampus-PFC network when the two types of oscillations overlapped in frequency. This effect was observed during all behavioral phases including during movement and while odors were actively sampled when stationary. Despite the similarity in frequency, RROs and theta oscillations therefore appear to be limited to supporting computation in distinct networks, which suggests that sustained long-range coordination between oscillation patterns that depend on separate pacemakers is not necessary to support at least one type of working memory.

                The present study proposes a novel concept of neuroadaptive technology, namely a dual passive-reactive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), that enables bi-directional interaction between humans and machines. We have implemented such a system in a realistic flight simulator using the NextMind classification algorithms and framework to decode pilots' intention (reactive BCI) and to infer their level of attention (passive BCI). Twelve pilots used the reactive BCI to perform checklists along with an anti-collision radar monitoring task that was supervised by the passive BCI. The latter simulated an automatic avoidance maneuver when it detected that pilots missed an incoming collision. The reactive BCI reached 100% classification accuracy with a mean reaction time of 1.6s when exclusively performing the checklist task. Accuracy was up to 98.5% with a mean reaction time of 2.5s when pilots also had to fly the aircraft and monitor the anti-collision radar. The passive BCI achieved a F1 score of 0.94. This first demonstration shows the potential of a dual BCI to improve human-machine teaming which could be applied to a variety of applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-error slowing reflects the joint impact of adaptive and maladaptive processes during decision making</a></h4>

              
                Errors and their consequences are typically studied by investigating changes in decision speed and accuracy in trials that follow an error, commonly referred to as "post-error adjustments". Many studies have reported that subjects slow down following an error, a phenomenon called "post-error slowing" (PES). However, the functional significance of PES is still a matter of debate as it is not always adaptive. That is, it is not always associated with a gain in performance and can even occur with a decline in accuracy. Here, we hypothesized that the nature of PES is influenced by one's speed-accuracy tradeoff policy, which determines the overall level of choice accuracy in the task at hand. To test this hypothesis, we investigated post-error adjustments in subjects performing the same task while they were required to either emphasize speed (low accuracy) or cautiousness (high accuracy) in two distinct contexts (hasty and cautious contexts, respectively) experienced on separate days. Accordingly, our data indicate that post-error adjustments varied according to the context in which subjects performed the task, with PES being solely significant in the hasty context. In addition, we only observed a gain in performance after errors in a specific trial type, suggesting that post-error adjustments depend on a complex combination of processes that affect the speed of ensuing actions as well as the degree to which such PES comes with a gain in performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal lesion network mapping to predict sensorimotor behavior in stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                Lesion network mapping (LNM) has proved to be a successful technique to map symptoms to brain networks after acquired brain injury. Beyond the characteristics of a lesion, such as its etiology, size or location, LNM has shown that common symptoms in patients after injury may reflect the effects of their lesions on the same circuits, thereby linking symptoms to specific brain networks. Here, we extend LNM to its multimodal form, using a combination of functional and structural connectivity maps drawn from data from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We applied the multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Test scores were predicted using a Canonical Correlation Analysis with multimodal brain maps as independent variables, and cross-validation strategies were employed to overcome overfitting. The results obtained led us to draw three conclusions. First, the multimodal analysis reveals how functional connectivity maps contribute more than structural connectivity maps in the optimal prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, the maximal association solution between the behavioral outcome and multimodal lesion connectivity maps suggests an equal contribution of sensory and motor coefficients, in contrast to the unimodal analyses where the sensory contribution dominates in both structural and functional maps. Finally, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural connectivity maps strongly depends on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect of larger lesions that produce more severe sensorimotor dysfunction. By contrast, the maps of functional connectivity performed similarly irrespective of any correction for lesion size. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of imaging modalities, and the influence of their corresponding brain networks on behavioral performance after acquired brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Remote contextual fear retrieval engages activity from salience network regions in rats</a></h4>

              
                The ability to retrieve contextual fear memories depends on the coordinated activation of a brain-wide circuitry. Transition from recent to remote memories seems to involve the reorganization of this circuitry, a process called systems consolidation that has been associated with time-dependent fear generalization. However, it is not known whether emotional memories acquired under different levels of stress can undergo different systems consolidation processes. Here, we explored the activation pattern and functional connectivity of key brain regions associated with contextual fear conditioning (CFC) retrieval after recent (2 days) or remote (28 days) memory tests performed in rats submitted to strong (1.0mA footshock) or mild (0.3mA footshock) training. We used brain tissue from Wistar rats from a previous study, where we observed that increasing training intensity promotes fear memory generalization over time, possibly due to an increase in corticosterone levels during memory consolidation. Analysis of Fos expression across 8 regions of interest (ROIs) allowed us to identify coactivation between them at both timepoints following memory recall. Our results showed that strong CFC elicits higher Fos activation in the anterior insular and prelimbic cortices during remote retrieval, which was - along with the basolateral amygdala - positively correlated with freezing. Rats trained either with mild or strong CFC showed a broad functional connectivity at the recent timepoint whereas only animals submitted to the strong CFC showed a widespread loss of coactivation during remote retrieval. Our findings suggest that increasing training intensity results in differential processes of systems consolidation, possibly associated with increased post-training corticosterone release, and that strong CFC engages activity from areas associated with the salience network during remote retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correlation of receptor density and mRNA expression patterns in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Changes in distribution of associated molecular targets have been reported across several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the high-resolution topology of most proteins is unknown and simultaneous in vivo measurement in multi-receptor systems is complicated. To account for the missing proteomic information, mRNA transcripts are typically used as a surrogate. Nonetheless, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes might cause the discrepancy between the final distribution of proteins and gene expression patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate ex vivo links between mRNA expression and corresponding receptor density in the human cerebral cortex. To this end, autoradiography data on the density of 15 different receptors in 38 brain regions were correlated with the expression patterns of 50 associated genes derived from microarray data (mA), RNA sequencing data (RNA-Seq) provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas and predicted mRNA expression patterns (pred-mRNA). Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the possible links between proteomic data and mRNA expression patterns. Correlations between mRNA and protein density varied greatly between targets: Positive associations were found for e.g. the serotonin 1A (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.708; mA: rs = 0.601) or kainate receptor (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.655; mA: rs = 0.601; RNA-Seq: rs = 0.575), while most of the investigated target receptors showed low or negative correlations. The high variability in the correspondence of mRNA expression and receptor warrants caution when inferring the topology of molecular targets in the brain from transcriptome data. This highlights the longstanding value of molecular imaging data and the need for comprehensive proteomic data.

                Acute stress triggers plasticity of forebrain synapses as well as behavioral changes. Here we reveal that Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF) is a required downstream mediator of the stress response in mice, necessary for stress-induced synaptic potentiation in the ventral hippocampus and for an increase in anxiety-like behaviour. Acute stress is sufficient to activate microglia, triggering the long-term release TNF. Critically, on-going TNF signaling in the ventral hippocampus is necessary to sustain both the stress-induced synaptic and behavioral changes, as these could be reversed hours after induction by antagonizing TNF signaling. This demonstrates that TNF maintains the synaptic and behavioral stress response in vivo, making TNF a potential novel therapeutic target for stress disorders.

                Microglia are critical for brain development and play a central role in Alzheimers disease (AD) etiology. Down syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21, is the most common genetic origin of intellectual disability and the most common risk factor for AD. Surprisingly, little information is available on the impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglia in DS brain development and AD in DS (DSAD). Using our new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based human microglia-containing cerebral organoid and chimeric mouse brain models, here we report that DS microglia exhibit enhanced synaptic pruning function during brain development. Consequently, electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that DS microglial mouse chimeras show impaired synaptic neurotransmission, as compared to control microglial chimeras. Upon being exposed to human brain tissue-derived soluble pathological tau, DS microglia display dystrophic phenotypes in chimeric mouse brains, recapitulating microglial responses seen in human AD and DSAD brain tissues. Further flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and immunohistological analyses of chimeric mouse brains demonstrate that DS microglia undergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type I interferon signaling after being challenged by pathological tau. Mechanistically, we find that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsa21encoded type I interferon receptor genes, IFNARs, rescues the defective DS microglial phenotypes both during brain development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide first in vivo evidence supporting a paradigm shifting theory that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting accelerated senescence and dystrophic phenotypes. Our results further suggest that targeting IFNARs may improve microglial functions during DS brain development and prevent human microglial senescence in DS individuals with AD.

                Synucleinopathies including Parkinsons disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intracellular accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein called Lewy pathology. Alpha-synuclein within Lewy pathology is aggregated into protease resistant filamentous structures and is predominantly phosphorylated at serine 129 (PSER129). Lewy pathology has been hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system as the disease progresses. Cross-sectional studies have shown the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract consistently bare LP for common synucleinopathies, making these structures likely starting points for the spreading process, and thus disease. Here we examined the distribution of PSER129 in non-diseased brain. To do this we used a sensitive tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique to detect low abundance endogenous PSER129 under ideal antibody binding conditions. In wild-type non-diseased mice, PSER129 was detected in the olfactory bulb and several brain regions of the olfactory cortex across the neuroaxis (i.e., olfactory bulb to brain stem). PSER129 was particularly apparent in the mitral cell layer and the outer plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb where it was observed as cytosolic/nuclear puncta or fibers, respectively. PSER129 immunoreactivity in the healthy olfactory bulb was abolished by pretreatment of the tissue with proteinase K, pre-absorption of the primary antibody against the purified PSER129 peptide fragment, or the omission of the PSER129 antibody. Furthermore, PSER129 immunoreactivity was not observed in any brain region of alpha-synuclein knockout mice. Dual labeling for the PSER129 and the mitral cell marker TBX21 showed that PSER129 positive structures of the healthy OB were found in mitral cells. We found evidence of the same PSER129 positive structures in the olfactory bulb of non-diseased rats, non-human primates, healthy humans, but not individuals diagnosed with PD. Results suggest biological pathways responsible for alpha-synuclein phosphorylation are constitutively active in OB mitral cells and alpha-synuclein in these cells may be predisposed to pathological aggregation. Pathological seeds originating in mitral cells may act as a source for alpha-synuclein spread competent assemblies that spreads throughout the brain via fibers of the olfactory tract. Future studies should investigate the normal function of alpha-synuclein in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, which may give insight into synucleinopathy disease origins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ensemble of toxic channel types underlies the severity of the de novo variant G375R of the human BK channel</a></h4>

              
                De novo mutations play a prominent role in neurodevelopmental diseases including autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Many de novo mutations are dominant and so severe that the afflicted individuals do not reproduce, so the mutations are not passed into the general population. For multimeric proteins, such severity may result from a dominant-negative effect where mutant subunits assemble with WT to produce channels with adverse properties. Here we study the de novo variant G375R heterozygous with the WT allele for the large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated potassium (BK) channel, Slo1. This variant has been reported to produce devastating neurodevelopmental disorders in three unrelated children. If mutant and WT subunits assemble randomly to form tetrameric BK channels, then ~6% of the assembled channels would be wild type (WT), ~88% would be heteromeric incorporating from 1-3 mutant subunits per channel, and ~6% would be homomeric mutant channels consisting of four mutant subunits. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the biophysical properties of single BK channels in the ensemble of channels expressed following a 1:1 injection of mutant and WT cRNA into oocytes. We found ~3% were WT channels, ~85% were heteromeric channels, and ~12% were homomeric mutant channels. All of the heteromeric channels as well as the homomeric mutant channels displayed toxic properties, indicating a dominant negative effect of the mutant subunits. The toxic channels were open at inappropriate negative voltages, even in the absence of Ca2+, which would lead to altered cellular function and decreased neuronal excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible and efficient simulation-based inference for models of decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Identifying parameters of computational models that capture experimental data is a central task in cognitive neuroscience. Bayesian statistical inference aims to not only find a single configuration of best-fitting parameters, but to recover all model parameters that are consistent with the data and prior knowledge. Statistical inference methods usually require the ability to evaluate the likelihood of the model--however, for many models of interest in cognitive neuroscience, the associated likelihoods cannot be computed efficiently. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a solution to this problem by only requiring access to simulations produced by the model. Here, we provide an efficient SBI method for models of decision-making. Our approach, Mixed Neural Likelihood Estimation (MNLE), trains neural density estimators on model simulations to emulate the simulator. The likelihoods of the emulator can then be used to perform Bayesian parameter inference on experimental data using standard approximate inference methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. While most neural likelihood estimation methods target continuous data, MNLE works with mixed data types, as typically obtained in decision-making experiments (e.g., binary decisions and associated continuous reaction times). We demonstrate MNLE on the classical drift-diffusion model (DDM) and compare its performance to a recently proposed method for SBI on DDMs, called likelihood approximation networks (LAN, Fengler et al. 2021). We show that MNLE is substantially more efficient than LANs, requiring up to six orders of magnitudes fewer model simulations to achieve comparable likelihood accuracy and evaluation time while providing the same level of flexibility. We include an implementation of our algorithm in the user-friendly open source package sbi.

                Animals have been proposed to abstract compact representations of a task's structure that could, in principle, support accelerated learning and flexible behavior. Whether and how such abstracted representations may be used to assign credit for inferred, but unobserved, relationships in structured environments are unknown. Here, we develop a novel hierarchical reversal-learning task and Bayesian learning model to assess the computational and neural mechanisms underlying how humans infer specific choice-outcome associations via structured knowledge. We find that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) efficiently represents hierarchically related choice-outcome associations governed by the same latent cause, using a generalized code to assign credit for both experienced and inferred outcomes. Furthermore, mPFC and lateral orbital frontal cortex track the inferred current "position" within a latent association space that generalizes over stimuli. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance both of tracking the current position in an abstracted task space and efficient, generalizable representations in prefrontal cortex for supporting flexible learning and inference in structured environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracting dynamical understanding from neural-mass models of mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                New brain atlases with high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage have rapidly advanced our knowledge of the brain's neural architecture, including the systematic variation of excitatory and inhibitory cell densities across the mammalian cortex. But understanding how the brain's microscale physiology shapes brain dynamics at the macroscale has remained a challenge. While physiologically based mathematical models of brain dynamics are well placed to bridge this explanatory gap, their complexity can form a barrier to providing clear mechanistic interpretation of the dynamics they generate. In this work we develop a neural-mass model of the mouse cortex and show how bifurcation diagrams, which capture local dynamical responses to inputs and their variation across brain regions, can be used to understand the resulting whole-brain dynamics. We show that strong fits to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can be found in surprisingly simple dynamical regimes (including where all brain regions are confined to a stable fixed point) where regions are able to respond strongly to variations in their inputs, consistent with direct structural connections providing a strong constraint on functional connectivity in the anesthetized mouse. We also use bifurcation diagrams to show how perturbations to local excitatory and inhibitory coupling strengths across the cortex, constrained by cell-density data, provide spatially dependent constraints on resulting cortical activity, and support a greater diversity of coincident dynamical regimes. Our work illustrates methods for visualizing and interpreting model performance in terms of underlying dynamical mechanisms, an approach that is crucial for building explanatory and physiologically grounded models of the dynamical principles that underpin large-scale brain activity.

                Throughout early adulthood, the anatomical and functional maturation of PFC circuitry continues under the influence of multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors, most notably electrical activity, and molecular cues. We previously showed that the extracellular matrix protein reelin orchestrates the structural and functional maturation of deep layers medial PFC (mPFC) pyramidal neurons. Additionally, we reported that reelin haploinsufficiency is associated to prefrontal disruptions of long-term memory retention thereby illustrating the eminent role of reelin in cognitive maturation of the PFC. Prefrontal maturation follows a sex-specific developmental pattern, supporting the existence of sexual differences in the morphology-functional properties PFC. Here, we interrogated the role of reelin in the functional maturation of excitatory networks in the mPFC. The developmental trajectory of reelin's expression and deep layer pyramidal neurons synaptic plasticity was tracked in the mPFC of male and female mice, from the juvenile period to adulthood. To assess the role of reelin in both sexes, wild-type and heterozygous reeler mice (HRM) were compared. The results show that the maturational profile of reelin expression in the mPFC is sex-dependent and that the developmental trajectory of long-term potentiation is different between wild-type males and females. These data demonstrate reelin influence on prefrontal synapses is sex and period specific.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of perceiving and interpreting engraved prehistoric patterns as human production: effect of archaeological expertise.</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that engraved abstract patterns dating from the Middle and Lower Palaeolithic served as means of representation and communication. Identifying the brain regions involved in visual processing of these engravings can provide insights into their function. In this study, brain activity was measured during perception of the earliest known Palaeolithic engraved patterns and compared to natural patterns mimicking human-made engravings. Participants were asked to categorise marks as being intentionally made by humans or due to natural processes (e.g. erosion, root etching). To simulate the putative familiarity of our ancestors with the marks, the responses of expert archaeologists and control participants were compared, allowing characterisation of the effect of previous knowledge on both behaviour and brain activity in perception of the marks. Besides a set of regions common to both groups and involved in visual analysis and decision-making, the experts exhibited greater activity in the inferior part of the lateral occipital cortex, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and medial thalamic regions. These results are consistent with those reported in visual expertise studies, and confirm the importance of the integrative visual areas in the perception of the earliest abstract engravings. The attribution of a natural rather than human origin to the marks elicited greater activity in the salience network in both groups, reflecting the uncertainty and ambiguity in the perception of, and decision-making for, natural patterns. The activation of the salience network might also be related to the process at work in the attribution of an intention to the marks. The primary visual area was not specifically involved in the visual processing of engravings, which argued against its central role in the emergence of engraving production.

                Autobiographical memory (AM) involves a rich phenomenological re-experiencing of a spatio-temporal event from the past, which is challenging to objectively quantify. The Autobiographical Interview (AI; Levine et al., 2002, Psychology & Aging) is a manualized performance-based assessment designed to quantify episodic (internal) and semantic (external) features of recalled and verbally conveyed prior experiences. The AI has been widely adopted yet has not undergone a comprehensive psychometric validation. We investigated the reliability, validity, association to individual differences measures, and factor structure in healthy younger and older adults (N=352). Evidence for the AI's reliability was strong: the subjective scoring protocol showed high inter-rater reliability and previously identified age effects were replicated. Internal consistency across timepoints was robust, suggesting stability in recollection. Central to our validation, internal AI scores were positively correlated with standard, performance-based measures of episodic memory, demonstrating convergent validity. The two-factor structure for the AI was not well-supported by confirmatory factor analysis. Adjusting internal and external detail scores for the number of words spoken (detail density) improved trait estimation of AM performance. Overall, the AI demonstrated sound psychometric properties for inquiry into the qualities of autobiographical remembering.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The what and where of synchronous sound perception</a></h4>

              
                Sound localization and identification are challenging in acoustically rich environments. The relation between these two processes is still poorly understood. As natural sound-sources rarely occur exactly simultaneously, we wondered whether the auditory system could identify ('what') and localize ('where') two spatially separated sounds with synchronous onsets. While listeners typically report hearing a single source at an average location, one study found that both sounds may be accurately localized if listeners are explicitly being told two sources exist. We here tested whether simultaneous source identification (one vs. two) and localization is possible, by letting listeners choose to make either one or two head-orienting saccades to the perceived location(s). Results show that listeners could identify two sounds only when presented on different sides of the head, and that identification accuracy increased with their spatial separation. Notably, listeners were unable to accurately localize either sound, irrespective of whether one or two sounds were identified. Instead, the first (or only) response always landed near the average location, while second responses were unrelated to the targets. We conclude that localization of synchronous sounds in the absence of prior information is impossible. We discuss that the putative cortical 'what' pathway may not transmit relevant information to the 'where' pathway. We examine how a broadband interaural correlation cue could help to correctly identify the presence of two sounds without being able to localize them. We propose that the persistent averaging behavior reveals that the 'where' system intrinsically assumes that synchronous sounds originate from a single source.

                The production of behavioural flexibility requires the coordination and integration of information from across the brain, by the dorsal striatum. In particular, the striatal cholinergic system is thought to be important for the modulation of striatal activity. Research from animal literature has shown that chemical inactivation of the dorsal striatum leads to impairments in reversal learning. Furthermore, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy work has shown that the striatal cholinergic system is also important for reversal learning in humans. Here, we aim to assess whether the state of the dorsal striatal cholinergic system at rest is related to flexible behaviour in reversal learning. We provide preliminary results showing that variability in choline in the dorsal striatum is significantly related to both the number perseverative and regressive errors that participants make, and their rate of learning from positive and negative prediction errors. These findings, in line with previous work, suggest the resting state of dorsal striatal cholinergic system has important implications for producing flexible behaviour. However, these results also suggest the system may have heterogeneous functionality across different types of tasks measuring behavioural flexibility. These findings provide a starting point for further interrogation into understanding the functional role of the striatal cholinergic system in flexibility.

                Cognitive ageing is a complex process which requires multimodal approach. Neuroimaging can provide insights into brain morphology, functional organization and vascular dynamics. However, most neuroimaging studies of ageing have focused on each imaging modality separately, limiting the understanding of interrelations between processes identified by different modalities and the interpretation of neural correlates of cognitive decline in ageing. Here, we used linked independent component analysis as a data-driven multimodal approach to jointly analyze magnetic resonance imaging of grey matter density, cerebrovascular, and functional network topographies. Neuroimaging and behavioural data (n = 215) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience study were used, containing healthy subjects aged 18 to 88. In the output components, fusion was found between structural and cerebrovascular topographies in multiple components with cognitive-relevance across the lifespan. A component reflecting global atrophy with regional cerebrovascular changes and a component reflecting right frontoparietal network activity were correlated with fluid intelligence over and above age and gender. No meaningful fusion between functional network topography and structural or cerebrovascular signals was observed. We propose that integrating multiple neuroimaging modalities allows to better characterize brain pattern variability and to differentiate brain changes in healthy ageing.

                In humans and rodents, the protracted development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) throughout adolescence represents a time for marked vulnerability towards environmental adversities, such as stress or drug exposure. We previously showed that the extracellular matrix protein reelin is an instrumental synaptic modulator that shapes medial PFC (mPFC) circuitry during maturation and is a critical mediator of the vulnerability to environmental stress. Emerging evidence highlight the role of the endocannabinoid system in the postnatal maturation of the PFC and reelin deficiency influences behavioral abnormalities caused by heavy consumption of THC during adolescence. Could the reelin-dependent maturation of prefrontal networks may be vulnerable to cannabinoid exposure during adolescence? To explore this hypothesis, we studied the effects of a single in-vivo exposure to a synthetic cannabinoid on reelin expression and mPFC functions in adolescent male mice. The results show that a single cannabinoid exposure mimics reelin haploinsufficiency by decreasing prefrontal reelin expression in a layer-specific pattern without changing its transcriptional levels. Furthermore, this treatment impeded synaptic plasticity: adolescent cannabinoid lowered long-term potentiation to the magnitude observed in age-matched reelin haploinsufficient males. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that changes in the mRNA levels of NMDARs does not account for the reduction of TBS-LTP. Together, the data show that exposure to cannabinoid during adolescence phenocopies reelin haploinsufficiency and further identifies reelin as a key component of the vulnerability of PFC to environmental insults.
