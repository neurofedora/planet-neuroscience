	<p>Background: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder affecting approximately 0.32% of the global population, according to the World Health Organization. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat this condition by inhibiting D2 dopamine and 5HT2 serotonin receptors. The selection of the appropriate mode of delivery for these drugs is based on factors such as patient adherence, clinical presentation, and patient preferences. However, additional drivers of treatment selection are required in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. NLR, a cost-effective biomarker of inflammation, has increased in several psychiatric conditions and may represent a valid method for studying the inflammatory stage in schizophrenia, relapse, and the first episode of psychosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there are any variations in NLR values between patients given oral antipsychotics and those given long-acting antipsychotics. Methods: The study included 50 individuals with schizophrenia, either acute or in the follow-up phase. NLR was obtained by calculating the ratio of absolute neutrophil count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L) and absolute lymphocyte count (cells/&amp;amp;mu;L). Results: Patients on long-acting antipsychotics exhibited significantly lower mean NLR scores (1.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.7) compared to those on oral antipsychotics (2.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: NLR appears promising as a neuroinflammatory biomarker. This study reveals significantly lower NLR values in patients on long-acting antipsychotics, which may signify reduced systemic inflammation and improved adherence.</p>

	<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by a weakening of the small- and medium-sized cerebral arteries, as their smooth muscle cells are progressively replaced with acellular amyloid &amp;amp;beta;, increasing vessel fragility and vulnerability to microhemorrhage. In this context, an aberrant overactivation of the complement system would further aggravate this process. The surface protein CD59 protects most cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity, but expression levels can fluctuate due to disease and varying cell types. The degree to which CD59 protects human cerebral vascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells from complement-induced cytotoxicity has not yet been determined. To address this shortcoming, we selectively blocked the activity of HCSM-expressed CD59 with an antibody, and challenged the cells with complement, then measured cellular viability. Unblocked HCSM cells proved resistant to all tested concentrations of complement, and this resistance decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of anti-CD59 antibody. Complete CD59 blockage, however, did not result in a total loss of cellular viability, suggesting that additional factors may have some protective functions. Taken together, this implies that CD59 plays a predominant role in HCSM cellular protection against complement-induced cytotoxicity. The overexpression of CD59 could be an effective means of protecting these cells from excessive complement system activity, with consequent reductions in the incidence of microhemorrhage. The precise extent to which cellular repair mechanisms and other complement repair proteins contribute to this resistance has yet to be fully elucidated.</p>

	<p>This review aims to analyze the current literature to identify articles related to the role of nurses and, in general, the nursing management of patients suffering from medication overuse headache (MOH), a globally spread disease. We specifically argue for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management, such as multidisciplinary team approaches, holistic treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise. For this review, we investigated international scientific databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Embase, in the period between 2000 and 2024. We observed a wealth of scientific articles related to MOH, but a poverty of articles relating to the nursing management of headache. The research included the presence of academic-level training for nurses, whereas there are few institutions that train competent professionals in both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of MOH patients. Nursing assessment and assistance strategies are indicated to plan tailored treatment paths related to the specific needs of these patients.</p>

	<p>People seeking asylum are susceptible to head injury (HI) due to exposure to various forms of violence including war, torture, or interpersonal violence. Yet, the extents to which clinicians assess HI, and if so, what the associated characteristics are, are not well known. We analyzed 200 U.S.-based medico-legal affidavits using descriptive, multivariate regression, and thematic analysis. Head injury was documented in 38% of affidavits. Those who experienced physical violence were eight times likelier to experience HI than those who did not experience physical violence. Five themes emerged: (1) HI occurred commonly in the context of interpersonal violence (44%), followed by militarized violence (33%); (2) mechanisms of HI included direct blows to the head and asphyxiation, suggesting potential for both traumatic brain injury and brain injury from oxygen deprivation; (3) HI was often recurrent and concurrent with other physical injuries; (4) co-morbid psychiatric and post-concussive symptoms made it challenging to assess neurological and psychiatric etiologies; and (5) overall, there was a paucity of assessments and documentation of HI and sequelae. Among individuals assessed for asylum claims, HI is common, often recurrent, occurring in the context of interpersonal violence, and concurrent with psychological and other physical trauma. Physical violence is an important risk factor for HI, which should be assessed when physical violence is reported.</p>

	<p>Palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy may lead to dysfunction of the auditory tube due to a propensity for infection, potentially giving rise to otitis media. This is a quantitative and longitudinal study, developed from 2019 to 2021, at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). The studied sample comprised 15 participants aged 5 to 12 years (mean 7.9 years), 12 male and 3 female, arranged into two groups: children diagnosed with pharyngeal and/or palatine tonsil hypertrophy who were candidates for surgery (G1), and children who were later evaluated after surgery (G2). As part of the test, an otoscopy and measurements of logoaudiometry, pure-tone threshold audiometry, wideband tympanometry (ambient and peak pressure), and otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs and DPOAEs, both at ambient and peak pressure) were all performed. There were statistically significant differences between phases in pure-tone audiometry, in terms of 226 Hz tympanometry, wideband tympanometry in peak pressure conditions, in the amplitude measurement TEOAEs in both pressure conditions, in DPOAEs in ambient pressure conditions, and in the signal/noise measurement in both pressures in DPOAEs. Overall, it was found that hearing tests were different for subjects with palatine and pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy compared to the post-surgical group.</p>

                Background Climate change, largely triggered by human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, seems unstoppable. There was a strong rebound of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, the preponderant GHG in terms of contribution to global warming, around the world after the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, there is still no widely accepted international treaty on curbing the anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O, the second and third predominant GHG, respectively, so far. Thereby, prima facie, in respect to mitigating climate change, currently, humans have no aces up their sleeves. It seems that current temperature rise is not high enough to take alarm until the occurrence of tipping point. Policy Climate-related international treaties, such as 2016 Paris agreement, are compromises among conflicting geopolitical pressures. However, currently, the climate treaties show little mandatory binding force on the signatories who are able to violate and then get off scot-free, thus may end up like a nostrum. Throughout the European history, I find that the only way, if at all, to achieve the peace or obedience of a treaty is via balancing powers, embodied in Bismarck’s Realpolitik of Germany and Richelieu’s Raison d'état of France. Similarly, the Chinese history in East Asia proved the significance of unadulterated ideological neutrality and Darwinian adaptability in the kaleidoscope of evolving circumstances in maintaining order and enforcement of international treaties through balancing the power of rivalries to constrain ever-recurring challengers for equilibrium. Recommendations A successful policy needs to make a thorough analysis of all relevant factors to form a long-term strategic notion. Then, statesmen need to distill an array of nebulous, always contradictory options into a tenacious, controllable direction. Thereby, I suggest that, for better curbing global warming, climate agreements or climate club be incorporated into an overall geopolitical framework among the international communities.

                Background This study delves into the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam, a subject critical to understanding the broader role of educators in shaping societal and educational values. Through an analysis of song lyrics, the research aims to uncover how the professional identity of teachers is reflected and shaped within the unique cultural context of Vietnam. Methods A qualitative approach underpins this study, utilizing theoretical frameworks such as Constructivist Grounded Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Twelve Vietnamese songs specifically about teachers were selected for analysis. These songs were carefully chosen to provide a diverse and representative sample of the cultural portrayal of teachers in Vietnam. The project spanned from January 1st until February 21st, 2024. Results The analysis revealed several key themes that collectively characterize the professional identity of Vietnamese teachers. These include ‘Sacrifice and Dedication,’ highlighting the commitment and perseverance of teachers; ‘Respect and Reverence,’ reflecting the deep societal respect for the teaching profession; ‘Nurturing and Inspiration,’ depicting teachers as cultivators of dreams and moral values; ‘Enduring Impact and Memory,’ emphasizing the long-lasting influence of teachers on their students; ‘Teacher as a Guiding Figure,’ portraying the role of teachers as key moral and cultural guides; and ‘Emotional Connection and Affection,’ underlining the deep emotional bonds between teachers and students. Conclusions The study’s findings underscore the significant role of cultural and emotional factors in shaping the professional identity of teachers in Vietnam. These themes highlight the multifaceted role of teachers that transcends academic teaching, involving personal development, cultural transmission, and emotional nurturing. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, suggesting that educational policies and teacher education programs need to consider these cultural and emotional dimensions. Additionally, the study highlights the power of cultural artifacts, like music, in reflecting and shaping societal values and professional identities.

                Introduction Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to preventive healthcare. India’s vast rural population amplifies the challenge, demanding immediate action. Despite advancements, cervical cancer remains prevalent among underserved rural communities, hindered by barriers to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) screening uptake, including socioeconomic and financial constraints. This study aims to evaluate the economic challenges encountered by rural women when accessing HPV screening. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1502 women aged 30 to 45 in Pondicherry, India, utilizing the Andersen Model as a conceptual framework. Household questionnaires gathered data on HPV screening expenses, including patient travel costs, productivity loss, and companion costs. The analysis utilized regression models, to identify the factors impacting the economic challenges associated with accessing HPV screening. Results Employment status and higher education significantly increase total costs by 73.483 (p < 0.001) and 90.169 units (p < 0.001) respectively. Income level, though with a minimal coefficient (B = 0.000), shows a significant effect (p = 0.019) on total costs. Longer travel hours raise costs by 5.129 units (p < 0.001), while having a companion increases costs by 106.095 units (p = 0.004). Prolonged patient time at Primary Health Center (PHC) contributes to a 2.357-unit increase in costs (p < 0.001). Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted economic challenges faced by rural populations accessing HPV screening for cervical cancer prevention in India. Notwithstanding diverse demographics and varying proximity to healthcare facilities, individuals encounter significant barriers such as travel time and associated costs. Addressing these challenges necessitates targeted interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities and improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations, thereby advancing cervical cancer prevention efforts and promoting health equity in rural communities.

                Objectives The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify the optimal timing for immunizing pregnant women to confer the most protection by reducing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness in infants less than 6 months of age. Currently, there are gaps in research regarding the timing of administration during the gestational period to provide maximum immunogenicity to the infant. The research question being addressed is: ‘When considering immunization of pregnant mothers with the influenza vaccine, implementing a vaccination program during which trimester in pregnancy would optimize benefits for infants less than 6 months of age in terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness?’ Design Systematic review/Meta-analysis Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) and observational studies comparing health outcomes of infants and children up to 6 months of age born to women who received inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy with mothers who did not receive the vaccine or received a control vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants. Secondary outcome measures included influenza –like illness diagnosed by a clinician and acute respiratory illness. Results 7 studies were included: 2 primary RCT’s and 5 observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies).5 of the 7 studies were suitable to be included in the quantitative synthesis part and and were compared. Forrest plot analysis revealed that vaccinating pregnant mothers in the second and third trimester when compared with any trimester (1,2 and 3) (OR 0.18 vs. 0.65) conferred less protection, promoting vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant mothers in the first trimester conferred greater protection to infants than any other trimester.

                A common outcome of analysing RNA-Seq data is the detection of biological pathways with significantly altered activity between the conditions under investigation. Whilst many strategies test for over-representation of genes, showing changed expression within pre-defined gene-sets, these analyses typically do not account for gene-gene interactions encoded by pathway topologies, and are not able to directly predict the directional change of pathway activity. To address these issues we have developed sSNAPPY,now available as an R/Bioconductor package, which leverages pathway topology information to compute pathway perturbation scores and predict the direction of change across a set of pathways. Here, we demonstrate the use of sSNAPPY by applying the method to public scRNA-seq data, derived from ovarian cancer patient tissues collected before and after chemotherapy. Not only were we able to predict the direction of pathway perturbations discussed in the original study, but sSNAPPY was also able to detect significant changes of other biological processes, yielding far greater insight into the response to treatment. sSNAPPY represents a novel pathway analysis strategy that takes into consideration pathway topology to predict impacted biology pathways, both within related samples and across treatment groups. In addition to not relying on differentially expressed genes, the method and associated R package offers important flexibility and provides powerful visualisation tools.

                <p>by Audrey Duval, Quentin J. Leclerc, Didier Guillemot, Laura Temime, Lulla Opatowski</p>

Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. Empirical individual contact data provide unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity and are increasingly available, but are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in healthcare settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals’ wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recording bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. We validate our algorithm using data collected during the i-Bird study, and compare the empirical and reconstructed networks. The algorithm was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first–third quartiles observed: 0.54–0.64; synthetic: 0.52–0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39–0.50 vs 0.37–0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The algorithm consistently recreated unobserved contacts to generate full reconstructed networks for the LTCF. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other HCS using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.

                <p>by Jente Willaert, Kaat Desloovere, Anja Van Campenhout, Lena H. Ting, Friedl De Groote</p>

Balance impairments are common in cerebral palsy. When balance is perturbed by backward support surface translations, children with cerebral palsy have increased co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior muscle as compared to typically developing children. However, it is unclear whether increased muscle co-activation is a compensation strategy to improve balance control or is a consequence of reduced reciprocal inhibition. During translational perturbations, increased joint stiffness due to co-activation might aid balance control by resisting movement of the body with respect to the feet. In contrast, during rotational perturbations, increased joint stiffness will hinder balance control as it couples body to platform rotation. Therefore, we expect increased muscle co-activation in response to rotational perturbations if co-activation is caused by reduced reciprocal inhibition but not if it is merely a compensation strategy. We perturbed standing balance by combined backward translational and toe-up rotational perturbations in 20 children with CP and 20 TD children. Perturbations induced forward followed by backward movement of the center of mass. We evaluated reactive muscle activity and the relation between center of mass movement and reactive muscle activity using a linear feedback model based on center of mass kinematics. In typically developing children, perturbations induced plantar flexor balance correcting muscle activity followed by tibialis anterior balance correcting muscle activity, which was driven by center of mass movement. In children with cerebral palsy, the switch from plantar flexor to tibialis anterior activity was less pronounced than in typically developing children due to increased muscle co-activation of the plantar flexors and tibialis anterior throughout the response. Our results thus suggest that a reduction in reciprocal inhibition causes muscle co-activation in reactive standing balance in children with CP.

                <p>by Seoyoung Ahn, Hossein Adeli, Gregory J. Zelinsky</p>

Humans are extremely robust in our ability to perceive and recognize objects—we see faces in tea stains and can recognize friends on dark streets. Yet, neurocomputational models of primate object recognition have focused on the initial feed-forward pass of processing through the ventral stream and less on the top-down feedback that likely underlies robust object perception and recognition. Aligned with the generative approach, we propose that the visual system actively facilitates recognition by reconstructing the object hypothesized to be in the image. Top-down attention then uses this reconstruction as a template to bias feedforward processing to align with the most plausible object hypothesis. Building on auto-encoder neural networks, our model makes detailed hypotheses about the appearance and location of the candidate objects in the image by reconstructing a complete object representation from potentially incomplete visual input due to noise and occlusion. The model then leverages the best object reconstruction, measured by reconstruction error, to direct the bottom-up process of selectively routing low-level features, a top-down biasing that captures a core function of attention. We evaluated our model using the MNIST-C (handwritten digits under corruptions) and ImageNet-C (real-world objects under corruptions) datasets. Not only did our model achieve superior performance on these challenging tasks designed to approximate real-world noise and occlusion viewing conditions, but also better accounted for human behavioral reaction times and error patterns than a standard feedforward Convolutional Neural Network. Our model suggests that a complete understanding of object perception and recognition requires integrating top-down and attention feedback, which we propose is an object reconstruction.

                <p>by Benjamin V. Ineichen, Eva Furrer, Servan L. Grüninger, Wolfgang E. Zürrer, Malcolm R. Macleod</p>

There is an ongoing debate about the value of animal experiments to inform medical practice, yet there are limited data on how well therapies developed in animal studies translate to humans. We aimed to assess 2 measures of translation across various biomedical fields: (1) The proportion of therapies which transition from animal studies to human application, including involved timeframes; and (2) the consistency between animal and human study results. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review, including English systematic reviews that evaluated the translation of therapies from animals to humans. Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched from inception until August 1, 2023. We assessed the proportion of therapeutic interventions advancing to any human study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and regulatory approval. We meta-analyzed the concordance between animal and human studies. The risk of bias was probed using a 10-item checklist for systematic reviews. We included 122 articles, describing 54 distinct human diseases and 367 therapeutic interventions. Neurological diseases were the focus of 32% of reviews. The overall proportion of therapies progressing from animal studies was 50% to human studies, 40% to RCTs, and 5% to regulatory approval. Notably, our meta-analysis showed an 86% concordance between positive results in animal and clinical studies. The median transition times from animal studies were 5, 7, and 10 years to reach any human study, an RCT, and regulatory approval, respectively. We conclude that, contrary to widespread assertions, the rate of successful animal-to-human translation may be higher than previously reported. Nonetheless, the low rate of final approval indicates potential deficiencies in the design of both animal studies and early clinical trials. To ameliorate the efficacy of translating therapies from bench to bedside, we advocate for enhanced study design robustness and the reinforcement of generalizability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002662">A mechanical transition from tension to buckling underlies the jigsaw puzzle shape morphogenesis of histoblasts in the Drosophila epidermis</a></h4>

The polygonal shape of cells in proliferating epithelia is a result of the tensile forces of the cytoskeletal cortex and packing geometry set by the cell cycle. In the larval <i>Drosophila</i> epidermis, two cell populations, histoblasts and larval epithelial cells, compete for space as they grow on a limited body surface. They do so in the absence of cell divisions. We report a striking morphological transition of histoblasts during larval development, where they change from a tensed network configuration with straight cell outlines at the level of adherens junctions to a highly folded morphology. The apical surface of histoblasts shrinks while their growing adherens junctions fold, forming deep lobules. Volume increase of growing histoblasts is accommodated basally, compensating for the shrinking apical area. The folded geometry of apical junctions resembles elastic buckling, and we show that the imbalance between the shrinkage of the apical domain of histoblasts and the continuous growth of junctions triggers buckling. Our model is supported by laser dissections and optical tweezer experiments together with computer simulations. Our analysis pinpoints the ability of histoblasts to store mechanical energy to a much greater extent than most other epithelial cell types investigated so far, while retaining the ability to dissipate stress on the hours time scale. Finally, we propose a possible mechanism for size regulation of histoblast apical size through the lateral pressure of the epidermis, driven by the growth of cells on a limited surface. Buckling effectively compacts histoblasts at their apical plane and may serve to avoid physical harm to these adult epidermis precursors during larval life. Our work indicates that in growing nondividing cells, compressive forces, instead of tension, may drive cell morphology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002652">Disruption of dopamine D2/D3 system function impairs the human ability to understand the mental states of other people</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bianca A. Schuster, Sophie Sowden, Alicia J. Rybicki, Dagmar S. Fraser, Clare Press, Lydia Hickman, Peter Holland, Jennifer L. Cook</p>

Difficulties in reasoning about others’ mental states (i.e., mentalising/Theory of Mind) are highly prevalent among disorders featuring dopamine dysfunctions (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) and significantly affect individuals’ quality of life. However, due to multiple confounding factors inherent to existing patient studies, currently little is known about whether these sociocognitive symptoms originate from aberrant dopamine signalling or from psychosocial changes unrelated to dopamine. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of dopamine in modulating mentalising in a sample of healthy volunteers. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure to test the effect of the D2/D3 antagonist haloperidol on mental state attribution, using an adaptation of the Heider and Simmel (1944) animations task. On 2 separate days, once after receiving 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after receiving placebo, 33 healthy adult participants viewed and labelled short videos of 2 triangles depicting mental state (involving mentalistic interaction wherein 1 triangle intends to cause or act upon a particular mental state in the other, e.g., surprising) and non-mental state (involving reciprocal interaction without the intention to cause/act upon the other triangle’s mental state, e.g., following) interactions. Using Bayesian mixed effects models, we observed that haloperidol decreased accuracy in labelling both mental and non-mental state animations. Our secondary analyses suggest that dopamine modulates inference from mental and non-mental state animations via independent mechanisms, pointing towards 2 putative pathways underlying the dopaminergic modulation of <i>mental</i> state attribution: action representation and a shared mechanism supporting mentalising and emotion recognition. We conclude that dopaminergic pathways impact Theory of Mind, at least indirectly. Our results have implications for the neurochemical basis of sociocognitive difficulties in patients with dopamine dysfunctions and generate new hypotheses about the specific dopamine-mediated mechanisms underlying social cognition.

The inhibitory effect of the peptide is at the level of stable β-catenin, and hence, it can attenuate Wnt signaling in mutant contexts that lead to stable β-catenin or can even stabilize mutations within β-catenin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89782">Base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA diminish the disease-causing mutation in Huntington’s disease</a></h4>

              
                An expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>) causes Huntington’s disease (HD). Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering <i>HTT</i> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased in the liver by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97902">A CDK1 phosphorylation site on Drosophila PAR-3 regulates neuroblast polarisation and sensory organ formation</a></h4>

              
                The generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of <i>Drosophila</i>, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation of Bazooka, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. In some tissular contexts, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. In neuroblasts, Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation. Serine180 phosphomutants also affect the specification and binary cell fate determination of sensory organ precursors as well as Baz localisation during their asymmetric cell divisions. Finally, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates Serine-S180 and an equivalent Serine on human PAR-3 <i>in vitro</i>.

                Compared with lowlander migrants, native Tibetans have a higher reproductive success at high altitude though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compared the transcriptome and histology of full-term placentas between native Tibetans and Han migrants. We found that the placental trophoblast shows the largest expression divergence between Tibetans and Han, and Tibetans show decreased immune response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Remarkably, we detected a sex-biased expression divergence, where the male-infant placentas show a greater between-population difference than the female-infant placentas. The umbilical cord plays a key role in the sex-biased expression divergence, which is associated with the higher birth weight of the male newborns of Tibetans. We also identified adaptive histological changes in the male-infant placentas of Tibetans, including larger umbilical artery wall and umbilical artery intima and media, and fewer syncytial knots. These findings provide valuable insights into the sex-biased adaptation of human populations, with significant implications for medical and genetic studies of human reproduction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87297">Brain age has limited utility as a biomarker for capturing fluid cognition in older individuals</a></h4>

              
                One well-known biomarker candidate that supposedly helps capture fluid cognition is Brain Age, or a predicted value based on machine-learning models built to predict chronological age from brain MRI. To formally evaluate the utility of Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition, we built 26 age-prediction models for Brain Age based on different combinations of MRI modalities, using the Human Connectome Project in Aging (n=504, 36–100 years old). First, based on commonality analyses, we found a large overlap between Brain Age and chronological age: Brain Age could uniquely add only around 1.6% in explaining variation in fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Second, the age-prediction models that performed better at predicting chronological age did NOT necessarily create better Brain Age for capturing fluid cognition over and above chronological age. Instead, better-performing age-prediction models created Brain Age that overlapped larger with chronological age, up to around 29% out of 32%, in explaining fluid cognition. Third, Brain Age missed around 11% of the total variation in fluid cognition that could have been explained by the brain variation. That is, directly predicting fluid cognition from brain MRI data (instead of relying on Brain Age and chronological age) could lead to around a 1/3-time improvement of the total variation explained. Accordingly, we demonstrated the limited utility of Brain Age as a biomarker for fluid cognition and made some suggestions to ensure the utility of Brain Age in explaining fluid cognition and other phenotypes of interest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95209">A microRNA that controls the emergence of embryonic movement</a></h4>

              
                Movement is a key feature of animal systems, yet its embryonic origins are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in <i>Drosophila</i> focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the <i>Drosophila</i> miRNA <i>miR-2b-1</i> plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA in situs, genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that miR-2b-1 influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term <i><span class="underline">Mo</span>vement Modula<span class="underline">tor</span></i> (<i>Motor</i>) – as a genetic target that mechanistically links <i>miR-2b-1</i> to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of <i>miR-2b-1</i> expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that <i>miR-2b-1</i> affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in <i>Drosophila</i> as well as in other species.

">Dorso-ventral hippocampal neural assemblies are preferentially reactivated during NREM sleep following an aversive experience</a></h4>

              
                Sleep plays a crucial role in memory stabilization. In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep consolidate spatial memories through place cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal-ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating or segregating contextual and valence information. To test this, we recorded the electrophysiological activity in the dHPC and vHPC in rats during reward and aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.

                The population receptive field method, which measures the region in visual space that elicits a BOLD signal in a voxel in retinotopic cortex, is a powerful tool for investigating the functional organization of human visual cortex with fMRI (Dumoulin & Wandell, 2008). However, recent work has shown that population receptive field (pRF) estimates for early retinotopic visual areas can be biased and unreliable, especially for voxels representing the fovea. Here, we show that a 'log-bar' stimulus that is logarithmically warped along the eccentricity dimension produces more reliable estimates of pRF size and location than the traditional moving bar stimulus. The log-bar stimulus was better able to identify pRFs near the foveal representation, and pRFs were smaller in size, consistent with simulation estimates of receptive field sizes in the fovea.

                White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly detected on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, occurring in both typical aging and Alzheimer's disease. Despite their frequent appearance and their association with cognitive decline, the molecular factors contributing to WMHs remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of two commonly affected brain regions with coincident AD pathology--frontal subcortical white matter (frontal-WM) and occipital subcortical white matter (occipital-WM)--and compared with age-matched healthy controls. Through RNA-sequencing in frontal- and occipital-WM bulk tissues, we identified an upregulation of genes associated with brain vasculature function in AD white matter. To further elucidate vasculature-specific transcriptomic features, we performed RNA-seq analysis on blood vessels isolated from these white matter regions, which revealed an upregulation of genes related to protein folding pathways. Finally, comparing gene expression profiles between AD individuals with high- versus low-WMH burden showed an increased expression of pathways associated with immune function. Taken together, our study characterizes the diverse molecular profiles of white matter changes in AD compared to normal aging and provides new mechanistic insights processes underlying AD-related WMHs.

                Assays for quantifying aggregated and phosphorylated (S129) human -synuclein protein are widely used to evaluate pathological burden in patients suffering from synucleinopathy disorders. Many of these assays, however, do not cross-react with mouse -synuclein or exhibit poor sensitivity for this target, which is problematic considering the preponderance of mouse models at the forefront of pre-clinical -synuclein research. In this project, we addressed this unmet need by reformulating two existing AlphaLISA SureFire Ultra total and pS129 -synuclein assay kits to yield robust and ultrasensitive (LLoQ [&le;]0.5pg/mL) quantification of mouse and human wild-type and pS129 -synuclein protein. We then employed these assays, together with the BioLegend -synuclein aggregate ELISA, to assess the relationship between -synuclein S129 phosphorylation and aggregation in different mouse brain tissue preparations. Overall, we highlight the compatibility of these new immunoassays with rodent models and demonstrate their potential to advance knowledge surrounding -synuclein phosphorylation and aggregation in synucleinopathies.

                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) that increase its kinase activity are strongly linked to genetic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the regulation of endogenous wild-type (WT) LRRK2 kinase activity remains poorly understood, despite its frequent elevation in idiopathic PD (iPD) patients. Various stressors such as mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal dyshomeostasis, or vesicle trafficking deficits can activate WT LRRK2 kinase, but the specific molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a lipid hydroperoxidation end-product, is a common biochemical response to these diverse stimuli. 4-HNE forms post-translational adducts with Cys2024 and Cys2025 in the kinase activation loop of WT LRRK2, significantly increasing its kinase activity. Additionally, we discovered that the 4-HNE responsible for regulating LRRK2 is generated by the action of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), making 15-LO an upstream regulator of the pathogenic hyperactivation of LRRK2 kinase activity. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of 15-LO prevents 4-HNE post-translational modification of LRRK2 kinase and its subsequent pathogenic hyperactivation. Therefore, 15-LO inhibitors, or methods to lower 4-HNE levels, or the targeting of Cys2024/2025 could provide new therapeutic strategies to modulate LRRK2 kinase activity and treat PD.

">Elevated phagocytic capacity directs innate spinal cord repair</a></h4>

              
                Immune cells elicit a continuum of transcriptional and functional states after spinal cord injury (SCI). In mammals, inefficient debris clearance and chronic inflammation impede recovery and overshadow pro-regenerative immune functions. We found that, unlike mammals, zebrafish SCI elicits transient immune activation and efficient debris clearance, without causing chronic inflammation. Single-cell transcriptomics and inducible genetic ablation showed zebrafish macrophages are highly phagocytic and required for regeneration. Cross-species comparisons between zebrafish and mammalian macrophages identified transcription and immune response regulator (tcim) as a macrophage-enriched zebrafish gene. Genetic deletion of zebrafish tcim impairs phagocytosis and regeneration, causes aberrant and chronic immune activation, and can be rescued by transplanting wild-type immune precursors into tcim mutants. Conversely, genetic expression of human TCIM accelerates debris clearance and regeneration by reprogramming myeloid precursors into activated phagocytes. This study establishes a central requirement for elevated phagocytic capacity to achieve innate spinal cord repair.

">Vestibular afferent neurons develop normally in the absence of quantal/glutamatergic input</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular nerve is comprised of neuron sub-groups with diverse functions related to their intrinsic biophysical properties. This diversity is partly due to differences in the types and numbers of low-voltage-gated potassium channels found in the neurons membranes. Expression for some low-voltage gated ion channels like KCNQ4 is upregulated during early post-natal development, suggesting that ion channel composition and neuronal diversity may be shaped by hair cell activity. This idea is consistent with recent work showing that glutamatergic input from hair cells is necessary for the normal diversification auditory neurons. To test if biophysical diversity is similarly dependent on glutamatergic input in vestibular neurons, we examined the maturation of the vestibular epithelium and ganglion neurons in Vglut3-ko mice whose hair cell synapses lack glutamate. Despite lacking glutamatergic input, the knockout mice showed no notable balance deficits and crossed challenging balance beams with little difficulty. Immunolabeling of the Vglut3-ko vestibular epithelia showed normal development as indicated by an identifiable striolar zone with calyceal terminals labeled by molecular marker calretinin, and normal expression of KCNQ4 by the end of the second post-natal week. We found similar numbers of Type I and Type II hair cells in the knockout and wildtype animals, regardless of epithelial zone. Thus, the presumably quiescent Type II hair cells are not cleared from the epithelium. Patch-clamp recordings showed that biophysical diversity of vestibular ganglion neurons in the Vglut3-ko mice is comparable to that found in wildtype controls, with a similar range firing patterns at both immature and juvenile ages. However, our results suggest a subtle biophysical alteration to the largest ganglion cells (putative somata of central zone afferents); those in the knockout had smaller net conductance and were more excitable than those in the wild type. Thus, unlike in the auditory nerve, glutamatergic signaling is unnecessary for producing biophysical diversity in vestibular ganglion neurons. And yet, because the input signals from vestibular hair cells are complex and not solely reliant on quantal release of glutamate, whether diversity of vestibular ganglion neurons is simply hardwired or regulated by a more complex set of input signals remains to be determined.

">Co-administration of midazolam and psilocybin: Differential effects on subjective quality versus memory of the psychedelic experience</a></h4>

              
                Aspects of the acute experience induced by the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin predict symptomatic relief in multiple psychiatric disorders and improved well-being in healthy participants, but whether these therapeutic effects are immediate or are based on memories of the experience is unclear. To examine this, we co-administered psilocybin (25 mg) with the amnestic benzodiazepine midazolam in 8 healthy participants and assayed the subjective quality of, and memory for, the dosing-day experience. We identified a midazolam dose that allowed a conscious psychedelic experience to occur while partially impairing memory for the experience. Furthermore, midazolam dose and memory impairment tended to associate inversely with salience, insight, and well-being induced by psilocybin. These data suggest a role for memory in therapeutically relevant behavioral effects occasioned by psilocybin. Because midazolam blocks memory by blocking cortical neural plasticity, it may also be useful for evaluating the contribution of the pro-neuroplastic properties of psychedelics to their therapeutic activity.

">Missing data approaches for longitudinal neuroimaging research: Examples from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study</a></h4>

              
                This paper addresses the challenges of managing missing values within expansive longitudinal neuroimaging datasets, using the specific example of data derived from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development ABCD study. The conventional listwise deletion method, while widely used, is not recommended due to the risk that substantial bias can potentially be introduced with this method. Unfortunately, recommended alternative practices can be challenging to implement with large data sets. In this paper, we advocate for the adoption of more sophisticated statistical methodologies, including multiple imputation, propensity score weighting, and full information maximum likelihood (FIML). Through practical examples and code using ABCD data, we illustrate some of the benefits and challenges of these methods, with a review of how these advanced methodologies bolster the robustness of analyses and contribute to the integrity of research findings in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience.

">Months-long stability of the head-direction system</a></h4>

              
                Spatial orientation is a universal ability that allows animals to navigate their environment. In mammals, the head-direction (HD) system is an essential component of the brain's navigation system, yet the stability of its underlying neuronal code remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in freely moving mice, we show that the internal organization of population activity in the HD system was preserved for several months. Furthermore, the HD system developed a unique mapping between its internal organization and spatial orientation in each environment. This was not affected by visits to other environments and was stabilized with experience. These findings demonstrate that stable neuronal code supports the sense of direction and forms long-lasting orientation memories.

">The developing Human Connectome Project fetal functional MRI release: Methods and data structures</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in fetal fMRI present a new opportunity for neuroscience to study functional human brain connectivity at the time of its emergence. Progress in the field however has been hampered by the lack of openly available datasets that can be exploited by researchers across disciplines to develop methods that would address the unique challenges associated with imaging and analysing functional brain in utero, such as unconstrained head motion, dynamically evolving geometric distortions, or inherently low signal-to-noise ratio. Here we describe the developing Human Connectome Project's release of the largest open access fetal fMRI dataset to date, containing 275 scans from 255 fetuses and spanning the period of 20.86 to 38.29 post-menstrual weeks. We present a systematic approach to its pre-processing, implementing multi-band soft SENSE reconstruction, dynamic distortion corrections via phase unwrapping method, slice-to-volume reconstruction and a tailored temporal filtering model, with attention to the prominent sources of structured noise in the in utero fMRI. The dataset is accompanied with an advanced registration infrastructure, enabling group-level data fusion, and contains outputs from the main intermediate processing steps. This allows for various levels of data exploration by the imaging and neuroscientific community, starting from the development of robust pipelines for anatomical and temporal corrections to methods for elucidating the development of functional connectivity in utero. By providing a high-quality template for further method development and benchmarking, the release of the dataset will help to advance fetal fMRI to its deserved and timely place at the forefront of the efforts to build a life-long connectome of the human brain.

">Pre-stimulus beta power encodes explicit and implicit perceptual biases in distinct cortical areas</a></h4>

              
                Perception is biased by expectations and previous actions. Pre-stimulus brain oscillations are a potential candidate for implementing biases in the brain. In two EEG studies on somatosensory near-threshold detection, we investigated the pre-stimulus neural correlates of an (implicit) previous choice bias and an explicit bias. The explicit bias was introduced by informing participants about stimulus probability on a single-trial level (volatile context) or block-wise (stable context). Behavioural analysis confirmed adjustments in the decision criterion and confidence ratings according to the cued probabilities and previous choice-induced biases. Pre-stimulus beta power with distinct sources in sensory and higher-order cortical areas predicted explicit and implicit biases, respectively, on a single subject level and partially mediated the impact of previous choice and stimulus probability on the detection response. We suggest that pre-stimulus beta oscillations in different brain areas are neural correlates of explicit and implicit biases in somatosensory perception.

">Mitochondrial oxidant stress promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation and spreading in mice with mutated glucocerebrosidase</a></h4>

              
                Mutations of the glucocerebrosidase-encoding gene, GBA1, are common risk factors for Parkinson's disease. Although only a minority of mutation-carrying individuals develops the disease, the mechanisms of neuronal vulnerability predisposing to pathology conversion remain largely unclear. In this study, heterozygous expression of a common glucocerebrosidase variant, namely the L444P mutation, was found to exacerbate alpha-synuclein aggregation and spreading in a mouse model of Parkinson-like pathology targeting neurons of the medullary vagal system. These neurons are primary sites of alpha-synuclein lesions in Parkinson's disease and were shown here to become more vulnerable to oxidative stress after L444P expression. Nitrative burden paralleled the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species within vagal neurons expressing mutated glucocerebrosidase, as indicated by pronounced accumulation of nitrated alpha-synuclein. A causal relationship linked mutation-induced oxidative stress to enhanced alpha-synuclein pathology that could indeed be rescued by neuronal overexpression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2. Further evidence supported a key involvement of mitochondria as sources of reactive oxygen species as well as targets of oxidative and nitrative damage within L444P-expressing neurons. Scavenging of oxygen species by superoxide dismutase 2 effectively counteracted deleterious nitrative reactions and prevented nitrated alpha-synuclein burden. Taken together, these findings support the conclusion that enhanced vulnerability to mitochondrial oxidative stress conferred by glucocerebrosidase mutations should be considered an important mechanism predisposing to Parkinson's disease pathology, particularly in brain regions targeted by alpha-synuclein aggregation and involved in alpha-synuclein spreading.

">Revealing heterogeneity in dementia using data-driven unsupervised clustering of cognitive profiles</a></h4>

              
                Dementia is characterized by a decline in memory and thinking that is significant enough to impair function in activities of daily living. Patients seen in dementia specialty clinics are highly heterogenous with a variety of different symptoms that progress at different rates. Recent research has focused on finding data-driven subtypes for revealing new insights into dementia's underlying heterogeneity, compared to analyzing the entire cohort as a single homogeneous group. However, existing studies on dementia subtyping suffer from the following limitations: (i) focusing on AD-related dementia only and not examining heterogeneity within dementia as a whole, (ii) using only cross-sectional baseline visit information for clustering and (iii) predominantly relying on expensive imaging biomarkers as features for clustering. In this study, we used a data-driven unsupervised clustering algorithm named SillyPutty, in combination with hierarchical clustering on neuropsychological assessment scores to estimate subtypes within a real-world clinical dementia cohort. We incorporated all longitudinal patient visits into our clustering analysis, instead of relying only on baseline visits, allowing us to explore the ongoing relationship between subtypes and disease progression over time. Results showed evidence of (i) subtypes with very mild or mild dementia being more heterogenous in their cognitive profiles and risk of disease progression.

">Tripartite organization of brain state dynamics underlying spoken narrative comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension involves the dynamic interplay of multiple cognitive processes, from basic sound perception, to linguistic encoding, and finally to complex semantic-conceptual interpretations. How the brain handles the diverse streams of information processing remains poorly understood. Applying Hidden Markov Modeling to fMRI data obtained during spoken narrative comprehension, we reveal that the whole brain networks predominantly oscillate within a tripartite latent state space. These states are respectively characterized by high activities in the sensory-motor (State #1), bilateral temporal (State #2), and DMN (State #3) regions, with State #2 acting as a transitional hub. The three states are selectively modulated by the acoustic, word-level semantic and clause-level semantic properties of the narrative. Moreover, the alignment with the best performer in brain state expression can predict participants' narrative comprehension scores. These results are reproducible with different brain network atlas and generalizable to two independent datasets consisting of young and older adults. Our study suggests that the brain underlies narrative comprehension by switching through a tripartite state space, with each state probably dedicated to a specific component of language faculty, and effective narrative comprehension relies on engaging those states in a timely manner.

                Mice are able to navigate an odor plume with a complex spatiotemporal structure in the dark to find the source of odorants. We developed a protocol to monitor behavior and record Ca2+ transients in dorsal CA1 stratum pyramidale neurons at the hippocampus (dCA1) in mice navigating an odor plume in a 50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm odor arena. Ca2+ transients were imaged by an epifluorescence miniscope focused through a GRIN lens on dCA1 neurons expressing the calcium sensor GCaMP6f in Thy1-GCaMP6f mice. We describe the behavioral protocol to train the mice to perform this odor plume navigation task in an automated odor arena. We provide the step-by-step procedure for the surgery for GRIN lens implantation and baseplate placement for imaging GCaMP6f in CA1. We provide information on real time tracking of the mouse position to automate the start of the trials and delivery of a sugar water reward. In addition, we provide information on the use of an Intan board to synchronize metadata describing the automation of the odor navigation task and frame times for the miniscope and a FLIR camera tracking mouse position. Moreover, we delineate the pipeline used to process GCaMP6f fluorescence movies by motion correction using NorMCorre followed by identification of regions of interest (ROIs) with EXTRACT. Finally, we describe use of artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning to decode spatial paths from CA1 neural ensemble activity to predict mouse navigation of the odor plume.

">Prosapip1 in the dorsal hippocampus mediates synaptic protein composition, long-term potentiation, and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Prosapip1 is a brain-specific protein localized to the postsynaptic density, where it promotes dendritic spine maturation in primary hippocampal neurons. However, nothing is known about the role of Prosapip1 in vivo. To examine this, we utilized the Cre-loxP system to develop a Prosapip1 neuronal knockout mouse. We found that Prosapip1 controls the synaptic localization of its binding partner SPAR, along with PSD-95 and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in the dorsal hippocampus (dHP). We next sought to identify the potential contribution of Prosapip1 to the activity and function of the NMDAR and found that Prosapip1 plays an important role in NMDAR-mediated transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the dHP. As LTP is the cellular hallmark of learning and memory, we examined the consequences of neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 on dHP-dependent memory. We found that global or dHP-specific neuronal knockout of Prosapip1 caused a deficit in learning and memory whereas developmental, locomotor, and anxiety phenotypes were normal. Taken together, Prosapip1 in the dHP promotes the proper localization of synaptic proteins which, in turn, facilitates LTP driving recognition, social, and spatial learning and memory.

">Single-Mitochondrion Sequencing Uncovers Distinct Mutational Patterns and Heteroplasmy Landscape in Mouse Astrocytes and Neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mitochondrial (mt) heteroplasmy can cause adverse biological consequences when deleterious mtDNA mutations accumulate disrupting normal mt-driven processes and cellular functions. To investigate the heteroplasmy of such mtDNA changes we developed a moderate throughput mt isolation procedure to quantify the mt single-nucleotide variant (SNV) landscape in individual mouse neurons and astrocytes In this study we amplified mt-genomes from 1,645 single mitochondria (mts) isolated from mouse single astrocytes and neurons to 1. determine the distribution and proportion of mt-SNVs as well as mutation pattern in specific target regions across the mt-genome,2. assess differences in mtDNA SNVs between neurons and astrocytes, and 3. Study cosegregation of variants in the mouse mtDNA. Results: 1. The data show that specific sites of the mt-genome are permissive to SNV presentation while others appear to be under stringent purifying selection. Nested hierarchical analysis at the levels of mitochondrion, cell, and mouse reveals distinct patterns of inter- and intra-cellular variation for mt-SNVs at different sites. 2. Further, differences in the SNV incidence were observed between mouse neurons and astrocytes for two mt-SNV 9027:G>A and 9419:C>T showing variation in the mutational propensity between these cell types. Purifying selection was observed in neurons as shown by the Ka/Ks statistic, suggesting that neurons are under stronger evolutionary constraint as compared to astrocytes. 3. Intriguingly, these data show strong linkage between the SNV sites at nucleotide positions 9027 and 9461. Conclusion: This study suggests that segregation as well as clonal expansion of mt-SNVs is specific to individual genomic loci, which is important foundational data in understanding of heteroplasmy and disease thresholds for mutation of pathogenic variants.

">Regional Brain Entropy During Movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Brain entropy (BEN) measures the irregularity or unpredictability of brain activity. Our previous studies have showcased the neurocorrelates and disease sensitivity of regional BEN. Task performance and neuromodulations as well as medications can modulate regional BEN. Movie-watching engages multiple-domain cognitions and complex brain activities mimicking the complex real world and has been increasingly used to probe brain state dynamics. The sustained multiple-domain cognitive activities would cause sustained changes to regional BEN, which however remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to address this gap. We first aimed to examine whether the fMRI-derived regional BEN represents a stable brain activity index during repeated measurement with or without movie-watching. We then assessed the movie-watching-induced regional BEN changes compared to resting state and regional BEN differences between different movie clips. we found higher reliability during movie-watching and movie-watching induced lower BEN in the sensory cortex and higher BEN in the association cortex compared to the resting state. We replicated and validated all findings in test-retest clips. This work systematically evaluated the regional BEN during movie-watching, providing a new direction for exploring brain activity under natural paradigms using BEN.

">Leveraging the transient statistics of quantal content to infer neuronal synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Quantal parameters of synapses are fundamental for the temporal dynamics of neurotransmitter release, forming the basis of interneuronal communication. We propose a class of models that capture the stochastic dynamics of quantal content (QC) - the number of SV fusion events per action potential (AP). Considering the probabilistic and time-varying nature of SV docking, undocking, and AP-triggered fusion, we derive an exact statistical distribution for the QC over time. Analyzing this distribution at steady-state and its associated autocorrelation function, we show that QC fluctuation statistics can be leveraged for inferring key presynaptic parameters, such as the probability of SV fusion (release probability), and SV replenishment at empty docking sites (refilling probability). Our model predictions are tested with electrophysiological data obtained from 50-Hz stimulation of auditory MNTB-LSO synapses in brainstem slices of juvenile mice. Our results show that while synaptic depression can be explained by low and constant refilling/release probabilities, this scenario is inconsistent with the statistics of the electrophysiological data that show a low QC Fano factor and almost uncorrelated successive QCs. Our systematic analysis yields a model that couples a high release probability to a time-varying refilling probability to explain both the synaptic depression and its associated statistical fluctuations. In summary, we provide a general approach that exploits stochastic signatures in QCs to infer neurotransmission-regulating processes that are indistinguishable from just analyzing averaged synaptic responses.

">Sequential emergence and contraction of epithelial subtypes in the prenatal human choroid plexus revealed by a stem cell model</a></h4>

              
                Despite the major roles of choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) in brain homeostasis and repair, their developmental lineage and diversity remain undefined. In simplified differentiations from human pluripotent stem cells, derived CPECs (dCPECs) displayed canonical properties and dynamic multiciliated phenotypes that interacted with A{beta} uptake. Single dCPEC transcriptomes over time correlated well with human organoid and fetal CPECs, while pseudotemporal and cell cycle analyses highlighted the direct CPEC origin from neuroepithelial cells. In addition, time series analyses defined metabolic (type 1) and ciliogenic dCPECs (type 2) at early timepoints, followed by type 1 diversification into anabolic-secretory (type 1a) and catabolic-absorptive subtypes (type 1b) as type 2 cells contracted. These temporal patterns were then confirmed in independent derivations and mapped to prenatal stages using human tissues. In addition to defining the prenatal lineage of human CPECs, these findings suggest new dynamic models of ChP support for the developing human brain.

">Studying time-resolved functional connectivity via communication theory: on the complementary nature of phase synchronization and sliding window Pearson correlation.</a></h4>

              
                Time-resolved functional connectivity (trFC) assesses the time-resolved coupling between brain regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. This study aims to compare two techniques used to estimate trFC, to investigate their similarities and differences when applied to fMRI data. These techniques are the sliding window Pearson correlation (SWPC), an amplitude-based approach, and phase synchronization (PS), a phase-based technique. To accomplish our objective, we used resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) with 827 subjects (repetition time: 0.7s) and the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (fBIRN) with 311 subjects (repetition time: 2s), which included 151 schizophrenia patients and 160 controls. Our simulations reveal distinct strengths in two connectivity methods: SWPC captures high-magnitude, low-frequency connectivity, while PS detects low-magnitude, high-frequency connectivity. Stronger correlations between SWPC and PS align with pronounced fMRI oscillations. For fMRI data, higher correlations between SWPC and PS occur with matched frequencies and smaller SWPC window sizes (~30s), but larger windows (~88s) sacrifice clinically relevant information. Both methods identify a schizophrenia-associated brain network state but show different patterns: SWPC highlights low anti-correlations between visual, subcortical, auditory, and sensory-motor networks, while PS shows reduced positive synchronization among these networks. Our findings underscore the complementary nature of SWPC and PS, elucidating their respective strengths and limitations without implying the superiority of one over the other.

">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Causally Supports Meta-Learning</a></h4>

              
                In dynamic environments with volatile rewards the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is believed to determine whether a visual object is relevant and should be chosen. The ACC may achieve this by integrating reward information over time to estimate which objects are worth to explore and which objects should be avoided. Such a higher-order meta-awareness about which objects should be explored predicts that the ACC causally contributes to choices when the reward values of objects are unknown and must be inferred from ongoing exploration. We tested this suggestion in nonhuman primates using a learning task that varied the number of object features that could be relevant, and by controlling the motivational value of choosing objects. During learning the ACC was transiently micro-stimulated when subjects foveated the to-be-chosen stimulus. We found that stimulation selectively impaired learning when feature uncertainty and motivational value of choices were high, which was linked to a deficit in using reward outcomes for feature-specific credit assignment. Application of an adaptive reinforcement learning model confirmed a primary deficit in weighting prediction errors that led to a meta-learning impairment to adaptively increase exploration during learning and to an impaired use of working memory to support learning. These findings provide causal evidence that the reward history traces in ACC are essential for meta-adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance and the strength of working memory of object values during adaptive behavior.

">GABAB receptors mediate intracellular calcium release in astrocytes of the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a cortical brain region whose multifaceted functions are based on a complex interplay between excitatory pyramidal neurons, inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and astrocytes maintaining a fine tuned excitation/inhibition balance (E/I balance). The regulation of the E/I balance in cortical network is crucial as the disruption leads to impairments in PFC associated behavior and pathologies. Astrocytes express specific GABA receptors that mediate intracellular Ca2+ signaling upon stimulation by GABA, resulting in the release of gliotransmitters directly impacting information processing. However, the signaling pathway leading to GABA-induced Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes of the PFC is not well understood. Here we took advantage of GLAST promoter driven GCaMP6s expression in astrocytes to study GABAergic Ca2+ signaling in PFC astrocytes by confocal microscopy. The results show that GABA induces Ca2+ signaling via the stimulation of the metabotropic GABAB receptor in astrocytes. GABAB receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals greatly depend on intracellular Ca2+ stores rather than on extracellular Ca2+. Additionally, antagonists of the PLC/IP3-signaling cascade significantly reduced GABAB receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, suggesting that astrocytic GABAB receptors in the PFC are coupled to the Gq-GPCR signaling pathway.

">DySCo: a general framework for dynamic Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                A crucial challenge in neuroscience involves characterising brain dynamics from high-dimensional brain recordings. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical framework, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications. With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows: 1) A new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. 2) The introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information. 3) To simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.

                In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained for naturalistic emotional stimuli to examine the consistency of neural responses among participants in specific regions related to valence. We reanalyzed fMRI data from 17 participants as they watched episodes of "Sherlock" and used emotional ratings from 125 participants. To determine regions where neural response patterns were synchronized across participants based on the pattern of valence changes, intersubject correlation analysis was conducted. As a validation analysis, multidimensional scaling was conducted to investigate emotional representation for significant regions of interest. The results revealed that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral superior frontal cortices, left posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral inferior frontal cortices showed increased neural synchrony as positive scenes were presented. Also, the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and bilateral medial temporal gyrus exhibited increased neural synchrony as negative scenes were presented. Moreover, the left inferior frontal cortex and right superior frontal gyrus were found to be engaged in emotion representation and display increased neural synchrony. These findings provide insights into the differential neural responses to emotionally evocative naturalistic stimuli as compared to conventional experimental stimuli. Also, this study highlights the future potential for using intersubject correlation analysis for examining consistency of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli.

                Digital therapeutics, enabled by advanced machine learning algorithms and medical wearable devices, offer a promising approach to streamline diagnostics and improve access to healthcare. Within this framework, automatic sleep scoring can provide accurate and efficient sleep analysis from electrophysiological signals recorded with wearable sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG). However, the optimal configuration and temporal dynamics of automatic sleep scoring systems remain unclear, especially concerning their performance across different population samples. This study systematically investigates the impact of electrode setup, temporal scope, and population characteristics on the performance of automatic sleep scoring algorithms. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we analyzed various electrode configurations and temporal dynamics using datasets comprising both healthy participants and individuals with sleep apnea. Our findings reveal that sleep scoring based on a single frontal EEG channel demonstrates reliable congruency with human expert scorers, with minimal improvement observed with additional sensors. Moreover, we demonstrate that real-time sleep scoring can be achieved with comparable accuracy to offline methods, which rely on past and future information to classify a window of interest. Remarkably, a notable reduction in decoding accuracy is observed for individuals with sleep disorders compared to healthy participants, highlighting the challenges inherent in accurately assessing sleep stages in clinical populations. Digital solutions for automatic sleep scoring hold promise for facilitating timely diagnoses and personalized treatment plans, with applications extending beyond sleep analysis to include closed-loop neurostimulation interventions. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complexities of automatic sleep scoring and offer considerations for the development of effective and efficient sleep assessment tools in both clinical and research settings.

">An optimized method to visualize lipid droplets in brain tissue demonstrates their substantial accumulation in aged brains</a></h4>

              
                Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular stores for lipids. These organelles have recently gained interest in neuroscience because they accumulate in various cell types in neurodegenerative diseases. However, their role under physiological conditions is still not fully understood. Classical LD staining methods, which use lipophilic dyes like BODIPY 493/503 (BD493) or antibodies against LD coat proteins, show very few LDs in healthy brain tissue. Our recently developed novel endogenous LD reporter mouse challenges this view. We have been able to detect numerous LDs in healthy brain tissue from both adult and developing mice without staining. To understand why classical staining and endogenous labeling yield different results, we thoroughly investigated the effects of tissue preparation and detergent used in LD detection. We found that BD493 works poorly in brain tissue, while other lipophilic dyes visualize many LDs. We also found that antibody-based LD detection depends on tissue pretreatment and detergent concentration but can reveal a similar number of LDs as observed with the endogenous LD reporter mouse. Taken together, we here present an optimized procedure for LD detection in brain tissue using commercially available dyes and antibodies. Using these methods, we demonstrate that LDs are numerous in healthy brain tissue and substantially accumulate in aged brains in various cell types, including neurons.

">Contribution of neurons that express fruitless and Clock transcription factors to behavioral rhythms and courtship</a></h4>

              
                Animals need to integrate information across neuronal networks that direct reproductive behaviors and circadian rhythms. In Drosophila, the master regulatory transcription factors that direct courtship behaviors and circadian rhythms are co-expressed in a small set of neurons. In this study we investigate the role of these neurons in both males and females. We find sex-differences in the number of these fruitless and Clock -expressing neurons (fru {Omega} Clk neurons) that is regulated by male-specific Fru. We assign the fru {Omega} Clk neurons to the electron microscopy connectome that provides high resolution structural information. We also discover sex-differences in the number of fru-expressing neurons that are post-synaptic targets of Clk-expressing neurons, with more post-synaptic targets in males. When fru {Omega} Clk neurons are activated or silenced, males have a shorter period length. Activation of fru {Omega} Clk neurons also changes the rate a courtship behavior is performed. We find that activation and silencing fru {Omega} Clk neurons impacts the molecular clock in the sLNv master pacemaker neurons, in a cell-nonautonomous manner. These results reveal how neurons that subserve the two processes, reproduction and circadian rhythms, can impact behavioral outcomes in a sex-specific manner.

">A NEW POSTURAL MOTOR RESPONSE TO SPINAL CORD STIMULATION: POST-STIMULATION REBOUND EXTENSION</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a therapeutic tool for improving motor function following spinal cord injury. While many studies focus on restoring locomotion, little attention is paid to enabling standing which is a prerequisite of walking. In this study, we fully characterize a new type of response to SCS, a long extension activated post-stimulation (LEAP). LEAP is primarily directed to ankle extensors and hence has great clinical potential to assist postural movements. To characterize this new response, we used the decerebrate cat model to avoid the suppressive effects of anesthesia, and combined EMG and force measurement in the hindlimb with intracellular recordings in the lumbar spinal cord. Stimulation was delivered as five-second trains via bipolar electrodes placed on the cord surface, and multiple combinations of stimulation locations (L4 to S2), amplitudes (50-600 uA), and frequencies (10-40 Hz) were tested. While the optimum stimulation location and frequency differed slightly among animals, the stimulation amplitude was key for controlling LEAP duration and amplitude. To study the mechanism of LEAP, we performed in vivo intracellular recordings of motoneurons. In 70% of motoneurons, LEAP increased at hyperpolarized membrane potentials indicating a synaptic origin. Furthermore, spinal interneurons exhibited changes in firing during LEAP, confirming the circuit origin of this behavior. Finally, to identify the type of afferents involved in generating LEAP, we used shorter stimulation pulses (more selective for proprioceptive afferents), as well as peripheral stimulation of the sural nerve (cutaneous afferents). The data indicates that LEAP primarily relies on proprioceptive afferents and has major differences from pain or withdrawal reflexes mediated by cutaneous afferents. Our study has thus identified and characterized a novel postural motor response to SCS which has the potential to expand the applications of SCS for patients with motor disorders.

	<p>Rotenone (RTN) induces neurotoxicity and motor dysfunction in rats, mirroring the pathophysiological traits of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), including striatal oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in neural structure. This makes RTN a valuable model for PD research. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid recognized for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, was evaluated for its ability to counteract RTN-induced impairments. Rats received subcutaneous RTN at 0.5 mg/kg for 21 days, resulting in weight loss and significant motor deficits assessed through open-field, bar catalepsy, beam-crossing, rotarod, and grip strength tests. BBR, administered orally at 30 or 100 mg/kg doses, one hour prior to RTN exposure for the same duration, effectively mitigated many of the RTN-induced motor impairments. Furthermore, BBR treatment reduced RTN-induced nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, bolstered antioxidative capacity, enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activities (e.g., succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), ATPase, and the electron transport chain (ETC)), and diminished striatal neuroinflammation and apoptosis markers. Notably, the co-administration of trigonelline (TGN), an inhibitor of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, significantly attenuated BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s protective effects, indicating that BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective actions are mediated via the Nrf2 pathway. These results underscore BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential in ameliorating motor impairments akin to PD, suggesting its promise in potentially delaying or managing PD symptoms. Further research is warranted to translate these preclinical findings into clinical settings, enhancing our comprehension of BBR&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic prospects in PD.</p>

                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep is thought to facilitate memory consolidation. Most sleep reactivation research has examined how reactivation of specific facts, objects, and associations benefits their overall retention. However, our memories are not unitary, and not all features of a memory persist in tandem over time. Instead, our memories are transformed, with some features strengthened and others weakened. Does sleep reactivation drive memory transformation? We leveraged the Targeted Memory Reactivation technique in an object category learning paradigm to examine this question. Participants (20 female, 14 male) learned three categories of novel objects, where each object had unique, distinguishing features as well as features shared with other members of its category. We used a real-time EEG protocol to cue the reactivation of these objects during sleep at moments optimized to generate reactivation events. We found that reactivation improved memory for distinguishing features while worsening memory for shared features, suggesting a differentiation process. The results indicate that sleep reactivation does not act holistically on object memories, instead supporting a transformation where some features are enhanced over others.</p>

                <p>In 1998, Jones suggested a classification of thalamocortical projections into core and matrix divisions (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B18">Jones, 1998</cross-ref>). In this classification, core projections are specific, topographical, innervate middle cortical layers, and serve to transmit specific information to the cortex for further analysis; matrix projections, in contrast, are diffuse, much less topographic, innervate upper layers, especially Layer 1, and serve a more global, modulatory function, such as affecting levels of arousal. This classification has proven especially influential in studies of thalamocortical relationships. Whereas it may be the case that a clear subset of thalamocortical connections fit the core motif, since they are specific, topographic, and innervate middle layers, we argue that there is no clear evidence for any single class that encompasses the remainder of thalamocortical connections as is claimed for matrix. Instead, there is great morphological variation in connections made by thalamocortical projections fitting neither a core nor matrix classification. We thus conclude that the core/matrix classification should be abandoned, because its application is not helpful in providing insights into thalamocortical interactions and can even be misleading. As one example of the latter, recent suggestions indicate that core projections are equivalent to first-order thalamic relays (i.e., those that relay subcortical information to the cortex) and matrix to higher-order relays (i.e., those that relay information from one cortical area to another), but available evidence does not support this relationship. All of this points to a need to replace the core/matrix grouping with a more complete classification of thalamocortical projections.</p>

                <p>General anesthetics disrupt brain network dynamics through multiple pathways, in part through postsynaptic potentiation of inhibitory ion channels as well as presynaptic inhibition of neuroexocytosis. Common clinical general anesthetic drugs, such as propofol and isoflurane, have been shown to interact and interfere with core components of the exocytic release machinery to cause impaired neurotransmitter release. Recent studies however suggest that these drugs do not affect all synapse subtypes equally. We investigated the role of the presynaptic release machinery in multiple neurotransmitter systems under isoflurane general anesthesia in the adult female <I>Drosophila</I> brain using live-cell super&ndash;resolution microscopy and optogenetic readouts of exocytosis and neural excitability. We activated neurotransmitter-specific mushroom body output neurons and imaged presynaptic function under isoflurane anesthesia. We found that isoflurane impaired synaptic release and presynaptic protein dynamics in excitatory cholinergic synapses. In contrast, isoflurane had little to no effect on inhibitory GABAergic or glutamatergic synapses. These results present a distinct inhibitory mechanism for general anesthesia, whereby neuroexocytosis is selectively impaired at excitatory synapses, while inhibitory synapses remain functional. This suggests a presynaptic inhibitory mechanism that complements the other inhibitory effects of these drugs.</p>

                <p>Acetylcholine is a robust neuromodulator of the limbic system and a critical regulator of arousal and emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala (AMY) are key limbic structures that are both densely innervated by cholinergic afferents and interact with each other for emotional regulation. The ACC is composed of functionally distinct dorsal (A24), rostral (A32), and ventral (A25) areas that differ in their connections with the AMY. The structural substrates of cholinergic modulation of distinct ACC microcircuits and outputs to AMY are thought to depend on the laminar and subcellular localization of cholinergic receptors. The present study examines the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, m1 and m2, on distinct excitatory and inhibitory neurons and on AMY-targeting projection neurons within ACC areas, via immunohistochemistry and injections of neural tracers into the basolateral AMY in adult rhesus monkeys of both sexes. We found that laminar densities of m1+ and m2+ expressing excitatory and inhibitory neurons depended on area and cell type. Among the ACC areas, ventral subgenual ACC A25 exhibited greater m2+ localization on presynaptic inhibitory axon terminals and greater density of m1+ and m2+ expressing AMY-targeting (tracer+) pyramidal neurons. These patterns suggest robust cholinergic disinhibition and potentiation of amygdalar outputs from the limbic ventral ACC, which may be linked to the hyperexcitability of this subgenual ACC area in depression. These findings reveal the anatomical substrate of diverse cholinergic modulation of specific ACC microcircuits and amygdalar outputs that mediate cognitive&ndash;emotional integration and dysfunctions underlying stress and affective disorders.</p>

                <p>Understanding the function of the human brain requires determining basic properties of synaptic transmission in human neurons. One of the most fundamental parameters controlling neurotransmitter release is the presynaptic action potential, but its amplitude and duration remain controversial. Presynaptic action potentials have so far been measured with high temporal resolution only in a limited number of vertebrate but not in human neurons. To uncover properties of human presynaptic action potentials, we exploited recently developed tools to generate human glutamatergic neurons by transient expression of Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) in pluripotent stem cells. During maturation for 3 to 9&nbsp;weeks of culturing in different established media, the proportion of cells with multiple axon initial segments decreased, while the amount of axonal tau protein and neuronal excitability increased. Super-resolution microscopy revealed the alignment of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins, Bassoon and Homer. Synaptic transmission was surprisingly reliable at frequencies of 20, 50, and 100&nbsp;Hz. The synchronicity of synaptic transmission during high-frequency transmission increased during 9&nbsp;weeks of neuronal maturation. To analyze the mechanisms of synchronous high-frequency glutamate release, we developed direct presynaptic patch-clamp recordings from human neurons. The presynaptic action potentials had large overshoots to ~25&nbsp;mV and short durations of ~0.5&nbsp;ms. Our findings show that Ngn2-induced neurons represent an elegant model system allowing for functional, structural, and molecular analyses of glutamatergic synaptic transmission with high spatiotemporal resolution in human neurons. Furthermore, our data predict that glutamatergic transmission is mediated by large and rapid presynaptic action potentials in the human brain.</p>

                <p>Structural differences along the hippocampal long axis are believed to underlie meaningful functional differences. Yet, recent data-driven parcellations of the hippocampus subdivide the hippocampus into a 10-cluster map with anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral, middle, and posterior components. We tested whether task and experience could modulate this clustering using a spatial learning experiment where male and female participants were trained to virtually navigate a novel neighborhood in a Google Street View-like environment. Participants were scanned while navigating routes early in training and after a 2&nbsp;week training period. Using the 10-cluster map as the ideal template, we found that participants who eventually learn the neighborhood well have hippocampal cluster maps consistent with the ideal&mdash;even on their second day of learning&mdash;and their cluster mappings do not deviate over the 2&nbsp;week training period. However, participants who eventually learn the neighborhood poorly begin with hippocampal cluster maps inconsistent with the ideal template, though their cluster mappings may become more stereotypical after the 2&nbsp;week training. Interestingly this improvement seems to be route specific: after some early improvement, when a new route is navigated, participants' hippocampal maps revert back to less stereotypical organization. We conclude that hippocampal clustering is not dependent solely on anatomical structure and instead is driven by a combination of anatomy, task, and, importantly, experience. Nonetheless, while hippocampal clustering can change with experience, efficient navigation depends on functional hippocampal activity clustering in a stereotypical manner, highlighting optimal divisions of processing along the hippocampal anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes.</p>

                <p>Despite the known behavioral benefits of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, discrete neural oscillatory events in human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) linked with behavior have not been discovered. This knowledge gap hinders mechanistic understanding of the function of sleep, as well as the development of biophysical models and REM-based causal interventions. We designed a detection algorithm to identify bursts of activity in high-density, scalp EEG within theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) and alpha (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) bands during REM sleep. Across 38 nights of sleep, we characterized the burst events (i.e., count, duration, density, peak frequency, amplitude) in healthy, young male and female human participants (38; 21F) and investigated burst activity in relation to sleep-dependent memory tasks: hippocampal-dependent episodic verbal memory and nonhippocampal visual perceptual learning. We found greater burst count during the more REM-intensive second half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), longer burst duration during the first half of the night (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05), but no differences across the night in density or power (<I>p</I> &gt; 0.05). Moreover, increased alpha burst power was associated with increased overnight forgetting for episodic memory (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we show that increased REM theta burst activity in retinotopically specific regions was associated with better visual perceptual performance. Our work provides a critical bridge between discrete REM sleep events in human scalp EEG that support cognitive processes and the identification of similar activity patterns in animal models that allow for further mechanistic characterization.</p>

                <p>Genetic variants in the <I>apolipoprotein E</I> (<I>APOE</I>) gene affect the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The <I>APOE</I> Christchurch (<I>APOE</I> Ch) variant has been identified as the most prominent candidate for preventing the onset and progression of AD. In this study, we generated isogenic <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> healthy control female iPSCs and induced them into astrocytes. RNA expression analysis revealed the inherent resilience of <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes to induce a reactive state in response to inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cytokine treatment changed astrocytic morphology with more complexity in <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes, but not in <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes, indicating resilience of the rare variant to a reactive state. Interestingly, we observed robust morphological alterations containing more intricate processes when cocultured with iPSC-derived cortical neurons, in which <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes reduced complexity compared with <I>APOE3</I>/<I>3</I> astrocytes. To assess the impacts of tau propagation effects, we next developed a sophisticated and sensitive assay utilizing cortical neurons derived from human iPSCs, previously generated from donors of both sexes. We showed that <I>APOE3</I>Ch/<I>3</I>Ch astrocytes effectively mitigated tau propagation within iPSC-derived neurons. This study provides important experimental evidence of the characteristic functions exhibited by <I>APOE3Ch/3Ch</I> astrocytes, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of novel clinical interventions in AD research.</p>

                <p>Faces and bodies are processed in separate but adjacent regions in the primate visual cortex. Yet, the functional significance of dividing the whole person into areas dedicated to its face and body components and their neighboring locations remains unknown. Here we hypothesized that this separation and proximity together with a normalization mechanism generate clutter-tolerant representations of the face, body, and whole person when presented in complex multi-category scenes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a fMRI study, presenting images of a person within a multi-category scene to human male and female participants and assessed the contribution of each component to the response to the scene. Our results revealed a clutter-tolerant representation of the whole person in areas selective for both faces and bodies, typically located at the border between the two category-selective regions. Regions exclusively selective for faces or bodies demonstrated clutter-tolerant representations of their preferred category, corroborating earlier findings. Thus, the adjacent locations of face- and body-selective areas enable a hardwired machinery for decluttering of the whole person, without the need for a dedicated population of person-selective neurons. This distinct yet proximal functional organization of category-selective brain regions enhances the representation of the socially significant whole person, along with its face and body components, within multi-category scenes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/24/e1873232024?rss=1">Computational Mechanisms Underlying Motivation to Earn Symbolic Reinforcers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reinforcement learning is a theoretical framework that describes how agents learn to select options that maximize rewards and minimize punishments over time. We often make choices, however, to obtain symbolic reinforcers (e.g., money, points) that are later exchanged for primary reinforcers (e.g., food, drink). Although symbolic reinforcers are ubiquitous in our daily lives, widely used in laboratory tasks because they can be motivating, mechanisms by which they become motivating are less understood. In the present study, we examined how monkeys learn to make choices that maximize fluid rewards through reinforcement with tokens. The question addressed here is how the value of a state, which is a function of multiple task features (e.g., the current number of accumulated tokens, choice options, task epoch, trials since the last delivery of primary reinforcer, etc.), drives value and affects motivation. We constructed a Markov decision process model that computes the value of task states given task features to then correlate with the motivational state of the animal. Fixation times, choice reaction times, and abort frequency were all significantly related to values of task states during the tokens task (<I>n</I> = 5 monkeys, three males and two females). Furthermore, the model makes predictions for how neural responses could change on a moment-by-moment basis relative to changes in the state value. Together, this task and model allow us to capture learning and behavior related to symbolic reinforcement.</p>

                <p>The 40&nbsp;Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an oscillatory brain response to periodically modulated auditory stimuli, is a promising, noninvasive physiological biomarker for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. The 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR might be amplified by synaptic interactions in cortical circuits, which are, in turn, disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we tested whether the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the human auditory cortex depends on two key synaptic components of neuronal interactions within cortical circuits: excitation via N-methyl-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptors and inhibition via gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) receptors. We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings with placebo-controlled, low-dose pharmacological interventions in the same healthy human participants (13 males, 7 females). All participants exhibited a robust 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in auditory cortices, especially in the right hemisphere, under a placebo. The GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor&ndash;agonist lorazepam increased the amplitude of the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR, while no effect was detectable under the NMDA blocker memantine. Our findings indicate that the 40&nbsp;Hz ASSR in the auditory cortex involves synaptic (and likely intracortical) inhibition via the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor, thus highlighting its utility as a mechanistic signature of cortical circuit dysfunctions involving GABAergic inhibition.</p>

                <p>Visual crowding refers to the phenomenon where a target object that is easily identifiable in isolation becomes difficult to recognize when surrounded by other stimuli (distractors). Many psychophysical studies have investigated this phenomenon and proposed alternative models for the underlying mechanisms. One prominent hypothesis, albeit with mixed psychophysical support, posits that crowding arises from the loss of information due to pooled encoding of features from target and distractor stimuli in the early stages of cortical visual processing. However, neurophysiological studies have not rigorously tested this hypothesis. We studied the responses of single neurons in macaque (one male, one female) area V4, an intermediate stage of the object-processing pathway, to parametrically designed crowded displays and texture statistics-matched metameric counterparts. Our investigations reveal striking parallels between how crowding parameters&mdash;number, distance, and position of distractors&mdash;influence human psychophysical performance and V4 shape selectivity. Importantly, we also found that enhancing the salience of a target stimulus could alleviate crowding effects in highly cluttered scenes, and this could be temporally protracted reflecting a dynamical process. Thus, a pooled encoding of nearby stimuli cannot explain the observed responses, and we propose an alternative model where V4 neurons preferentially encode salient stimuli in crowded displays. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude of crowding effects is determined not just by the number of distractors and target&ndash;distractor separation but also by the relative salience of targets versus distractors based on their feature attributes&mdash;the similarity of distractors and the contrast between target and distractor stimuli.</p>

                <p>Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is an inducible NADase that localizes to mitochondria throughout neurons and senses metabolic changes that occur after injury. Minimal proteomic changes are observed upon either SARM1 depletion or activation, suggesting that SARM1 does not exert broad effects on neuronal protein homeostasis. However, whether SARM1 activation occurs throughout the neuron in response to injury and cell stress remains largely unknown. Using a semiautomated imaging pipeline and a custom-built deep learning scoring algorithm, we studied degeneration in both mixed-sex mouse primary cortical neurons and male human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons in response to a number of different stressors. We show that SARM1 activation is differentially restricted to specific neuronal compartments depending on the stressor. Cortical neurons undergo SARM1-dependent axon degeneration after mechanical transection, and SARM1 activation is limited to the axonal compartment distal to the injury site. However, global SARM1 activation following vacor treatment causes both cell body and axon degeneration. Context-specific stressors, such as microtubule dysfunction and mitochondrial stress, induce axonal SARM1 activation leading to SARM1-dependent axon degeneration and SARM1-independent cell body death. Our data reveal that compartment-specific SARM1&ndash;mediated death signaling is dependent on the type of injury and cellular stressor.</p>

                Background The spirochaete Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, which causes the infectious disease syphilis, can be spread through sexual contact or perinatal transmission. In recent years, cases of syphilis have increased, especially among individuals engaging in behaviour that makes them more vulnerable (condomless sex and multiple sexual partners). Condylomata acuminata (external genital warts) is one of the most common viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Individuals who are behaviourally vulnerable are also highly prone to two or more STIs. Our case exemplifies the occurrence of two STIs in a young man who was behaviourally vulnerable to acquiring STIs. Case We report a case of a 21-year-old year old heterosexual man presenting with concomitant primary syphilis and genital warts. He presented with a painless genital ulcer and warty growths on his glans penis. Examination showed a painless indurated ulcer and multiple genital warts. Serology was positive for quantitative Venereal disease research laboratory test (1:16 titre). The patient was diagnosed with two concomitant STIs. He was treated as per the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for primary syphilis and podophyllin resin for genital warts. After four weeks, the genital ulcer showed complete healing and there was a significant reduction of genital warts. Conclusions Individuals with multiple sexual partners engaging in sexual activity without the use of prevention tools are at a greater chance of acquiring two or more STIs. To reduce concomitant transmission, preventive measures against genital ulcer diseases like syphilis, herpes, and chancroid, such as early identification and treatment, and condom distribution, must be strengthened as part of national STI prevention. Patients with two or more STIs should be followed regularly to assess the progress of infection and should be offered timely medical treatment.

                Background Tumor budding is defined as a single cell or a cluster of up to five tumor cells at the invasion front of all oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases. Tumor budding is considered as a marker of many important events in oral carcinoma, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and for further prognosis. Methods A total of 30 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed cases of OSCC were retrieved from the archival of the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology. After assessing the sections for the presence of tumor budding (TB), it is further categorized into high-intensity TB and low-intensity TB. Results We found a strong association between lymph node metastasis and histopathological grading in the current study. There was no association between TB and a patient’s survival rate. Conclusions This study emphasizes the significance of tumor budding, its relevance to prognosis, and reproducibility, as well as the significance of its evaluation and incorporation into routine surgical pathology practice in the management of OSCC. As a result, we believe that tumor budding is a crucial factor in determining tumor behavior.

                Objective This study aimed to establish the factor structure and reliability of the evaluation instrument measuring monkeypox (Mpox) knowledge, perception and beliefs of health threat in students of the health area in two universities of Peru during 2022. Methods The methodology used was psychometric in nature. The study variable on knowledge of monkeypox was based on the instrument made by Ricco et al., carried out with health professionals, adjusted to Peru and administered to 416 students. Results The results showed adequate goodness-of-fit indicators with RMSEA and SRMR coefficients lower than 0.08 and a TLI lower than 0.90 and adequate reliability values for knowledge of monkeypox (KR20=0.70 and α=0.73), with the perception of health threats being the one with the highest reliability (α=0.88 and Ω=0.89). Conclusions Having instruments that accurately reflect the knowledge, perception and beliefs of health students will make it possible to contribute significantly to the prevention, control and management of this disease and, at the same time, be prepared to address other challenges of public health in the future.

                Sebaceous carcinoma is an extremely rare malignant disease and it is more aggressive when it occurs in the eyelids and orbit. It can mimic several benign lesions, resulting in diagnostic delay. We present a case of sebaceous carcinoma in a 50-year-old male who presented with complaints of swelling of the upper eyelid, which was followed by appearance of an ulcerative growth over the eyelid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports showed an ulcerated mass in the left periorbital and orbital region appearing heterogeneously hyperintense. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed malignant epithelial differentiation which was followed by exenteration of the eyeball. Histopathology showed the rare diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The disease has a poor prognosis as the entity is associated with increased morbidity and if not detected early it can metastasize to other organs which may be fatal sometimes.

                Background Antimalarial drug resistance is a major challenge hampering malaria control and elimination. About three-quarters of Eritrea’s population resides in the malaria-endemic western lowlands of the country. Plasmodium falciparum, the leading causative parasite species, has developed resistance to basically all antimalarials. Continued surveillance of drug resistance using genetic markers provides important molecular data for treatment policies which complements clinical studies, and strengthens control efforts. This study sought to genotype point mutations associated with P. falciparum resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin, in dried-blood spots from three hospitals in the western lowlands of Eritrea. Methods Dried-blood spot samples were collected from patients visiting Adi Quala, Keren and Gash Barka Hospitals, between July and October, 2014. The patients were followed up after treatment with first line artesunate-amodiaquine, and dried-blood spots were collected on day three after treatment. Nested polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing techniques were employed to genotype point mutations in the Pfdhfr (PF3D7_0417200), Pfdhps (PF3D7_0810800) and PfK13 (PF3D7_1343700) partial gene regions. Results Sequence data analyses of PCR-positive isolates found wild-type artemisinin haplotypes associated with resistance (Y493Y, R539R, I543I) in three isolates, whereas four mutant antifolate haplotypes associated with resistance were observed in six isolates. These included the triple-mutant Pfdhfr (S108N, C59R, N51I) haplotype, the double-mutant Pfdhfr (N51I, S108N) haplotype, the single-mutant Pfdhfr (K540E) haplotype, and the mixed-mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps (S108N, N51I + K540E) haplotype. Other findings observed were, a rare non-synonymous Pfdhfr V45A mutation in four isolates, and a synonymous Pfdhps R449R in one isolate. Conclusions The mutant antifolate haplotypes observed indicate a likely existence of full SP resistance. Further studies can be carried out to estimate the prevalence of SP resistance. The wild-type artemisinin haplotypes observed suggest artemisinin is still an effective treatment. Continuous monitoring of point mutations associated with delayed parasite clearance in ART clinical studies is recommended.

                Background The Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) poses a significant challenge in sports medicine due to its multifactorial etiology involving both physiological and psychological factors. Though widely used, conventional physiotherapy approaches often yield limited efficacy and high recurrence rates. Mindfulness-based interventions have emerged as promising adjuncts in managing various musculoskeletal conditions, offering potential benefits in pain management, coping strategies, and overall well-being. However, their efficacy in addressing PFPS remains underexplored, particularly in the context of recreational long-distance runners. This study investigates the effects of integrating mindfulness training as an adjunct to conventional physiotherapy on pain intensity, functional outcomes, and mindfulness awareness in recreational long-distance runners with PFPS. Methods Eligible individuals will be assigned randomly to either Group A (Mindfulness Training + Conventional Physiotherapy) or Group B (Conventional Physiotherapy). Outcome measures, such as the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and knee joint position sense using a goniometer will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Mindfulness training will encompass a variety of techniques integrated with conventional physiotherapy sessions. Result This study has the potential to offer an enhanced treatment strategy that considers both the physical and psychological aspects of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS), potentially improving outcomes and well-being for recreational long-distance runners.

                Background As there is high expense of treatment and potential long-term consequences including chronic ankle instability (CAI), lateral ankle sprains (LAS) are common among athletes and represent a substantial healthcare burden. In terms of preventing more injuries and encouraging a full recovery, traditional treatments frequently fall short. Methods At the Department of Sports Physiotherapy, futsal athletes with grade I and grade II lateral ankle sprains will participate in a parallel-group, 1:1 allocation ratio trial. Individuals who fulfil the eligibility requirements will be randomized at random to either the experimental or control group. Conventional physiotherapy treatments will be administered to the control group, and IVR sessions utilizing certain games will be administered to the experimental group in addition to the same therapies. The Y Balance Tool is used to measure dynamic balance, the X Sens MVN system is used to measure vertical jump, and the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is used to assess static balance. Result This study aims to offer a new way to improving results for futsal players recovering from lateral ankle sprains by utilizing IVR technology in conjunction with traditional physiotherapy. The results could lead to the creation of more efficient sports-related injury rehabilitation programs, which would improve athlete performance and lessen the incidence of ankle sprains in athletic populations.

                Background Due to occupational exposure, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) infection than the general population. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) may increase the risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs, potentially reducing the available health workforce. We examined the association between NCDs and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality among infected HCWs. Methods This cohort study used data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) database. HCWs hospitalized between January 2020 and January 2023 due to clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Variables collected included demographic data, comorbidities, and hospitalization outcomes. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean/standard deviation (SD), median/interquartile range (IQR), or frequencies and proportions. For each NCD, the relative risk of death, adjusted for age and sex, was calculated using log-binomial regression as well as the population-attributable fraction. Results There were 17,502 HCWs, 95.7% of whom had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The majority were female (66.5%) and the mean age (SD) was 49.8 (14.3) years. Roughly, half (51.42%) of HCWs had no comorbidities, 29.28% had one comorbidity, 14.68% had 2 comorbidities and <5% had ≥3 comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (49.40%) and cardiovascular disease (36.90%). Approximately one-fifth of the HCWs had severe COVID-19 (16.95%) and 10.68% of the HCWs with COVID-19 died. Being ≥45 years old, male gender, smoking, obesity, and certain NCDs increased the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Obesity and diabetes mellitus were the leading risk factors in terms of the population-attributable risk for COVID-19 severity (6.89%) and mortality (36.00%) respectively. Conclusions Many HCWs with COVID-19 had one or more NCDs. Obesity and diabetes mellitus increased COVID-19 severity and mortality risk. Reducing the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus would yield the biggest reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality among HCWs.

                <p>by Yu Zhu, Babak Momeni</p>

Host-associated resident microbiota can protect their host from pathogens—a community-level trait called colonization resistance. The effect of the diversity of the resident community in previous studies has shown contradictory results, with higher diversity either strengthening or weakening colonization resistance. To control the confounding factors that may lead to such contradictions, we use mathematical simulations with a focus on species interactions and their impact on colonization resistance. We use a mediator-explicit model that accounts for metabolite-mediated interactions to perform <i>in silico</i> invasion experiments. We show that the relationship between colonization resistance and species richness of the resident community is not monotonic because it depends on two underlying trends as the richness of the resident community increases: a decrease in instances of augmentation (invader species added, without driving out resident species) and an increase in instances of displacement (invader species added, driving out some of the resident species). These trends hold consistently under different parameters, regardless of the number of compounds that mediate interactions between species or the proportion of the facilitative versus inhibitory interactions among species. Our results show a positive correlation between resistance and diversity in low-richness communities and a negative correlation in high-richness communities, offering an explanation for the seemingly contradictory trend in the resistance-diversity relationship in previous reports.

Restrictions of cross-border mobility are typically used to prevent an emerging disease from entering a country in order to slow down its spread. However, such interventions can come with a significant societal cost and should thus be based on careful analysis and quantitative understanding on their effects. To this end, we model the influence of cross-border mobility on the spread of COVID-19 during 2020 in the neighbouring Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We investigate the immediate impact of cross-border travel on disease spread and employ counterfactual scenarios to explore the cumulative effects of introducing additional infected individuals into a population during the ongoing epidemic. Our results indicate that the effect of inter-country mobility on epidemic growth is non-negligible essentially when there is sizeable mobility from a high prevalence country or countries to a low prevalence one. Our findings underscore the critical importance of accurate data and models on both epidemic progression and travel patterns in informing decisions related to inter-country mobility restrictions.

                <p>by Jakob Jordan, João Sacramento, Willem A. M. Wybo, Mihai A. Petrovici, Walter Senn</p>

A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory, the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear. We propose a novel, Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity.

CRISPR-Cas12a, often regarded as a precise genome editor, still requires improvements in specificity. In this study, we used a GFP-activation assay to screen 14 new Cas12a nucleases for mammalian genome editing, successfully identifying 9 active ones. Notably, these Cas12a nucleases prefer pyrimidine-rich PAMs. Among these nucleases, we extensively characterized Mb4Cas12a obtained from <i>Moraxella bovis CCUG 2133</i>, which recognizes a YYN PAM (Y = C or T). Our biochemical analysis demonstrates that Mb4Cas12a can cleave double-strand DNA across a wide temperature range. To improve specificity, we constructed a SWISS-MODEL of Mb4Cas12a based on the FnCas12a crystal structure and identified 8 amino acids potentially forming hydrogen bonds at the target DNA-crRNA interface. By replacing these amino acids with alanine to disrupt the hydrogen bond, we tested the influence of each mutation on Mb4Cas12a specificity. Interestingly, the F370A mutation improved specificity with minimal influence on activity. Further study showed that Mb4Cas12a-F370A is capable of discriminating single-nucleotide polymorphisms. These new Cas12a orthologs and high-fidelity variants hold substantial promise for therapeutic applications.

                <p>by Yassine Cherrak, Miguel Angel Salazar, Koray Yilmaz, Markus Kreuzer, Wolf-Dietrich Hardt</p>

The gastrointestinal tract is densely colonized by a polymicrobial community known as the microbiota which serves as primary line of defence against pathogen invasion. The microbiota can limit gut-luminal pathogen growth at different stages of infection. This can be traced to specific commensal strains exhibiting direct or indirect protective functions. Although these mechanisms hold the potential to develop new approaches to combat enteric pathogens, they remain far from being completely described. In this study, we investigated how a mouse commensal <i>Escherichia coli</i> can outcompete <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>S</i>. Tm). Using a salmonellosis mouse model, we found that the commensal <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 strain relies on a trojan horse trap strategy to limit <i>S</i>. Tm expansion in the inflamed gut. Combining mutants and reporter tools, we demonstrated that inflammation triggers the expression of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 antimicrobial microcin H47 toxin which, when fused to salmochelin siderophores, can specifically alter <i>S</i>. Tm growth. This protective function was compromised upon disruption of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> 8178 <i>tonB</i>-dependent catecholate siderophore uptake system, highlighting a previously unappreciated crosstalk between iron intake and microcin H47 activity. By identifying the genetic determinants mediating <i>S</i>. Tm competition, our work not only provides a better mechanistic understanding of the protective function displayed by members of the gut microbiota but also further expands the general contribution of microcins in bacterial antagonistic relationships. Ultimately, such insights can open new avenues for developing microbiota-based approaches to better control intestinal infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95708">Role of N343 glycosylation on the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD structure and co-receptor binding across variants of concern</a></h4>

              
                Glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein represents a key target for viral evolution because it affects both viral evasion and fitness. Successful variations in the glycan shield are difficult to achieve though, as protein glycosylation is also critical to folding and structural stability. Within this framework, the identification of glycosylation sites that are structurally dispensable can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms of the shield and inform immune surveillance. In this work, we show through over 45 μs of cumulative sampling from conventional and enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, how the structure of the immunodominant S receptor binding domain (RBD) is regulated by <i>N</i>-glycosylation at N343 and how this glycan’s structural role changes from WHu-1, alpha (B.1.1.7), and beta (B.1.351), to the delta (B.1.617.2), and omicron (BA.1 and BA.2.86) variants. More specifically, we find that the amphipathic nature of the <i>N</i>-glycan is instrumental to preserve the structural integrity of the RBD hydrophobic core and that loss of glycosylation at N343 triggers a specific and consistent conformational change. We show how this change allosterically regulates the conformation of the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the WHu-1, alpha, and beta RBDs, but not in the delta and omicron variants, due to mutations that reinforce the RBD architecture. In support of these findings, we show that the binding of the RBD to monosialylated ganglioside co-receptors is highly dependent on N343 glycosylation in the WHu-1, but not in the delta RBD, and that affinity changes significantly across VoCs. Ultimately, the molecular and functional insight we provide in this work reinforces our understanding of the role of glycosylation in protein structure and function and it also allows us to identify the structural constraints within which the glycosylation site at N343 can become a hotspot for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycan shield.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92350">The delayed kinetics of Myddosome formation explains why amyloid-beta aggregates trigger Toll-like receptor 4 less efficiently than lipopolysaccharide</a></h4>

              
                The Myddosome is a key innate immune signalling platform. It forms at the cell surface and contains MyD88 and IRAK proteins which ultimately coordinate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signals via the Myddosome when triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates but the magnitude and time duration of the response are very different for reasons that are unclear. Here, we followed the formation of Myddosomes in live macrophages using local delivery of TLR4 agonist to the cell surface and visualisation with 3D rapid light sheet imaging. This was complemented by super-resolution imaging of Myddosomes in fixed macrophages to determine the size of the signalling complex at different times after triggering. Myddosomes formed more rapidly after LPS than in response to sonicated Aβ 1–42 fibrils (80 vs 372 s). The mean lifetimes of the Myddosomes were also shorter when triggered by LPS compared to sonicated Aβ fibrils (170 and 220 s), respectively. In both cases, a range of Myddosome of different sizes (50–500 nm) were formed. In particular, small round Myddosomes around 100 nm in size formed at early time points, then reduced in proportion over time. Collectively, our data suggest that compared to LPS the multivalency of Aβ fibrils leads to the formation of larger Myddosomes which form more slowly and, due to their size, take longer to disassemble. This explains why sonicated Aβ fibrils results in less efficient triggering of TLR4 signalling and may be a general property of protein aggregates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94180">SCC3 is an axial element essential for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein that plays a pivotal role in holding sister chromatids together during cell division. Sister chromatid cohesion 3 (SCC3), constituents of cohesin complex, is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Since the deletion of individual cohesin subunit always causes lethality, it is difficult to dissect its biological function in both mitosis and meiosis. Here, we obtained <i>scc3</i> weak mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 system to explore its function during rice mitosis and meiosis. The <i>scc3</i> weak mutants displayed obvious vegetative defects and complete sterility, underscoring the essential roles of SCC3 in both mitosis and meiosis. SCC3 is localized on chromatin from interphase to prometaphase in mitosis. However, in meiosis, SCC3 acts as an axial element during early prophase I and subsequently situates onto centromeric regions following the disassembly of the synaptonemal complex. The loading of SCC3 onto meiotic chromosomes depends on REC8. <i>scc3</i> shows severe defects in homologous pairing and synapsis. Consequently, SCC3 functions as an axial element that is essential for maintaining homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87450">Quantifying gliding forces of filamentous cyanobacteria by self-buckling</a></h4>

              
                Filamentous cyanobacteria are one of the oldest and today still most abundant lifeforms on earth, with manifold implications in ecology and economics. Their flexible filaments, often several hundred cells long, exhibit gliding motility in contact with solid surfaces. The underlying force generating mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that propulsion forces and friction coefficients are strongly coupled in the gliding motility of filamentous cyanobacteria. We directly measure their bending moduli using micropipette force sensors, and quantify propulsion and friction forces by analyzing their self-buckling behavior, complemented with analytical theory and simulations. The results indicate that slime extrusion unlikely generates the gliding forces, but support adhesion-based hypotheses, similar to the better-studied single-celled myxobacteria. The critical self-buckling lengths align well with the peaks of natural length distributions, indicating the importance of self-buckling for the organization of their collective in natural and artificial settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88375">RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL alternatively determines the fate of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) leukemia is a fatal hematological malignancy. Although standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved remarkable success in prolonging patient survival, intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues for patients with Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia. Here, we report a new leukemogenic process in which RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Consequently, neddylated BCR-ABL enhances the stability by competing its c-CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Moreover, in contrast to in vivo ineffectiveness of PROTAC-based degraders, depletion of RAPSYN expression, or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and, in turn, inhibited tumor formation and growth. Collectively, these findings represent an alternative to tyrosine kinase activity for the oncoprotein and leukemogenic cells and generate a rationale of targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation for the treatment of Ph<sup>+</sup> leukemia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91808">Phosphate as an adjunct to calcium in promoting coronary vascular calcification in chronic inflammatory states</a></h4>

              
                Bone releases calcium and phosphate in response to pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated inflammation. The body develops impaired urinary excretion of phosphate with age and chronic inflammation given the reduction of the kidney protein Klotho, which is essential to phosphate excretion. Phosphate may also play a role in the development of the resistance of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to circulating calcium thus contributing to calcium retention in the circulation. Phosphate can contribute to vascular smooth muscle dedifferentiation with manifestation of osteoblastogenesis and ultimately endovascular calcium phosphate precipitation. Thus phosphate, along with calcium, contributes to the calcification and inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques and the origin of these elements is likely the bone, which serves as storage for the majority of the body’s supply of extracellular calcium and phosphate. Early cardiac evaluation of patients with chronic inflammation and attempts at up-regulating the parathyroid CaSR with calcimimetics or introducing earlier anti-resorptive treatment with bone active pharmacologic agents may serve to delay onset or reduce the quantity of atherosclerotic plaque calcification in these patients.

	<p>This paper proposes a new hybrid model for classifying stress states using EEG signals, combining multi-domain transfer entropy (TrEn) with a two-dimensional PCANet (2D-PCANet) approach. The aim is to create an automated system for identifying stress levels, which is crucial for early intervention and mental health management. A major challenge in this field lies in extracting meaningful emotional information from the complex patterns observed in EEG. Our model addresses this by initially applying independent component analysis (ICA) to purify the EEG signals, enhancing the clarity for further analysis. We then leverage the adaptability of the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) to represent the EEG data in time, frequency, and time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency domains. This multi-domain representation allows for a more nuanced understanding of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s activity in response to stress. The subsequent stage involves the deployment of a two-layer 2D-PCANet network designed to autonomously distill EEG features associated with stress. These features are then classified by a support vector machine (SVM) to determine the stress state. Moreover, stress induction and data acquisition experiments are designed. We employed two distinct tasks known to trigger stress responses. Other stress-inducing elements that enhance the stress response were included in the experimental design, such as time limits and performance feedback. The EEG data collected from 15 participants were retained. The proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of over 92% on this self-collected dataset, enabling stress state detection under different task-induced conditions.</p>

	<p>Panic disorder (PD) and focal epilepsy, in particular, temporal lobe epilepsy, often present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical manifestations. This article describes the case of a 25-year-old female, misdiagnosed with PD for 15 years, whose recurring episodes of sudden fear, palpitations, and nausea were later identified as manifestations of focal epilepsy. Initially unresponsive to conventional anti-anxiety medications, the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s correct diagnosis was only established through comprehensive electro-clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evaluations during her admission to our research hospital. Long-term video&amp;amp;ndash;EEG monitoring (LTVEM) played a pivotal role in identifying the epileptic nature of her episodes, which were characterized by paroxysmal activity in the right temporal and zygomatic regions, consistent with the location of a dysplastic lesion in the right amygdala, as revealed by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. These findings underline the importance of considering focal epilepsy in the differential diagnosis of PD, especially in cases refractory to standard psychiatric treatments. The misdiagnosis of epilepsy as PD can lead to significant delays in appropriate treatment, potentially exacerbating the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition and affecting their quality of life. This case emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach and the utilization of advanced diagnostic tools like LTVEM in elucidating the underlying causes of paroxysmal psychiatric symptoms.</p>

                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (EPWB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on EPWB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and EPWB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

                Background The pedicle screw rod system is believed to correction of 3-dimensional deformity and maintain the results of the correction, so the better sagittal balance correction can be expected. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 43 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who performed correction, stabilization and posterior fusion to determine the effect of spinal and spinopelvic components on sagittal balance correction. X-ray data were measured for thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis as the spinal components and pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS) as the spinopelvic components. Further evaluations include sagittal spinal balance (C7PL), global sagittal balance, and sacrofemoral distance pre- and post-surgery. Statistical evaluation is performed to determine the correlation between the spinal and the spinopelvic components and the achievement of sagittal balance correction. Results TK/Sagittal Modifier obtained a significant correction with an average is 18.69° (±9.57), while LL (lumbar lordosis) has 44.58 ° (±11.94). Average of C7PL correction is 0.68 cm (±3.13), Global Sagittal Balance is -2.04 cm (±3.24), and SCFD is 2.69 cm (±2.48). The TK/LL degree doesn’t significantly influence on Global Sagittal Balance and C7PL. The TK degree significantly affects SCFD, whereas LL doesn’t significantly affect SCFD. Changes in each spinopelvic component are not significant in affecting Global Sagittal Balance. Conclusions Correction and stabilization of AIS’s patients using the pedicle screw rod system resulted in significant Spinal Component TK/Sagittal Modifier and LL correction. Meanwhile, Spinopelvic Components didn’t achieve significant correction. Mean correction of C7PL is -2.66 (±4.4) and Global Sagittal is -3.11 cm (±4.94), SCFD only managed to correct 37.3%. Global Sagittal Balance is not significantly affected by all components of Spinopelvic components, while the C7PL is only affected by PT. Only PT and SS that significantly affected SCFD.

                <p>Tic disorders (TD) are characterized by the presence of motor and/or vocal tics. Common neurophysiological frameworks suggest dysregulations of the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) brain circuit that controls movement execution. Besides common tics, there are other "non-tic" symptoms that are primarily related to sensory perception, sensorimotor integration, attention, and social cognition. The existence of these symptoms, the sensory tic triggers, and the modifying effect of attention and cognitive control mechanisms on tics may indicate the salience network's (SN) involvement in the neurophysiology of TD. Resting-state functional MRI measurements were performed in 26 participants with TD and 25 healthy controls (HC). The group differences in resting-state functional connectivity patterns were measured based on seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses. Compared to HC, patients with TD exhibited altered connectivity between the core regions of the SN (insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal junction) and sensory, associative, and motor-related cortices. Furthermore, connectivity changes were observed in relation to the severity of tics in the TD group. The SN, particularly the insula, is likely to be an important site of dysregulation in TD. Our results provide evidence for large-scale neural deviations in TD beyond the CSTC pathologies. These findings may be relevant for developing treatment targets.</p>

                Background Previous Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of obesity susceptibility genes in different populations have confirmed the association of some variants with obesity, body mass index (BMI), and some related metabolic traits. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to investigate the genetic basis of obesity in the Jordanian population. The aim of our study is to investigate the occurrence and frequency of obesity-related genes in Jordanian individuals and any possible relationship between SNP genetic markers and phenotypic characteristics of studied individuals. Methods A total of 150 Jordanian unrelated adults, including 83 obese, 26 overweight, and 41 normal-weight subjects, were genotyped using the high resolution melt analysis (HRMA) and tested for the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2167270 in LEP gene and rs1137100 in LEPR gene, with obesity risk, obesity/overweight risk, BMI, weight, height, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood level glucose. Results A significant association between obesity risk and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed under a dominant model (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5147, 95% CI =1.0629 to 5.9494, p = 0.0358). A marginal (not significant) association between BMI and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene (p = 0.075), was also detected. Moreover, an association between rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene and glucose blood level was observed (p = 0.038). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol also presented a weak association with the rs1137100 mutation in LEPR gene, with p = 0.071 and p = 0.078, respectively. Additionally, no significant association between LDL-cholesterol and the rs2167270 mutation in LEP gene was observed (p = 0.091). By contrast, there was no association between weight or height and the SNPs mutation evaluated in this study (p > 0.05). Conclusions These results suggest that some SNPs in some obesity-related genes may contribute to obesity risk and its related anthropometric and metabolic traits in Jordanian population. To confirm these results, further studies on a larger Jordanian cohort should be carried out.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those on hemodialysis, are at increased risk of developing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Guidelines suggest that all patients with CKD should be vaccinated against HBV, but these guidelines are usually not followed. We conducted this study to know the status of vaccination against HBV in CKD patients on regular hemodialysis. Methods This observational descriptive study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Teaching Hospital, Poonch Medical College Rawalakot , and POF Teaching Hospital, Wah Medical College Wah Cantt, from March to July 2019. Patients reporting to the dialysis center of both hospitals on regular dialysis were included in the study. Patient information (HBV vaccination status, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, duration of CKD and duration of dialysis) were collected on a specially designed questionnaire. The statistical analysis of data was done in SPSS for Windows, version 20. Results A total 149 patients were included in the study, 63.1% were male and 36.9% were female. Out of these 24.2% were uneducated, 33.6% had 1–10 years school education, 38.2% had 10–14 years education, and 4% had more than 14 years education. About 35% patients were from low socioeconomic class, 54% from middle and 11% from higher class. Only 45.6% (n=68) of patients were vaccinated and 54.4% (n=81) were not vaccinated against HBV. Vaccination status was significantly associated with education (p=0.004) and socioeconomic status (p=0.008). Conclusion The HBV status of patients on regular hemodialysis is not satisfactory at the two centers observed. It is associated with education and socioeconomic status of the patient.

                Background Gender equity in academia is a significant challenge. To investigate career advancement perspectives of mid-career female physician-scientists, identify their needs and barriers, and develop a mentor-sponsorship strategy to improve their representation in higher academic ranks. Methods In this qualitative study, conducted at a Western European academic medical center, we interviewed 19 mid-career female physician-scientists across all specialties, including radiology. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: 1. Horizontal and vertical ambitions, (i.e., knowledge expansion and hierarchical advancement) 2. Evaluation of talent, 3. Career path needs, and 4. Receiving support. These themes revealed barriers to women's advancement, including limited talent recognition, inadequate leadership support, self-limiting beliefs, structural issues, and lack of networking opportunities. To address these challenges, a mentor-sponsorship program should prioritize sponsor training, start immediately at the beginning of the mid-career phase (attainment of assistant professorship), emphasize horizontal and vertical development, take work-life balance into account, establish mentor networks, and allow individuals to choose mentors and sponsors based on their needs and aspirations. Conclusions This study has identified key needs and barriers that impede the advancement of female physician-scientists in academia. To address these challenges, a tailored mentor-sponsorship program is recommended. Key program elements include training leadership to recognize talent and offer proactive support, starting at the onset of the mid-career phase, emphasizing horizontal and vertical development, and establishing a strong mentor-sponsor network with thoughtful matching. These actions can help to overcome obstacles and facilitate the progress of women in academia.

                This study aimed to validate the Worker Well-Being Questionnaire, originally developed by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in the Malay language. The translation process involved an initial independent translation by a professional translator, followed by a comparison of translations to synthesize a unified version, which was subsequently back-translated. The back-translations were then reviewed by an expert committee to create a finalized questionnaire version. The results of this validation study indicate a high level of satisfaction, demonstrating an excellent fit with confirmatory factor analysis (CFI and TLI values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99) and a low root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA values ranging from 0.03 to 0.07). Moreover, the questionnaire exhibits sound internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.7, and the factor structures align with theoretical expectations. In conclusion, the Malay version of the questionnaire faithfully reproduces the original instrument, enabling a robust and efficient assessment of workers’ well.

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created the need to evaluate drugs such as favipiravir (FPV), an antiviral inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and Maraviroc (MVC), an antiretroviral that antagonizes the chemokine receptor CCR5, which could affect the modulation of inflammation and viral replication in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the effect of MVC and/or FPV plus systemic steroid (SS) vs. SS alone on the viral load and progression to critical disease. Methods Sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 were evaluated in three treatment arms: 1) SS only (n=6), 2) SS plus one test drug MVC or FPV (n=5), and 3) SS plus both test drugs (MVC and FPV, n=5). The viral load was determined for N, E, and RdRp viral genes. Results A significant decrease in viral load was observed in the three treatment groups, with a larger effect size in the group that combined SS with both test drugs. The E, N, and RdRp genes with Cohen’s d were 120%, 123%, and 50%, respectively. Conclusions The largest effect on viral load reduction, as measured by effect size, was observed in the combination treatment group; however, no statistical significance was found, and it did not prevent progression to critical illness.

                Background There is an essential need for cardiomyocyte regeneration among patients with heart failure. Transplantation of dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells may lead to an improvement of cardiomyocyte regeneration among heart failure patients. We believe that DFAT cells are promising candidate cell sources for cardiac regeneration. However, the pathway underlying how DFAT cells of the adipose lineage differentiate into mature cardiomyocytes isn’t fully understood. Methods We conducted an experimental laboratory study on isolated DFAT cells from adipose tissue of healthy adults. Then, we treated cells with different concentrations of reversine (10, 20 and 40 nM), and performed RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Next, we used a ceiling culture method based on the buoyancy properties of mature lipid-filled adipocytes. Stemness expression (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4], brachyury, Fetal liver kinase 1 [Flk-1]) was quantified by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, while cardiomyocyte expression (Transcription factor GATA-4 [GATA4] and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) was quantified by immunocytochemistry. Results ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc found that 10 nM reversine increased greater Flk-1 expression compared to the control group (MD: 5.037 + 0.998; p < 0.001), but there were no significant changes among Oct4 (MD: 0.013 + 1.244; p = 0.99) and brachyury expression (MD: 0.157 + 0.084; p = 0.252). Kruskal-Wallis revealed that the expression of GATA4 (1.65 [0.41-1.98] to 0.015 [0.007-0.034]; p =0.017) reduced significantly from day 7 until day 21 and cTnT (5.07 [6.62-8.91] to 8.22 [6.81-9.40]; p= 0.001) increased significantly from day 7 until day 21. Conclusions Reversine could increase the expression of Flk-1, but it was unable to stimulate the expression of Oct4 and brachyury related to cell stemness. An optimal concentration of 10 nM reversine may have the greatest effect on enhancing the differentiation of DFAT cells into mature cardiomyocytes, as indicated by higher cTnT expression between cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-617/v1?src=rss">Zoom fatigue related to online learning among medical students in Thailand:  Prevalence, predictors, and association with depression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning pattern of medical students shifted from onsite to online. This transition may contribute to what has been called “Zoom fatigue.” This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Zoom fatigue related to online learning, identify associated factors of Zoom fatigue, and explore its correlation with depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1st to 6th-year Thai medical students. The online survey was administered using a demographic and health behavior questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Thai version of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF-T). Results Among the 386 participating students, 221 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 20.6 years. The prevalence of high Zoom fatigue was 9.6%. In the multivariable regression analysis, a lower academic year and a higher number of online learning sessions were significant predictors of Zoom fatigue (p < 0.001), while regular exercise emerged as a protective factor (p = 0.009). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 61.9%, and a significant correlation was found between having a depressive disorder and experiencing Zoom fatigue (p = 0.004). Conclusion Zoom fatigue among medical students was correlated with depression. Consequently, medical students experiencing Zoom fatigue should undergo further assessment for depression. It is crucial to closely monitor medical students in lower academic years with a high number of online sessions for signs of Zoom fatigue. Additionally, implementing strategies, such as reducing the frequency of online sessions and promoting regular exercise, may help alleviate the symptoms.

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Abstract* Background Telemedicine has improved adherence to heart failure (HF) treatment, however it has not yet been tailored specifically to address HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our objective is to undertake a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research studies that focus on telemedicine in HFrEF. Methods We conducted an extensive literature review encompassing trials which included outpatients with HFrEF who underwent telemedicine compared with usual care. We exclude any studies without ejection fraction data. Three bibliographic databases from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library were utilized in our search from January 1999 to May 2023. The endpoints of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF-related hospitalization. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) and the risk of bias in non-randomized studies – of interventions (ROBINS-I) were used for non-randomized or observational studies. To quantitatively analyze the collective findings, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each outcome. Results Out of the initial pool of 4,947 articles, we narrowed down our analysis to 27 studies, Results showed that telemedicine significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 – 0.78; p<0.00001), cardiovascular-related mortality (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 – 0.80, p < 0.00001), and HF-related hospitalization based on number of events (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 – 0.94, p = 0.009) as well as number of patients (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 – 0.87, p < 0.0001). Conclusion Telemedicine was shown significantly beneficial in decreasing mortality and hospitalization in HFrEF patients. Future research should focus on standardizing effective telemedicine practices due to the existing variability in methods and clinical situation of the patients.

                Introduction Hemiplegia is the common term used to describe a multitude of clinical problems associated with a stroke. Hemiplegic stroke accounts for 70-85% of all first strokes. Trunk stability is impaired due to hypertonia and weakness in hemiplegia. Impaired trunk control leads to gait and postural abnormalities which if left untreated causes permanent disability in hemiplegics. Objective To investigate the scope of research on the benefits of explicit training using Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT) for enhancing tone and postural control in subjects with hemiplegic stroke. Methods In order to adhere to established protocols of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, the systematic review will be carried out to find pertinent studies published up to the search date, and a thorough search strategy will be applied across popular electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. This systematic review methodology has been registered in PROSPERO for rigorous and transparent dissemination of study search, synthesis, and analysis. Discussion As the motor impairments due to abnormal tone and postural impairment in hemiplegic stroke substantially impact a stroke survivor’s quality of life, this study will provide a thorough and methodical approach to synthesize and report the merits and demerits on the effectiveness of NDT in enhancing tone and postural control, considering the potential variability in interventions and outcomes, and the methodological rigor of particular studies. The review also intends to provide significant insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by critically analysing and summarizing the present state of research in this domain. This will facilitate evidence-based decision-making in rehabilitation techniques for patients with hemiplegic stroke. Systematic Review Registration number CRD42023476137

                <p>by Nikolaos M. Dimitriou, Salvador Flores-Torres, Maria Kyriakidou, Joseph Matthew Kinsella, Georgios D. Mitsis</p>

Cell sedimentation in 3D hydrogel cultures refers to the vertical migration of cells towards the bottom of the space. Understanding this poorly examined phenomenon may allow us to design better protocols to prevent it, as well as provide insights into the mechanobiology of cancer development. We conducted a multiscale experimental and mathematical examination of 3D cancer growth in triple negative breast cancer cells. Migration was examined in the presence and absence of Paclitaxel, in high and low adhesion environments and in the presence of fibroblasts. The observed behaviour was modeled by hypothesizing active migration due to self-generated chemotactic gradients. Our results confirmed this hypothesis, whereby migration was likely to be regulated by the MAPK and TGF-βpathways. The mathematical model enabled us to describe the experimental data in absence (normalized error<40%) and presence of Paclitaxel (normalized error<10%), suggesting inhibition of random motion and advection in the latter case. Inhibition of sedimentation in low adhesion and co-culture experiments further supported the conclusion that cells actively migrated downwards due to the presence of signals produced by cells already attached to the adhesive glass surface.

                Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK, encoded by the SYK gene, is a non-receptor type protein kinase which mediates immune signal transduction through immunoreceptors. Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK expression has been associated with the development of various inflammatory diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions. The reproducibility of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK research would help elucidate the mechanism in which it causes neuroinflammation as well as its potential as a novel target to treat Alzheimer’s disease. This would be facilitated with the availability of high-quality tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. In this study, we characterized thirteen tyrosine-protein kinase SYK commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neuron impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and if and how transplantation of healthy GABAergic neurons can improve AD, remain unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human-derived medial ganglionic eminence progenitors (hiMGEs) differentiated from programmed induced neural precursor cells (hiNPCs) were injected into the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (HIP).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that grafts migrate to the whole brain and form functional synaptic connections in amyloid precursor protein gene/ presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) chimeric mice. Following transplantation of hiMGEs, behavioral deficits and AD-related pathology were alleviated and defective neurons were repaired. Notably, exosomes secreted from hiMGEs, which are rich in anti-inflammatory miRNA, inhibited astrocyte activation <i>in</i>
<i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and the mechanism was related to regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that hiMGEs transplantation is an alternative treatment for neuronal loss in AD and demonstrate that exosomes with anti-inflammatory activity derived from hiMGEs are important factors for graft survival. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Cerebral vasculitis is a rare but severe complication of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), presenting significant challenges in management due to its potential for devastating neurological consequences and poor prognosis. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with known SLE who presented with seizures, declining cognitive function, and unresponsiveness. Neurological examination, laboratory investigations, and radiological imaging supported the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis secondary to SLE. Despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, the patient’s neurological status continued to deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction. Ultimately, the patient succumbed to multiorgan failure attributed to severe CNS vasculitis and its complications. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of cerebral vasculitis in SLE while highlighting the need for further research into more effective therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the clinical progression of the brain-/body-first categories within Lewy body disease (LBD): Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and PD dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to establish a population-based cohort of clinically diagnosed LBD. We used two definitions for differentiating between brain- and body-first LBD: a previously hypothesized body-first presentation in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior onset before motor symptoms onset; and an expanded definition of body-first LBD when a patient had at least 2 premotor symptoms between constipation, erectile dysfunction, rapid eye movement sleep behavior, anosmia, or neurogenic bladder.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Brain-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with PD (RR = 1.43, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas body-first patients were more likely to be diagnosed with DLB (RR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Under the expanded definition, there was no difference in LBD diagnosis between brain-first and body-first patients (PD: RR = 1.03, <i>p</i> = 0.10; DLB: RR = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.58) There were no patterns between brain- or body-first presentation, PD dementia under either definition (original: <i>p</i> = 0.09, expanded: <i>p</i> = 0.97), and no significant difference in motor symptoms between brain-first and body-first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings do not support the dichotomous classification of body-first and brain-first LBD with the currently proposed definition. Biological exposures resulting in PD and DLB are unlikely to converge on a binary classification of top-down or bottom-up synuclein pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Motor learning is central to human existence, such as learning to speak or walk, sports moves, or rehabilitation after injury. Evidence suggests that all forms of motor learning share an evolutionarily conserved molecular plasticity pathway. Here, we present novel insights into the neural processes underlying operant self-learning, a form of motor learning in the fruit fly Drosophila. Methods We operantly trained wild type and transgenic Drosophila fruit flies, tethered at the torque meter, in a motor learning task that required them to initiate and maintain turning maneuvers around their vertical body axis (yaw torque). We combined this behavioral experiment with transgenic peptide expression, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, spatio-temporally controlled gene knock-out and confocal microscopy. Results We find that expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) in direct wing steering motoneurons co-expressing the transcription factor FoxP is necessary for this type of motor learning and that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways. We also found that it takes more than a week for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of FoxP in adult animals to impair motor learning, suggesting that adult FoxP expression is required for operant self-learning. Conclusions Our experiments suggest that, for operant self-learning, a type of motor learning in Drosophila, co-expression of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and the transcription factor FoxP is necessary in direct wing steering motoneurons. Some of these neurons control the wing beat amplitude when generating optomotor responses, and we have discovered modulation of optomotor behavior after operant self-learning. We also discovered that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways and that FoxP expression is also required in adult flies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a barrier between the circulatory system and the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to CNS protection and maintaining the brain homeostasis. Establishment of in vitro BBB models that are closer to the microenvironment of the human brain is helpful for evaluating the potential and efficiency of a drug penetrating BBB and thus the clinical application value of the drug. The in vitro BBB models not only provide great convenience for screening new drugs that can access to CNS but also help people to have a deeper study on the mechanism of substances entering and leaving the brain, which makes people have greater opportunities in the treatment of CNS diseases. Up to now, although much effort has been paid to the researches on the in vitro BBB models and many progresses have been achieved, no unified method has been described for establishing a BBB model and there is much work to do and many challenges to be faced with in the future. This review summarizes the research progresses in the establishment, evaluation, and application of in vitro BBB models.</p>

<p>The new rTMS therapeutic module (iTBS) can alter microglial polarization and improve motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation with ischemic stroke in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroinflammation caused by excessive microglial activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulatory technique that has recently been reported to regulate microglial functions and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The intermittent burst stimulation (iTBS) regimen in rTMS improves neuronal excitability. However, whether iTBS exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating neurons and thereby modulating microglial polarization remains unclear. Motor function was assessed after 1 week of rTMS (iTBS regimen) treatment in adult male mice with occlusion/reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO/r) injury. We also investigated the molecular biological alterations associated with microglial polarization using a cell proliferation assay, multiplex cytokine bioassays, and immunofluorescence staining. iTBS regimen can improve balance and motor coordination function, increase spontaneous movement, and improve walking function in mice with early cerebral ischemia injury. Expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 increased significantly in mice with MCAO injury. Especially, rTMS significantly increased the number of proliferating cells in the infarcted cortex. The fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in the peri-infarct area of MCAO injured mice was low, but the signal was broader. Compared with MCAO group, the fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in rTMS group was significantly increased. rTMS inhibited pro-inflammatory M1 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD86<sup>+</sup>) and improved anti-inflammatory M2 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup>) in the peri-infarct zone, thus significantly changing the phenotypic ratio M1/M2. rTMS improves motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cerebral I/R injury in mice by regulating microglial polarization.</p>

                Neurons have high energy demands. In a recent study, Looser et al. identified oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 as the activity-dependent driver of oligodendrocyte glycolysis that ensures that lactate is supplied to active neurons. Given that oligodendrocyte Kir4.1 also influenced axonal glucose consumption and uptake, oligodendrocytes may play a broader role in neuronal metabolic regulation.

                In the nervous system, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and, ultimately, behavior through spatiotemporally precise initiation of a variety of signaling pathways. However, despite their critical importance, there is incomplete understanding of how these receptors are regulated to tune their signaling to specific neurophysiological contexts. A deeper mechanistic picture of neuromodulatory GPCR function is needed to fully decipher their biological roles and effectively harness them for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we highlight recent progress in identifying novel modes of regulation of neuromodulatory GPCRs, including G protein- and receptor-targeting mechanisms, receptor–receptor crosstalk, and unique features that emerge in the context of chemical synapses. These emerging principles of neuromodulatory GPCR tuning raise critical questions to be tackled at the molecular, cellular, synaptic, and neural circuit levels in the future.

                Creamer et al. show that a protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic isoform is sequestered into aggregates to regulate PKA kinase activity in response to heat stress. Reversible sequestration requires the Hsp42 chaperone, providing a mechanism to control a key cellular signaling pathway in a catalytic-isoform-specific manner.

                Tan et al. report that TAGLN+ cells located in the periphery of the nucleus pulposus (NP) are characteristic of progenitors. The TAGLN+ PeriNP cells are proliferative and contribute to the inner part of the NP. These PeriNP cells become diminished during age and puncture-induced disc degeneration. SMAD4-dependent pathways regulate the maintenance and differentiation of the TAGLN+ PeriNP cells.

                Sudholz et al. identify DOT1L as a key regulator of NK cell phenotype and function. DOT1L-deficient NK cells exhibit an enhanced intILC1/ILC1 phenotype, irrespective of TGF-β. Conditional DOT1L knockout mice display decreased tumor control. We conclude that DOT1L may support MEF2C expression, which allows optimal NK cell phenotype and function.

                Understanding the rules that control the composition of the HLA class I ligandome is highly important in the design of cancer immunotherapies. Bresser et al. show that the prediction of HLA class I ligands can be significantly improved by incorporation of gene and protein sequence features of source proteins.
