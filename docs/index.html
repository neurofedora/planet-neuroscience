	<p>The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep neural networks in various domains. However, deep neural networks are very resource-intensive in terms of energy consumption, data requirements, and high computational costs. With the recent increasing need for the autonomy of machines in the real world, e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and collaborative robots, exploitation of deep neural networks in those applications has been actively investigated. In those applications, energy and computational efficiencies are especially important because of the need for real-time responses and the limited energy supply. A promising solution to these previously infeasible applications has recently been given by biologically plausible spiking neural networks. Spiking neural networks aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, using biologically realistic models of neurons to carry out the computation. Due to their functional similarity to the biological neural network, spiking neural networks can embrace the sparsity found in biology and are highly compatible with temporal code. Our contributions in this work are: (i) we give a comprehensive review of theories of biological neurons; (ii) we present various existing spike-based neuron models, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we detail synapse models; (iv) we provide a review of artificial neural networks; (v) we provide detailed guidance on how to train spike-based neuron models; (vi) we revise available spike-based neuron frameworks that have been developed to support implementing spiking neural networks; (vii) finally, we cover existing spiking neural network applications in computer vision and robotics domains. The paper concludes with discussions of future perspectives.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Inhibition by Shh Signaling-Dependent Stellate Cell Pool Is Critical for Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cerebellar inhibitory interneurons are important regulators of neural circuit activity for diverse motor and nonmotor functions. The molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), consisting of basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs), provide dendritic and somatic inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells, respectively. They are sequentially generated in an inside-out pattern from Pax2<sup>+</sup> immature interneurons, which migrate from the prospective white matter to the ML of the cortex. However, little is known about how MLI subtype identities and pool sizes are determined, nor are their contributions to motor learning well understood. Here, we show that GABAergic progenitors fated to generate both BCs and SCs respond to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal. Conditional abrogation of Shh signaling of either sex inhibited proliferation of GABAergic progenitors and reduced the number of Pax2<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas persistent Shh pathway activation increased their numbers. These changes, however, did not affect early born BC numbers but selectively altered the SC pool size. Moreover, genetic depletion of GABAergic progenitors when BCs are actively generated also resulted in a specific reduction of SCs, suggesting that the specification of MLI subtypes is independent of Shh signaling and their birth order and likely occurs after Pax2<sup>+</sup> cells settle into their laminar positions in an inside-out sequence. Mutant mice with reduced SC numbers displayed decreased dendritic inhibitory synapses and neurotransmission onto Purkinje cells, resulting in an impaired acquisition of eyeblink conditioning. These findings also reveal an essential role of Shh signaling-dependent SCs in regulating inhibitory dendritic synapses and motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebellar circuit that enables fine motor learning involves MLIs of BCs and SCs, which provide dendritic and somatic inhibitory synapses onto Purkinje cells. Little is known about how their identities and numbers are determined, nor are their specific contributions to motor learning well understood. We show that MLI subtypes are specified independent of Shh signaling and their birth orders but appear to occur in their terminal laminar positions according to the inside-out sequence. This finding challenges the current view that MLI subtypes are specified sequentially at the progenitor level. We also demonstrate that dendritic inhibition by Shh signaling-dependent SC pool is necessary for motor learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Notch Inhibition Promotes Regeneration and Immunosuppression Supports Cone Survival in a Zebrafish Model of Inherited Retinal Dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Photoreceptor degeneration leads to irreversible vision loss in humans with retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa. Whereas photoreceptor loss is permanent in mammals, zebrafish possesses the ability to regenerate retinal neurons and restore visual function. Following acute damage, Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) re-enter the cell cycle and produce multipotent progenitors whose progeny differentiate into mature neurons. Both MG reprogramming and proliferation of retinal progenitor cells require reactive microglia and associated inflammatory signaling. Paradoxically, in zebrafish models of retinal degeneration, photoreceptor death does not induce the MG to reprogram and regenerate lost cells. Here, we used male and female zebrafish <I>cep290</I> mutants to demonstrate that progressive cone degeneration generates an immune response but does not stimulate MG proliferation. Acute light damage triggered photoreceptor regeneration in <I>cep290</I> mutants but cones were only restored to prelesion densities. Using <I>irf8</I> mutant zebrafish, we found that the chronic absence of microglia reduced inflammation and rescued cone degeneration in <I>cep290</I> mutants. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed sustained expression of <I>notch3</I> in MG of <I>cep290</I> mutants and inhibition of Notch signaling induced MG to re-enter the cell cycle. Our findings provide new insights on the requirements for MG to proliferate and the potential for immunosuppression to prolong photoreceptor survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are genetic diseases that lead to the progressive loss of photoreceptors and the permanent loss of vision. Zebrafish can regenerate photoreceptors after acute injury by reprogramming Mu&#x0308;ller glia (MG) into stem-like cells that produce retinal progenitors, but this regenerative process fails to occur in zebrafish models of IRDs. Here, we show that Notch pathway inhibition can promote photoreceptor regeneration in models of progressive degeneration and that immunosuppression can prevent photoreceptor loss. These results offer insight into the pathways that promote MG-dependent regeneration and the role of inflammation in photoreceptor degeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneous Spiking Is Governed by Broadband Fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Populations of cortical neurons generate rhythmic fluctuations in their ongoing spontaneous activity. These fluctuations can be seen in the local field potential (LFP), which reflects summed return currents from synaptic activity in the local population near a recording electrode. The LFP is spectrally broad, and many researchers view this breadth as containing many narrowband oscillatory components that may have distinct functional roles. This view is supported by the observation that the phase of narrowband oscillations is often correlated with cortical excitability and can relate to the timing of spiking activity and the fidelity of sensory evoked responses. Accordingly, researchers commonly tune in to these channels by narrowband filtering the LFP. Alternatively, neural activity may be fundamentally broadband and composed of transient, nonstationary rhythms that are difficult to approximate as oscillations. In this view, the instantaneous state of the broad ensemble relates directly to the excitability of the local population with no particular allegiance to any frequency band. To test between these alternatives, we asked whether the spiking activity of neocortical neurons in marmoset of either sex is better aligned with the phase of the LFP within narrow frequency bands or with a broadband measure. We find that the phase of broadband LFP fluctuations provides a better predictor of spike timing than the phase after filtering in narrow bands. These results challenge the view of the neocortex as a system composed of narrowband oscillators and supports a view in which neural activity fluctuations are intrinsically broadband.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research into the dynamical state of neural populations often attributes unique significance to the state of narrowband oscillatory components. However, rhythmic fluctuations in cortical activity are nonstationary and broad spectrum. We find that the timing of spontaneous spiking activity is better captured by the state of broadband fluctuations over any latent oscillatory component. These results suggest narrowband interpretations of rhythmic population activity may be limited, and broader representations may provide higher fidelity in describing moment-to-moment fluctuations in cortical activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping the Integration of Sensory Information across Fingers in Human Sensorimotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The integration of somatosensory signals across fingers is essential for dexterous object manipulation. Previous experiments suggest that this integration occurs in neural populations in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, the integration process has not been fully characterized, as previous studies have mainly used 2-finger stimulation paradigms. Here, we addressed this gap by stimulating all 31 single- and multifinger combinations. We measured population-wide activity patterns evoked during finger stimulation in human S1 and primary motor cortex (M1) using 7T fMRI in female and male participants. Using multivariate fMRI analyses, we found clear evidence of unique nonlinear interactions between fingers. In Brodmann area (BA) 3b, interactions predominantly occurred between pairs of neighboring fingers. In BA 2, however, we found equally strong interactions between spatially distant fingers, as well as interactions between finger triplets and quadruplets. We additionally observed strong interactions in the hand area of M1. In both M1 and S1, these nonlinear interactions did not reflect a general suppression of overall activity, suggesting instead that the interactions we observed reflect rich, nonlinear integration of sensory inputs from the fingers. We suggest that this nonlinear finger integration allows for a highly flexible mapping from finger sensory inputs to motor responses that facilitates dexterous object manipulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Processing of somatosensory information in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is essential for dexterous object manipulation. To successfully handle an object, the sensorimotor system needs to detect complex patterns of haptic information, which requires the nonlinear integration of sensory inputs across multiple fingers. Using multivariate fMRI analyses, we characterized brain activity patterns evoked by stimulating all single- and multifinger combinations. We report that progressively stronger multifinger interactions emerge in posterior S1 and in the primary motor cortex (M1), with interactions arising between inputs from neighboring and spatially distant fingers. Our results suggest that S1 and M1 provide the neural substrate necessary to support a flexible mapping from sensory inputs to motor responses of the hand.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortico-Cerebellar Connectivity Underlying Motor Control in Chronic Poststroke Individuals</a></h4>

              
                <p>The robust, reciprocal anatomic connections between the cerebellum and contralateral sensorimotor cerebral hemisphere underscore the strong physiological interdependence between these two regions in relation to human behavior. Previous studies have shown that damage to sensorimotor cortex can result in a lasting reduction of cerebellar metabolism, the magnitude of which has been linked to poor rehabilitative outcomes. A better understanding of movement-related cerebellar physiology as well as cortico-cerebellar coherence (CCC) in the chronic, poststroke state may be key to developing novel neuromodulatory techniques that promote upper limb motor rehabilitation. As a part of the first in-human phase I trial investigating the effects of deep brain stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) on chronic poststroke motor rehabilitation, we collected invasive recordings from DN and scalp EEG in participants (both sexes) with middle cerebral artery stroke during a visuo-motor tracking task. We investigated the excitability of ipsilesional cortex, DN, and their interaction as a function of motor impairment and performance. Our results indicate the following: (1) event-related oscillations in the ipsilesional cortex and DN were significantly correlated at movement onset in the low beta band, with moderately and severely impaired participants showing desynchronization and synchronization, respectively; and (2) significant CCC was observed during the isometric hold period in the low beta band, which was critical for maintaining task accuracy. Our findings support a strong coupling between ipsilesional cortex and DN in the low beta band during motor control across all impairment levels, which encourages the exploitation of the cerebello&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical pathway as a neuromodulation target to promote rehabilitation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cerebral infarct because of stroke can lead to lasting reduction in cerebellar metabolism, resulting in poor rehabilitative outcomes. Thorough investigation of the cerebellar electrophysiology, as well as cortico-cerebellar connectivity in humans that could provide key insights to facilitate the development of novel neuromodulatory technologies, has been lacking. As a part of the first in-human phase I trial investigating deep brain stimulation of the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) for chronic, poststroke motor rehabilitation, we collected invasive recordings from DN and scalp EEG while stroke survivors performed a motor task. Our data indicate strong coupling between ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and DN in the low beta band across all impairment levels encouraging the exploration of electrical stimulation of the DN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Stimulus Statistics Affect the Receptive Fields of Cells in Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>We studied the changes that neuronal receptive field (RF) models undergo when the statistics of the stimulus are changed from those of white Gaussian noise (WGN) to those of natural scenes (NSs), by fitting the models to multielectrode data recorded from primary visual cortex (V1) of female cats. This allowed the estimation of both a cascade of linear filters on the stimulus, as well as the static nonlinearities that map the output of the filters to the neuronal spike rates. We found that cells respond differently to these two classes of stimuli, with mostly higher spike rates and shorter response latencies to NSs than to WGN. The most striking finding was that NSs resulted in RFs that had additional uncovered filters compared with WGN. This finding was not an artifact of the higher spike rates observed for NSs relative to WGN, but rather was related to a change in coding. Our results reveal a greater extent of nonlinear processing in V1 neurons when stimulated using NSs compared with WGN. Our findings indicate the existence of nonlinear mechanisms that endow V1 neurons with context-dependent transmission of visual information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study addresses a fundamental question about the concept of the receptive field (RF): does the encoding of information depend on the context or statistical regularities of the stimulus type? We applied state-of-the-art RF modeling techniques to data collected from multielectrode recordings from cat visual cortex in response to two statistically distinct stimulus types: white Gaussian noise and natural scenes. We find significant differences between the RFs that emerge from our data-driven modeling. Natural scenes result in far more complex RFs that combine multiple features in the visual input. Our findings reveal that different regimes or modes of operation are at work in visual cortical processing depending on the information present in the visual input. The complexity of V1 neural coding appears to be dependent on the complexity of the stimulus. We believe this new finding will have interesting implications for our understanding of the efficient transmission of information in sensory systems, which is an integral assumption of many computational theories (e.g., efficient and predictive coding of sensory processing in the brain).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interactions between Brainstem Neurons That Regulate the Motility to the Stomach</a></h4>

              
                <p>Activity in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is essential to gastric motility regulation. We and others have previously shown that this activity is greatly influenced by local GABAergic signaling, primarily because of somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic neurons. To further understand the network dynamics associated with gastric motility control in the DVC, we focused on another neuron prominently distributed in this complex, neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurons. However, the effect of these neurons on gastric motility remains unknown. Here, we investigate the anatomic and functional characteristics of the NPY neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and their interactions with SST neurons using transgenic mice of both sexes. We sought to determine whether NPY neurons influence the activity of gastric-projecting neurons, synaptically interact with SST neurons, and affect end-organ function. Our results using combined neuroanatomy and optogenetic <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> show that NPY neurons are part of the gastric vagal circuit as they are trans-synaptically labeled by a viral tracer from the gastric antrum, are primarily excitatory as optogenetic activation of these neurons evoke EPSCs in gastric-antrum-projecting neurons, are functionally coupled to each other and reciprocally connected to SST neurons, whose stimulation has a potent inhibitory effect on the action potential firing of the NPY neurons, and affect gastric tone and motility as reflected by their robust optogenetic response <I>in vivo.</I> These findings indicate that interacting NPY and SST neurons are integral to the network that controls vagal transmission to the stomach.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brainstem neurons in the dorsal nuclear complex are essential for regulating vagus nerve activity that affects the stomach via tone and motility. Two distinct nonoverlapping populations of predominantly excitatory NPY neurons and predominantly inhibitory SST neurons form reciprocal connections with each other in the NTS and with premotor neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus to control gastric mechanics. Light activation and inhibition of NTS NPY neurons increased and decreased gastric motility, respectively, whereas both activation and inhibition of NTS SST neurons enhanced gastric motility</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Functional (ir)Relevance of Posterior Parietal Cortex during Audiovisual Change Detection</a></h4>

              
                <p>The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a key role in integrating sensory inputs from different modalities to support adaptive behavior. Neuronal activity in PPC reflects perceptual decision-making across behavioral tasks, but the mechanistic involvement of PPC is unclear. In an audiovisual change detection task, we tested the hypothesis that PPC is required to arbitrate between the noisy inputs from the two different modalities and help decide in which modality a sensory change occurred. In trained male mice, we found extensive single-neuron and population-level encoding of task-relevant visual and auditory stimuli, trial history, as well as upcoming behavioral responses. However, despite these rich neural correlates, which would theoretically be sufficient to solve the task, optogenetic inactivation of PPC did not affect visual or auditory performance. Thus, despite neural correlates faithfully tracking sensory variables and predicting behavioral responses, PPC was not relevant for audiovisual change detection. This functional dissociation questions the role of sensory- and task-related activity in parietal associative circuits during audiovisual change detection. Furthermore, our results highlight the necessity to dissociate functional correlates from mechanistic involvement when exploring the neural basis of perception and behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is active during many daily tasks, but capturing its function has remained challenging. Specifically, it is proposed to function as an integration hub for multisensory inputs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, rather than classical cue integration, mouse PPC is involved in the segregation and discrimination of sensory modalities. Surprisingly, although neural activity tracked current and past sensory stimuli and reflected the ongoing decision-making process, optogenetic inactivation did not affect task performance. Thus, we show an apparent redundancy of sensory and task-related activity in mouse PPC. These results narrow down the function of parietal circuits, as well as direct the search for those neural dynamics that causally drive perceptual decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain System for Social Categorization by Narrative Roles</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cognitive system applies categorical thinking to facilitate perception of the rich environment around us. In person cognition, research has focused on the roles of gender, race, age, or appearance in social categorical thinking. Here we investigated how narrative roles, as portrayed by different cinematic characters, are categorized in the neurocognitive system. Under functional MRI, 17 human participants (7 females) were asked to make different judgments regarding personality traits of 16 renowned cinematic characters representing four roles: hero, sidekick, mentor, and villain. Classification analysis showed a brain network, comprising the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus and the temporoparietal junction bilaterally, and the left occipital face area (OFA), to discriminate among the four roles. No such classification was found between other individual attributes including age or the associated film. Moreover, regions overlapping the default mode network (DMN) were found to better discriminate between roles, rather than the individual characters, while the OFA was found to better discriminate between individuals. These results demonstrate the inherent role of roles in person cognition, and suggest an intimate relation between roles categorization and self-referential activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social categorization, the assignment of different people in our social network to subgroups, is a powerful strategy in social cognition. How is this managed by the brain? We provide evidence that different characters from different stories, representing similar roles in their corresponding narrative, elicit similar brain activation patterns, as revealed by functional MRI. Unlike previous studies of social categorization, these brain activations were similar to those elicited by social cognition rather than face processing, and included regions at the prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the temporoparietal junction. The identified brain network significantly overlapped the default mode network. We suggest that social categorization by roles is fundamental to the cognitive system, relying on brain regions related to social cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Dependent Plasticity in the Temporal Association Cortex Originates from the Primary Auditory Cortex, and Is Modified by the Secondary Auditory Cortex and the Medial Geniculate Body</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain areas that mediate the formation of auditory threat memory and perceptual decisions remain uncertain to date. Candidates include the primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortex, the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGm), amygdala, and the temporal association cortex. We used chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations with <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> patch-clamp recordings to assess the roles of these brain regions in threat memory learning in female mice. We found that conditioned sound (CS) frequency-dependent plasticity resulted in the formation of auditory threat memory in the temporal association cortex. This neural correlated auditory threat memory depended on CS frequency information from A1 glutamatergic subthreshold monosynaptic inputs, CS lateral inhibition from A2 glutamatergic disynaptic inputs, and non&ndash;frequency-specific facilitation from MGm glutamatergic monosynaptic inputs. These results indicate that the A2 and MGm work together in an inhibitory-facilitative role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:</b> The ability to recognize specific sounds to avoid predators or seek prey is a useful survival tool. Improving this ability through experiential learning is an added advantage requiring neural plasticity. As an example, humans must learn to distinguish the sound of a car horn, and thus avoid oncoming traffic. Our research discovered that the temporal association cortex can encode this kind of auditory information through tonal receptive field plasticity. In addition, the results revealed the underlying synaptic mechanisms of this process. These results extended our understanding of how meaningful auditory information is processed in an animal's brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Animal-to-Animal Variability in Partial Hippocampal Remapping in Repeated Environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal place cells form a map of the environment of an animal. Changes in the hippocampal map can be brought about in a number of ways, including changes to the environment, task, internal state of the subject, and the passage of time. These changes in the hippocampal map have been called remapping. In this study, we examine remapping during repeated exposure to the same environment. Different animals can have different remapping responses to the same changes. This variability across animals in remapping behavior is not well understood. In this work, we analyzed electrophysiological recordings from the CA3 region of the hippocampus performed by <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B1">Alme et al. (2014)</cross-ref>, in which five male rats were exposed to 11 different environments, including a variety of repetitions of those environments. To compare the hippocampal maps between two experiences, we computed average rate map correlation coefficients. We found changes in the hippocampal maps between different sessions in the same environment. These changes consisted of partial remapping, a form of remapping in which some place cells maintain their place fields, whereas other place cells remap their place fields. Each animal exhibited partial remapping differently. We discovered that the heterogeneity in hippocampal representational changes across animals is structured; individual animals had consistently different levels of partial remapping across a range of independent comparisons. Our findings highlight that partial hippocampal remapping between repeated environments depends on animal-specific factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Context identification is a difficult problem. Animals are not provided with objective context identity labels, so they must infer which experiences come from which contexts. Different animals may have different strategies for performing this inference. We find that different animals have stereotypically different extents of partial hippocampal remapping, a neural correlate of subjective assessment of context identity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Blocking Mitochondrial Zn2+ Accumulation after Ischemia Reduces Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Neuronal Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Zn<sup>2+</sup> is an important contributor to ischemic brain injury, and recent studies support the hypothesis that mitochondria are key sites of its injurious effects. In murine hippocampal slices (both sexes) subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), we found that Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and its entry into mitochondria precedes and contributes to the induction of acute neuronal death. In addition, if the ischemic episode is short (and sublethal), there is ongoing Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in CA1 mitochondria after OGD that may contribute to their delayed dysfunction. Using this slice model of sublethal OGD, we have examined Zn<sup>2+</sup> contributions to the progression of changes evoked by OGD and occurring over 4-5 h. We detected progressive mitochondrial depolarization occurring from ~2 h after ischemia, a large increase in spontaneous synaptic activity between 2 and 3 h, and mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation at 4 h. Blockade of the primary route for Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (with ruthenium red [RR]) or Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation shortly after OGD withdrawal substantially attenuated the mitochondrial depolarization and the changes in synaptic activity. RR also largely reversed the mitochondrial swelling. Finally, using an <I>in vivo</I> rat (male) asphyxial cardiac arrest model of transient global ischemia, we found that ~8 min asphyxia induces considerable injury of CA1 neurons 4 h later that is associated with strong Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within many damaged mitochondria. These effects were substantially attenuated by infusion of RR on reperfusion. Our findings highlight mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation after ischemia as a possible target for neuroprotective therapy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain ischemia is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability that still lacks effective treatment. After transient ischemia, delayed death of neurons occurs in vulnerable brain regions. There is a critical need to understand mechanisms of this delayed neurodegeneration which can be targeted for neuroprotection. We found progressive and long-lasting mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation to occur in highly vulnerable CA1 neurons after ischemia. Here we demonstrate that this Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation contributes strongly to deleterious events occurring after ischemia, including mitochondrial dysfunction, swelling, and structural changes. We suggest that this mitochondrial Zn<sup>2+</sup> entry may constitute a promising target for development of therapeutic interventions to be delivered after termination of an episode of transient global ischemia.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discovering molecular features of intrinsically disordered regions by using evolution for contrastive learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex X. Lu, Amy X. Lu, Iva Pritišanac, Taraneh Zarin, Julie D. Forman-Kay, Alan M. Moses</p>

A major challenge to the characterization of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are widespread in the proteome, but relatively poorly understood, is the identification of molecular features that mediate functions of these regions, such as short motifs, amino acid repeats and physicochemical properties. Here, we introduce a proteome-scale feature discovery approach for IDRs. Our approach, which we call “reverse homology”, exploits the principle that important functional features are conserved over evolution. We use this as a contrastive learning signal for deep learning: given a set of homologous IDRs, the neural network has to correctly choose a held-out homolog from another set of IDRs sampled randomly from the proteome. We pair reverse homology with a simple architecture and standard interpretation techniques, and show that the network learns conserved features of IDRs that can be interpreted as motifs, repeats, or bulk features like charge or amino acid propensities. We also show that our model can be used to produce visualizations of what residues and regions are most important to IDR function, generating hypotheses for uncharacterized IDRs. Our results suggest that feature discovery using unsupervised neural networks is a promising avenue to gain systematic insight into poorly understood protein sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The origin of RNA interference: Adaptive or neutral evolution?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alessandro Torri, Johannes Jaeger, Thomas Pradeu, Maria-Carla Saleh</p>

The origin of RNA interference (RNAi) is usually explained by a defense-based hypothesis, in which RNAi evolved as a defense against transposable elements (TEs) and RNA viruses and was already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). However, since RNA antisense regulation and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are ancient and widespread phenomena, the origin of defensive RNAi should have occurred in parallel with its regulative functions to avoid imbalances in gene regulation. Thus, we propose a neutral evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of RNAi in which qualitative system drift from a prokaryotic antisense RNA (asRNA) gene regulation mechanism leads to the formation of RNAi through constructive neutral evolution (CNE). We argue that RNAi was already present in the ancestor of LECA before the need for a new defense system arose and that its presence helped to shape eukaryotic genomic architecture and stability.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <i>C9orf72</i>. An important neuropathological hallmark associated with this mutation is the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of TAR (trans-activation response element) DNA-binding protein 43 (pTDP-43). Glia plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration observed in <i>C9orf72</i>-associated disorders. However, less is known about the role of oligodendrocytes (OLs). Here, we applied digital neuropathological methods to compare the expression pattern of glial cells in the frontal cortex (FrCx) of human post-mortem samples from patients with C9-FTLD and C9-FTLD/ALS, sporadic FTLD (sFTLD), and healthy controls (HCs). We also compared MBP levels in CSF from an independent clinical FTD cohort. We observed an increase in GFAP, and Iba1 immunoreactivity in C9 and sFTLD compared to controls in the gray matter (GM) of the FrCx. We observed a decrease in MBP immunoreactivity in the GM and white matter (WM) of the FrCx of C9, compared to HC and sFTLD. There was a negative correlation between MBP and pTDP-43 in C9 in the WM of the FrCx. We observed an increase in CSF MBP concentrations in C9 and sFTLD compared to HC. In conclusion, the C9 expansion is associated with myelin loss in the frontal cortex. This loss of MBP may be a result of oligodendroglial dysfunction due to the expansion or the presence of pTDP-43 in OLs. Understanding these biological processes will help to identify specific pathways associated with the <i>C9orf72</i> expansion.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The spinal cord of the tree pangolin is known to be very short compared to the overall length of the body and tail. Here, we provide a description of the tree pangolin spinal cord to determine whether the short length contributes to specific structural, and potentially functional, differences. The short spinal cord of the adult tree pangolin, at around 13 cm, terminates at the midthoracic level. Within this shortened spinal cord, we could identify six regions, which from rostral to caudal include the prebrachial, brachial, interramal, crural, postcrural, and caudal regions, with both the brachial and crural regions showing distinct swellings. The chemoarchitecture of coronal sections through these regions confirmed regional assignation, being most readily delineated by the presence of cholinergic neurons forming the intermediolateral column in the interramal region and the sacral parasympathetic nucleus in the postcrural region. The 10 laminae of Rexed were observed throughout the spinal cord and presented with an anatomical organization similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the shortened length of the tree pangolin spinal cord, the regional and laminar anatomical organization is very similar to that observed in other mammals. This indicates that the functional aspects of the short tree pangolin spinal cord can be inferred from what is known in other mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mechanistic contribution of CaV3.2 calcium channels to trigeminal neuralgia pathophysiology not clarified [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a rare, yet debilitating trigeminal pain disorder, with jolts of supramaximal-debilitating pain in one or more of the three trigeminal branches. Familial TN is now recognized, with a recent report describing several human genetic polymorphisms. One affected gene is the voltage-gated calcium channel, CaV3.2 (CACNA1H), with 19 polymorphisms first described. A recent study in PAIN by Gambeta-et-al (DOI:10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002651) is entitled "CaV3.2 calcium channels contribute to trigeminal neuralgia ". Here, I call into question their claim. My main arguments are 1)-3):  1) Gambeta-et-al studied 4/19 mutations reported in heterologous cellular expression, with two mutations showing gain-of-function of CaV3.2, two mutations not showing gain-of-function. Therefore the exemplary picks of familial TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations do not show a uniform change of channel function, such as gain-of-function.  2) In Gambeta-et-al, one gain-of-function mutation, CaV3.2(G563R) was directed to mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and their resulting hyperexcitability was demonstrated. A critical control of a non-gain-of-function channel was not included here, it was unclear whether neurons were separated by sex, and human sensory neurons were not used. Importantly, it is not clear that TG  neurons are the critical cellular site of CaV3.2 mutations. 3) Gambeta-et-al used CaV3.2-/- pan-null knockout mice. Human TN-associated CaV3.2 mutations were not over-expressed. They used a infraorbital nerve constriction injury and measured facial heat hyperalgesia.  CaV3.2-/- show a pain phenotype similar to control, yet are not affected by a CaV3-inhibitory compound, Z944. My argument is that when starting with TN-associated human mutations, use of a trigeminal neuropathic pain model is of limited value, and that human mutations have to be expressed against a mouse null background. Re thermal cue, Gambeta-et-al failed to study cold-evoked pain which is a TN clinical hallmark. Thus, Gambeta-et-al's 2022 PAIN-paper offers little new mechanistic evidence why CaV3.2 polymorphisms are associated with trigeminal neuralgia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of a peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Frequent positional changes and movements during labour is one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent prolonged labour, thereby avoiding cesarean sections. However, labour induction, continuous fetal monitoring in supine position and immobilising the women during labour are standard practices in most private hospitals. To combat these problems and to implement WHO recommendations, the peanut ball is an effective device through which frequent positional changes will be achieved without disrupting the labour procedures. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes and assess the stress response induced by labour in terms of maternal and neonatal cortisol in low-risk primigravid women. The study is a prospective, block randomised controlled trial with parallel arms. A total of 768 study participants will be randomised to the peanut-ball group (intervention) and standard care group (control). The intervention group will receive different peanut ball positions during labour at or after 4 cm of cervical dilatation. The primary outcomes of the study are maternal outcome that includes measurement of duration of the active and the second stage of labour, stress level as measured by serum cortisol level at 3–4 cm and at 10 cm of cervical dilatation, mode of delivery, perception of pain, behavioural response during the active stage of labour and neonatal outcomes, which includes the pattern of fetal heart rate, APGAR score, birth injuries, and umbilical serum and salivary cortisol level. The collected data will be compared between the intervention and control groups.  Trial Registration: This research is registered under the CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry of India) (CTRI/2019/08/020802) (21/8/2019).

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rehabilitation top-down techniques based on brain stimulation present variable outcomes in unilateral spatial neglect (USN) after stroke. This study aimed to examine the effects of physical therapy after anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS and C-tDCS, respectively) to improve visuospatial and functional impairments in individuals with USN after stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This double-blinded, pilot randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with USN after ischemic stroke. Randomization was stratified according to the Behavior Inattention Test–Conventional (BIT-C) and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS). Outpatient physical therapy was conducted for 7.5 weeks after 20 minutes of tDCS. The primary outcome was the USN degree evaluated by the BIT-C. Secondary outcomes were the difference in CBS score, stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]), disability (modified Rankin Scale), autonomy (Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure), and quality of life (EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire). Outcomes were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model corrected by age, baseline NIHSS, and baseline BIT-C. Pairwise post hoc comparisons were performed using Bonferroni correction.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the primary outcomes, A-tDCS led to greater improvement in BIT-C after intervention (mean difference [MD] = 18.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9–32.8, <i>p</i> = 0.008) compared to sham. However, no significant differences were observed between A-tDCS and C-tDCS (MD = 13.9, 95% CI = −0.3 to 28.1, <i>p</i> = 0.057), or C-tDCS and sham (MD = 4.5, 95% CI = −9.7 to 18.8, <i>p</i> = 0.99). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of secondary outcomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A-tDCS associated with physical therapy can decrease the severity of USN after stroke. However, these preliminary findings must be confirmed by collecting additional evidence in a larger phase 3 trial. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Magnetoencephalography with optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG): the next generation of functional neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures human brain function via assessment of the magnetic fields generated by electrical activity in neurons. Despite providing high-quality spatiotemporal maps of electrophysiological activity, current MEG instrumentation is limited by cumbersome field sensing technologies, resulting in major barriers to utility. Here, we review a new generation of MEG technology that is beginning to lift many of these barriers. By exploiting quantum sensors, known as optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), ‘OPM-MEG’ has the potential to dramatically outperform the current state of the art, promising enhanced data quality (better sensitivity and spatial resolution), adaptability to any head size/shape (from babies to adults), motion robustness (participants can move freely during scanning), and a less complex imaging platform (without reliance on cryogenics).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DIP2 is a unique regulator of diacylglycerol lipid homeostasis in eukaryotes</a></h4>

              
                Chain-length specific subsets of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipids are proposed to regulate differential physiological responses ranging from signal transduction to modulation of the membrane properties. However, the mechanism or molecular players regulating the subsets of DAG species remains unknown. Here, we uncover the role of a conserved eukaryotic protein family, DISCO-interacting protein 2 (DIP2) as a homeostatic regulator of a chemically distinct subset of DAGs using yeast, fly and mouse models. Genetic and chemical screens along with lipidomics analysis in yeast reveal that DIP2 prevents the toxic accumulation of specific DAGs in the logarithmic growth phase, which otherwise leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress. We also show that the fatty acyl-AMP ligase-like domains of DIP2 are essential for the redirection of the flux of DAG subspecies to storage lipid, triacylglycerols. DIP2 is associated with vacuoles through mitochondria-vacuole contact sites and such modulation of selective DAG abundance by DIP2 is found to be crucial for optimal vacuole membrane fusion and consequently osmoadaptation in yeast. Thus, the study illuminates an unprecedented DAG metabolism route and provides new insights on how cell fine-tunes DAG subspecies for cellular homeostasis and environmental adaptation.

                Mutations in the lever arm of β-cardiac myosin are a frequent cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease characterized by hypercontractility and eventual hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Here, we studied five such mutations: three in the pliant region of the lever arm (D778V, L781P, and S782N) and two in the light chain-binding region (A797T and F834L). We investigated their effects on both motor function and myosin subfragment 2 (S2) tail-based autoinhibition. The pliant region mutations had varying effects on the motor function of a myosin construct lacking the S2 tail: overall, D778V increased power output, L781P reduced power output, and S782N had little effect on power output, while all three reduced the external force sensitivity of the actin detachment rate. With a myosin containing the motor domain and the proximal S2 tail, the pliant region mutations also attenuated autoinhibition in the presence of filamentous actin but had no impact in the absence of actin. By contrast, the light chain-binding region mutations had little effect on motor activity but produced marked reductions in autoinhibition in both the presence and absence of actin. Thus, mutations in the lever arm of β-cardiac myosin have divergent allosteric effects on myosin function, depending on whether they are in the pliant or light chain-binding regions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">­­­Connectomic analysis of the Drosophila lateral neuron clock cells reveals the synaptic basis of functional pacemaker classes</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock orchestrates daily changes in physiology and behavior to ensure internal temporal order and optimal timing across the day. In animals, a central brain clock coordinates circadian rhythms throughout the body and is characterized by a remarkable robustness that depends on synaptic connections between constituent neurons. The clock neuron network of <i>Drosophila</i>, which shares network motifs with clock networks in the mammalian brain yet is built of many fewer neurons, offers a powerful model for understanding the network properties of circadian timekeeping. Here we report an assessment of synaptic connectivity within a clock network, focusing on the critical lateral neuron (LN) clock neuron classes within the Janelia hemibrain dataset. Our results reveal that previously identified anatomical and functional subclasses of LNs represent distinct connectomic types. Moreover, we identify a small number of non-clock cell subtypes representing highly synaptically coupled nodes within the clock neuron network. This suggests that neurons lacking molecular timekeeping likely play integral roles within the circadian timekeeping network. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive connectomic analysis of a circadian neuronal network.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Waveform detection by deep learning reveals multi-area spindles that are selectively modulated by memory load</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is generally considered to be a state of large-scale synchrony across thalamus and neocortex; however, recent work has challenged this idea by reporting isolated sleep rhythms such as slow oscillations and spindles. What is the spatial scale of sleep rhythms? To answer this question, we adapted deep learning algorithms initially developed for detecting earthquakes and gravitational waves in high-noise settings for analysis of neural recordings in sleep. We then studied sleep spindles in non-human primate electrocorticography (ECoG), human electroencephalogram (EEG), and clinical intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings in the human. Within each recording type, we find widespread spindles occur much more frequently than previously reported. We then analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of these large-scale, multi-area spindles and, in the EEG recordings, how spindle patterns change following a visual memory task. Our results reveal a potential role for widespread, multi-area spindles in consolidation of memories in networks widely distributed across primate cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Triple dissociation of visual, auditory and motor processing in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortices respond to crossmodal stimuli, for example auditory responses are found in primary visual cortex (V1). However, it remains unclear whether these responses reflect sensory inputs or behavioural modulation through sound-evoked body movement. We address this controversy by showing that sound-evoked activity in V1 of awake mice can be dissociated into auditory and behavioural components with distinct spatiotemporal profiles. The auditory component began at ~27 ms, was found in superficial and deep layers and originated from auditory cortex, as shown by inactivation by muscimol. Sound-evoked orofacial movements correlated with V1 neural activity starting at ~80-100 ms and explained auditory frequency-tuning. Visual, auditory and motor activity were expressed by segregated neuronal populations and during simultaneous audiovisual stimulation, visual representations remained dissociable from auditory and motor-related activity. This threefold dissociability of auditory, motor and visual processing is central to understanding how distinct inputs to visual cortex interact to support vision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ZO1 scaffold isoforms differentially contribute to electrical synapse formation</a></h4>

              
                Electrical synapses are neuronal gap junction channels associated with a macromolecular complex called the electrical synapse density (ESD), which regulates development and dynamically modifies electrical transmission. However, the molecular mechanisms of ESD formation are not well understood. Using the Mauthner cell of zebrafish as a model, we previously found that the intracellular scaffolding protein ZO1 is a member of the ESD, localizing postsynaptically, where it is required for channel localization, electrical communication, neural network function, and behavior (Lasseigne et al., 2021). Here, we show that the complexity of the ESD is further diversified by the genomic structure of the ZO1 gene locus. The ZO1 gene is alternatively initiated at three transcriptional start sites resulting in isoforms with unique N-termini that we call ZO1b-Alpha, -Beta, and -Gamma. We demonstrate that ZO1b-Beta is localized to electrical synapses where it is necessary and sufficient for robust channel localization. By contrast, ZO1b-Gamma is localized to synapses yet plays a minor role in electrical synapse formation. This study expands the notion of molecular complexity at the ESD, revealing that an individual genomic locus can contribute multiple independent isoforms that differentially contributing to electrical synaptogenesis. We propose that ESD complexity, at the level of the proteome, but also in the diversity of individual protein isoforms, will have critical impacts on the structure, function, and plasticity of electrical transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cytoarchitectonic, receptor distribution and functional connectivity analyses of the macaque frontal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Based on quantitative cyto- and receptor architectonic analyses, we identified 35 prefrontal areas and introduced a novel subdivision of Walker's areas 10, 9, 8B and 46. Statistical analysis of receptor densities revealed regional differences in lateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Since structural and functional organization of subdivisions encompassing areas 46 and 12 demonstrated significant differences in the interareal levels of alpha-2 receptors. Furthermore, multivariate analysis included receptor fingerprints of previously identified 16 motor areas in the same macaque brains, and revealed five clusters encompassing frontal lobe areas. Based on the functional connectivity analysis, clustered areas showed similar connectivity distribution pattern. In particular, rostrally located areas (in clusters 1-2) were characterized by bigger fingerprints, i.e., higher receptor densities, and stronger regional interconnections. Whereas, more caudal areas (in clusters 3-5) had smaller fingerprints, but showed a widespread connectivity pattern with distant cortical regions. Taken together, present study provides a comprehensive insight into the molecular structure underlying the functional organization of the cortex and, thus, reconcile discrepancies between the structural and functional hierarchical organization of the primate frontal lobe. Finally, our data are publicly available via the EBRAINS and BALSA repositories for the entire scientific community.

                Hypothalamic vasopressin neurons are neuroendocrine cells which form part of the homeostatic systems that maintain osmotic pressure. In response to synaptic inputs encoding osmotic pressure and changes in plasma volume, they generate spike triggered secretion of peptide hormone vasopressin from axonal terminals in the posterior pituitary. The thousands of neurons' secretory signals generate a summed plasma vasopressin signal acting at the kidneys to regulate water loss. Vasopressin is synthesised in cell bodies, packaged into vesicles, and transported to large stores in the pituitary terminals. Supported by activity-dependent upregulation of synthesis and transport, these stores can maintain a secretion response for several days of elevated osmotic pressure, tested by dehydration or salt loading. However, despite upregulated synthesis, stores gradually decline during sustained challenge, followed by a slow recovery. With no evidence of a store encoding feedback signal, previous modelling explained these synthesis dynamics based on activity-dependent upregulation of transcription and mRNA content. Here this model is adapted and integrated into our existing spiking and secretion model to generate a neuronal population model, able to simulate the secretion, store depletion, and replenishment, response to sustained osmotic challenge, matching the dynamics observed experimentally and making functional predictions for the cell body mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Granger causality analysis for calcium transients in neuronal networks: challenges and improvements</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand how information flows between neurons, triggering specific behaviour. At large scales, Granger causality (GC) has been proposed as a simple and effective measure for identifying dynamical interactions. At single-cell resolution however, GC analysis is rarely used compared to directionless correlation analysis. We discuss here the applicability of Granger Causality analysis for population calcium imaging data. We used recordings from motoneurons in the zebrafish embryo and the entire brainstem region of zebrafish larvae during active visuomotor behavior, and synthetic data simulating intracellular calcium fluctuations of spiking neurons in a chosen neuronal network. We first show that despite underlying linearity assumptions, GC analysis can successfully retrieve non-linear interactions in a synthetic network. We then discuss the potential pitfalls and challenges when applying GC analysis on population calcium imaging data, including the effects of calcium signal preprocessing and motion artefacts. We show how to optimize the choice of GC analysis parameters, such as the relevant time delay and the GC value significance threshold to account for the properties of the data. Applied to motoneuron and hindbrain datasets from larval zebrafish, we show how the improved GG better reflects information flow between neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the similarities of representations in artificial and brain neural networks for speech recognition</a></h4>

              
                How the human brain supports speech comprehension is an important question in neuroscience. Studying the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying human language is not only critical to understand and develop treatments for many human conditions that impair language and communication but also to inform artificial systems that aim to automatically process and identify natural speech. In recent years, intelligent machines powered by deep learning have achieved near human level of performance in speech recognition. The fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience have finally reached a similar phenotypical level despite of their huge differences in implementation, and so deep learning models can---in principle---serve as candidates for mechanistic models of the human auditory system. Utilizing high-performance automatic speech recognition systems, and advanced noninvasive human neuroimaging technology such as magnetoencephalography and multivariate pattern-information analysis, the current study aimed to relate machine-learned representations of speech to recorded human brain representations of the same speech. In one direction, we found a quasi-hierarchical functional organisation in human auditory cortex qualitatively matched with the hidden layers of deep neural networks trained in an automatic speech recognizer. In the reverse direction, we modified the hidden layer organization of the artificial neural network based on neural activation patterns in human brains. The result was a substantial improvement in word recognition accuracy and learned speech representations. We have demonstrated that artificial and brain neural networks can be mutually informative in the domain of speech recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Angular speed should be avoided when assessing the speed-curvature power law of movement</a></h4>

              
                The speed-curvature power law is an intriguing constraint between the geometry and the kinematics of a movement trajectory. It dictates, for instance, how much slower the hand should move in curves. The empirical phenomenon has led to various interesting theoretical proposals for its origin and possible generating processes. Its formulation based on tangential speed (V~kC{beta}) is considered equivalent to its angular speed counterpart (A~kC{beta}+1), with the corresponding change in the exponent. In the case of drawing ellipses, these relationships are known as the "one-third power law" or the "two-thirds power law", respectively, after the values of the exponents. Here we show that using angular speed instead of tangential speed tends to result in much stronger data correlations, impacting on the interpretation of the strength of the relationship, the putative value of the exponents, and even the very existence of the power law. We explain how and why this is the case, using both empirical and synthetic data. We conclude that angular speed should be avoided when expressing the speed-curvature power law.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear CREB1: what does it mean?</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian pineal gland (PG), cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) participates in the nocturnal melatonin synthesis that rhythmically modulates physiology and behavior. Phosphorylation of CREB1 present in pinealocyte nuclei is one of the key regulatory steps that drives pineal transcription. The spatio-temporal dynamics of CREB1 itself within PG cell types have not yet been documented. In this study we analyzed total CREB1 via Western blot, and the dynamism of CREB1 nuclear distribution in individual rat pinealocytes using fluorescence immunohistochemistry followed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and quantitative analysis. Total CREB1 levels remained constant in the PG throughout the light:dark cycle. The distribution pattern of nuclear CREB1 did vary, however, among different PG cells. Pinealocytes emerged as having discrete CREB1 domains within their nucleoplasm that were especially distinct. The number, size, and location of CREB1 foci fluctuated among pinealocytes, within the same PG and among Zeitgeber times. A significantly larger dispersion of CREB1-immunoreactive nuclear sites was found at night. This was not accompanied by changes in the overall transcription activity, which was mostly conserved between the light and dark phases, as shown by the expression of a particular phosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII-pSer5CTD). Suppression of the nocturnal norepinephrine pulse by chronic bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy increased CREB1 dispersion in pinealocyte nuclei, as compared to sham-derived cells. In addition, differences in CREB1 distribution were found between sham-operated and non-operated rats at early night. Together, these data suggest that in mature pinealocytes nuclear CREB1 is subjected to a dynamic spatio-temporal distribution. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, including the role of chromatin and interchromatin elements, and to understand the impact of CREB1 reorganization in the pineal transcriptome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A global method of generating action potentials and EEG oscillations in a topological surface network Model Predictions and Speculations</a></h4>

              
                In this paper we complete a project to demonstrates that both action potential like and EEG waveform like brain excitations can be viewed as excitations generated by exploiting the topological connectivity properties of the brain, thereby relating function to form. This is done by first proving that it is possible to find a two dimensional mathematical surface network that exactly captures the topological architecture of any hypothetical brain connectome. It is then suggested that such a surface can be taken to be a mathematical representation of the brain if it is charged and if it has surface spin half particles as then it can be shown that the surface can generate a variety of one dimensional action potential like soliton voltage pulse signals and co-producing two dimension surface EEG like waveforms in responds to local surface pinch deformations input signals. The charged soliton pulses found are shown to carry details of the input signals deformation parameters that create them and can transfer this information to the pathways they traverse as a helical non transient topologically stable alignment of surface spins: a memory substrate. The substrate has a natural, theoretically determined, excitation frequency that can be used to retrieve memories by resonance. In an earlier work soliton pulse generation and memory creation stability issues were discussed. Here we show how EEG like excitations are co-produced and establish their properties. We determine the analytic expressions, of EEG waveforms, determine their frequencies, show that frequencies are inversely relate to the waveform amplitudes, and related to symmetric tiling of a sphere and show how they are modulated by other signals. As an example we describe how the scheme can be used to explain the complex sequence of EEG excitations observed in deep sleep. We speculate on how action potentials and EEG waveforms cooperate to retrieve memory and help to focus attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Brain Signal Complexity Predicts Human Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous brain activity builds the foundation for human cognitive processing during external demands. A huge number of neuroimaging studies identified specific characteristics of spontaneous (intrinsic) brain dynamics to be associated with individual differences in general cognitive ability, i.e., intelligence. However, respective research is inherently limited by low temporal resolution, thus, preventing conclusions about neural fluctuations within the range of milliseconds. Here, we used resting-state electroencephalographical (EEG) recordings from 144 healthy adults to test whether individual differences in intelligence (Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices scores) can be predicted from the complexity of temporally highly resolved intrinsic brain signals. We compared different operationalizations of brain signal complexity (multiscale entropy, Shannon entropy, Fuzzy entropy, and specific characteristics of microstates) in regard to their relation to intelligence. The results indicate that associations between brain signal complexity measures and intelligence are of small effect sizes (r ~ .20) and vary across different spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, higher intelligence scores were associated with lower complexity in local aspects of neural processing, and less activity in task-negative brain regions belonging to the default-mode network. Finally, we combined multiple measures of brain signal complexity to show that individual intelligence scores can be significantly predicted with a multimodal model within the sample (10-fold cross-validation) as well as in an independent sample (external replication, N = 57). In sum, our results highlight the temporal and spatial dependency of associations between intelligence and intrinsic brain dynamics, proposing multimodal approaches as promising means for future neuroscientific research on complex human traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurocomputational mechanisms underlying fear-biased adaptation learning in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                Humans are able to adapt to the fast-changing world by estimating statistical regularities of the environment. Although fear can profoundly impact adaptive behaviors, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we conducted a behavioral experiment (n = 21) and a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n = 37) with a novel cue-biased adaptation learning task, during which we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence (fearful/neutral expressions of the cue) and environmental volatility (frequent/infrequent reversals of reward probabilities). Across two experiments, computational modelling consistently revealed a higher learning rate for the environment with frequent versus infrequent reversals following neutral cues. In contrast, this flexible adjustment was absent in the environment with fearful cues, suggesting a suppressive role of fear in adaptation to environmental volatility. This suppressive effect was underpinned by activity of the posterior parietal cortex, ventral striatum, hippocampus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as well as increased functional connectivity between the dACC and temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) for fear with environmental volatility. Dynamic causal modelling identified that the driving effect was located in the TPJ and was associated with dACC activation, suggesting that the suppression of fear on adaptive behaviors occurs at the early stage of bottom-up processing. These findings provide a neuro-computational account of how fear interferes with adaptation to volatility during dynamic environments.

                Intrinsic neural timescales (INT) reflect the duration for which brain areas store information. A posterior anterior hierarchy of increasingly longer INT has been revealed in both typically developed individuals (TD), as well as patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ), though INT are, overall, shorter in both patient groups. In the present study, we attempted to replicate previously reported group differences by comparing INT of TD to ASD and SZ. We replicated the previously reported result showing reduced INT in the left lateral occipital gyrus and the right post-central gyrus in SZ compared to TD. For the first time, we also directly compared the INT of the two patient groups and found that these same two areas show significantly reduced INT in SZ compared to ASD. In ASD, significant correlations were found between INT and their clinical and phenotypic characteristics. Our results point to the left lateral occipital gyrus and the right post-central gyrus as holding potential for further diagnostic refinement of SZ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal Population Encoding of Identity in Primate Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) is consistently active during the perception of faces and voices. However, little is known about what categorical features of social stimuli drive neural activity in this region. Since perception of identity and expression are critical social functions, we examined whether neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were driven by these two categorial features in the prefrontal cortex. We recorded single neurons in the VLPFC, while two macaques viewed short audiovisual videos of unfamiliar conspecifics making expressions of aggressive, affiliative, and neutral valence. Of the 285 neurons responsive to the audiovisual stimuli, 111 neurons had a main effect (two-way ANOVA) of identity, expression or their interaction in their stimulus related firing rates; however, decoding of expression and identity using single unit firing rates rendered poor accuracy. Interestingly, when decoding from pseudopopulations of recorded neurons, the accuracy for both expression and identity increased with population size, suggesting that the population transmitted information relevant to both variables. Principal components analysis of mean population activity across time revealed that population responses to the same identity followed similar trajectories in the response space, facilitating segregation from other identities. Our results suggest that identity is a critical feature of social stimuli that dictates the structure of population activity in the VLPFC, during the perception of vocalizations and their corresponding facial expressions. These findings enhance our understanding of social behavior beyond the temporal lobe in macaques and humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Position representations of moving objects align with real-time position in the early visual response</a></h4>

              
                When localising a moving object, the brain receives outdated sensory information about its position, due to the time required for neural transmission and processing. The brain may overcome these fundamental delays through predictively encoding the position of moving objects using information from their past trajectories. In the present study, we evaluated this proposition using multivariate analysis of high temporal resolution electroencephalographic data. We tracked neural position representations of moving objects at different stages of visual processing, relative to the real-time position of the object. During early stimulus-evoked activity, position representations of moving objects were activated substantially earlier than the equivalent activity evoked by unpredictable flashes, aligning the earliest representations of moving stimuli with their real-time positions. These findings indicate that the predictability of straight trajectories enables full compensation for the neural delays accumulated early in stimulus processing, but that delays still accumulate across later stages of cortical processing.

                Upon trauma, the adult murine PNS displays a remarkable degree of spontaneous anatomical and functional regeneration. To explore extrinsic mechanisms of neural repair, we carried out single cell analysis of naive mouse sciatic nerve, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and crushed sciatic nerves at 1-day, 3-days, and 7- days following injury. During the first week, monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mac) rapidly accumulate in the injured nerve and undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory Mo/Mac in the injured nerve show high glycolytic flux compared to Mo/Mac in blood and dominate the early injury response. They subsequently give way to inflammation resolving Mac, programmed toward oxidative phosphorylation. Nerve crush injury causes partial leakiness of the blood-nerve-barrier, proliferation of endoneurial and perineurial stromal cells, and accumulation of select serum proteins. Micro-dissection of the nerve injury site and distal nerve, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, identified distinct immune compartments, triggered by mechanical nerve wounding and Wallerian degeneration, respectively. This finding was independently confirmed with Sarm1-/- mice, where Wallerian degeneration is greatly delayed. Experiments with chimeric mice showed that wildtype immune cells readily enter the injury site in Sarm1-/- mice, but are sparse in the distal nerve, except for Mo. We used CellChat to explore intercellular communications in the naive and injured PNS and report on hundreds of ligand-receptor interactions. Our longitudinal analysis represents a new resource for nerve regeneration, reveals location specific immune microenvironments, and reports on large intercellular communication networks. To facilitate mining of scRNAseq datasets, we generated the injured sciatic nerve atlas (iSNAT): https://cdb-rshiny.med.umich.edu/Giger_iSNAT/

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech intelligibility changes the temporal evolution of neural speech tracking</a></h4>

              
                Listening to speech with poor signal quality is challenging. Neural speech tracking of degraded speech has been used to advance the understanding of how brain processes and speech intelligibility are interrelated, however the temporal dynamics of neural speech tracking are not clear. In the present MEG study, we thereby exploited temporal response functions (TRFs) and generated signal-degraded speech to depict the temporal evolution of speech intelligibility modulation on neural speech tracking. In addition, we inter-related facets of neural speech tracking (e.g., speech envelope reconstruction, speech-brain coherence, and components of broadband coherence spectra) to endorse our findings in TRFs. Our TRF analysis yielded marked temporally differential effects of vocoding: reduction of intelligibility went along with large increases of early peak responses (~50-110 ms, M50TRF), but strongly reduced responses around 175-230 ms (M200TRF). For the late responses 315-380 ms (M350TRF), the maximum response occurred for degraded speech that was still comprehensible then declined with reduced intelligibility. Furthermore, we related the TRF components to our other neural tracking measures and found that M50TRF and M200TRF play a differential role in the shifting center frequency of the broadband coherence spectra. Overall, our study highlights the importance of time-resolved computation and parametrization of coherence spectra on neural speech tracking and provides a better understanding of degraded speech processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic reduction of theta oscillations reveals that a single reliable time cell sequence is not required for working memory</a></h4>

              
                In a delayed alternation spatial working memory task, hippocampal time cells fire during specific moments of the delay period to form a stable, sequential representation of the entire delay interval. The causal relationship between these sequences and working memory remains unclear. Similarly, hippocampal theta oscillations are thought to support working memory, primarily through the generation of time cell sequences. To causally examine these relationships, we optogenetically silenced the medial septal GABAergic theta-generating circuit during the delay portion of a delayed spatial alternation task. Without hippocampal theta oscillations, many time cells exhibited remapping, new time cells were recruited, and time cell information was increased; collectively resulting in a new time cell sequence during the delay period. Despite this remapping of time cells on random selection of theta-reduced trials, behavioral performance was unimpaired, demonstrating that working memory is not dependent on a single or unique time cell sequence during the delay period.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Superior colliculus visual neural sensitivity at the lower limit of natural self-induced image displacements</a></h4>

              
                Visual pattern analysis relies on computations from neurons possessing spatially confined receptive fields. Often, such receptive fields are orders of magnitude larger than the visual pattern components being processed, as well as these components' minute displacements on the retina, whether due to small object or self motions. Yet, perception effortlessly handles such visual conditions. Here, we show that in the primate superior colliculus, a brain structure long associated with oculomotor control, neurons with relatively large receptive fields are still sensitive to visual pattern displacements as small as 1 min arc. We used real-time gaze-contingent retinal image stabilization to control the instantaneous spatio-temporal luminance modulation of detailed patterns experienced by neurons, probing sensitivity to the lower limit of natural self-induced image displacements. Despite a large difference between pattern displacement amplitudes and receptive field sizes, collicular neurons were strongly sensitive to the visual pattern consequences of the smallest possible eye movements.

	<p>Background: Diagnosis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) based on clinical symptoms and scale scores is mostly objective, and the accuracy of neuroimaging for PD diagnosis remains controversial. This study aims to introduce a radiomic tool to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) metrics. Methods: In this machine learning-based retrospective study, we collected basic clinical information and DTI images from 54 healthy controls (HCs) and 56 PD patients. Among them, 60 subjects (30 PD patients and 30 HCs) were assigned to the training group, whereas the test cohort was 26 PD patients and 24 HCs. After the feature extraction and selection using newly developed image processing software Ray-plus, LASSO regression was used to finalize radiomic features. Results: A total of 4600 radiomic features were extracted, of which 12 were finally selected. The values of the AUC (area under the subject operating curve) in the training group, the validation group, and overall were 0.911, 0.931, and 0.919, respectively. Conclusion: This study introduced a novel radiometric and computer algorithm based on DTI images, which can help increase the sensitivity and specificity of PD screening.</p>

	<p>Background: This study aims to establish the key clinical features of different motoric cognitive risk (MCR) subtypes based on individual quantitative measures of cognitive impairment and to compare their predictive power on survival over an 8-year observation time. Methods: We analyzed data from a population-based study of 1138 subjects aged 65 years and older in south Italy. These individuals were targeted and allocated to subtypes of the MCR phenotype according to the slowness criterion plus one other different cognitive domain for each characterized phenotype (Subjective Cognitive Complaint [SCC]; Global Function [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) &amp;amp;lt; 24]; or a combination of both). Clinical evaluation and laboratory assays, along with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological and physical tests, completed the sample investigation. Results: MCR prevalence was found to be 9.8% (n = 112), 3.6% (n = 41), 3.4% (n = 39) and 1.8% (n = 21) for the MCR, MCR-GlobalFunction, MCR-StructuredSCC and MCR-SCC and GlobalFunction, respectively. Univariate Cox survival analysis showed an association only of the MCR-GlobalFunction subtype with an almost three-fold increased risk of overall death as compared to the other counterparts (HR 2.53, 95%CI 1.28 to 4.99) over an 8-year observation period. Using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) for clustered survival data, we found that MCR males had an increased and significant mortality risk with respect to MCR female subjects. Conclusions: MCR phenotypes assigned to the MMSE cognitive domain are more likely to have an increased risk of overall mortality, and gender showed a huge effect on the risk of death for MCR subjects over the 8-year observation.</p>

	<p>Attention is a particularly important indicator in life, as inattention can lead to many negative consequences. As a non-invasive intervention, real-time neurofeedback training can effectively enhance individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; attention adjustment abilities. However, previous studies have neglected to consider differences among individuals. In this study, an individualized neurofeedback training (INT) method based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was proposed for attention improvement and compared with non-individualized neurofeedback training (NINT). The neurofeedback channels and thresholds were determined individually for each subject. Then, participants conducted four runs of neurofeedback training. Two attention tests (i.e., AX version of continuous performance task (AX-CPT) and attention network test (ANT)) were used to assess the performance of the neurofeedback training. The length of time that the two groups of participants continuously kept their oxygenated hemoglobin concentration above a threshold showed an increasing trend, and the improvement rate of the INT group was higher than that of the NINT group. The reaction times for both groups showed a downward trend, but the INT group declined more significantly. In the fNIRS data, it was observed that the activation degree of the INT group in the middle and dorsolateral prefrontal areas was higher than that of the NINT group. It is preliminarily proved that the proposed INT method can effectively improve the attention level, and its overall performance is better than that of the NINT method.</p>

	<p>Background: Studies on cerebral palsy among children and adolescents in Arabic-speaking countries are scarce. In this systematic review, we aimed to describe the epidemiology of cerebral palsy among children and adolescents in Arabic-speaking countries in terms of prevalence, risk factors, motor types, and rehabilitation. Methods: Six key bibliographic databases were searched for relevant literature published to 17 July 2021. Titles and abstracts were screened for potential inclusion and two independent reviewers screened the full texts of potential articles following pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. The included studies were evaluated independently by three reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted and analysed. Results: A total of 32 studies from 7 countries met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of cerebral palsy in Arabic-speaking countries was 1.8/1000 live births (95% CI: 1.2&amp;amp;ndash;2.5). Spastic cerebral palsy was the most common motor type, representing 59.8% (95% CI: 46.2&amp;amp;ndash;72.7) of pooled estimates. This included children with spastic quadriplegia, diplegia, and hemiplegia; 25.1% (95% CI: 18.2&amp;amp;ndash;32.8), 16.2% (95% CI: 11.4&amp;amp;ndash;23.3), and 10.4% (95% CI: 7.3&amp;amp;ndash;13.8), respectively. Consanguinity was high and represented 37.7% (95% CI: 29.3&amp;amp;ndash;46.6). Only one included study reported the types of rehabilitation received (e.g., physiotherapy and assistance devices). Conclusions: This paper provides a summary of the epidemiology of cerebral palsy in Arabic-speaking countries and highlights areas for future research. There is still a substantial knowledge gap on the epidemiology of cerebral palsy in these regions. Countries in the Arab region should follow examples of countries that have successfully established cerebral palsy registries to generate evidence on epidemiology of cerebral palsy and opportunities for prevention.</p>

	<p>The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus is a key component of the stress circuitry of the brain. During stress, the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is secreted onto LC, increasing LC output and norepinephrine concentration in the brain, which is thought to promote anxiety-like behavior. LC is also innervated by several structures that synthesize and release the endogenous opioid peptide enkephalin onto LC upon stressor termination. While the role of CRF neurotransmission within LC in mediating anxiety-like behavior and the behavioral response to stress has been well characterized, the role of enkephalinergic signaling at LC-expressed &amp;amp;delta;-opioid receptors has been comparatively understudied. We have previously shown that acute stressor exposure increases LC activity and anxiety-like behavior for at least one week. Here, we extend these findings by showing that these effects may be mediated at least in part through stress-induced downregulation of DORs within LC. Furthermore, overexpression of DORs in LC blocks the effects of stress on both LC firing properties and anxiety-like behavior. In addition, intra-LC infusions of enkephalin blocked stress-induced freezing behavior and promoted conditioned place preference. These findings indicate that enkephalinergic neurotransmission at DORs within LC is an important component of the behavioral response to stress and may drive reward-related behavior as well.</p>

	<p>Functional abnormalities in brain areas within the fronto-limbic network have been widely reported in obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD). However, region- and network-level brain activities of the fronto-limbic network at rest have not been simultaneously investigated in OCD. In this study, 40 medicine-free and non-comorbidity patients with OCD and 38 age-, education-, and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent a resting-state functional magnetic-resonance-imaging scan. Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), network homogeneity (NH), and support vector machine were used to analyze the data. Patients with OCD showed increased fALFF in the right orbital frontal cortex (OFC), increased NH in the left OFC, and decreased NH in the right putamen. Decreased NH of the right putamen was negatively correlated with the Y-BOCS total and compulsive behavior scores. Furthermore, a combination of NH in the left OFC and right putamen could be applied to differentiate OCD from HCs with optimum specificity and sensitivity. The current findings emphasize the crucial role of the fronto-limbic network in the etiology of OCD.</p>

	<p>Intravenous thrombolysis is the most commonly used drug therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke, which is often accompanied by complications of intracerebral hemorrhage transformation (HT). This study proposed to build a reliable model for pretreatment prediction of HT. Specifically, 5400 radiomics features were extracted from 20 regions of interest (ROIs) of multiparametric MRI images of 71 patients. Furthermore, a minimal set of all-relevant features were selected by LASSO from all ROIs and used to build a radiomics model through the random forest (RF). To explore the significance of normal ROIs, we built a model only based on abnormal ROIs. In addition, a model combining clinical factors and radiomics features was further built. Finally, the models were tested on an independent validation cohort. The radiomics model with 14 All-ROIs features achieved pretreatment prediction of HT (AUC = 0.871, accuracy = 0.848), which significantly outperformed the model with only 14 Abnormal-ROIs features (AUC = 0.831, accuracy = 0.818). Besides, combining clinical factors with radiomics features further benefited the prediction performance (AUC = 0.911, accuracy = 0.894). So, we think that the combined model can greatly assist doctors in diagnosis. Furthermore, we find that even if there were no lesions in the normal ROIs, they also provide characteristic information for the prediction of HT.</p>

	<p>Are non-native speakers able to process their second language in a native-like way? The present study used the Event-Related Potentials&amp;amp;rsquo; (ERPs) method to address this issue by focusing (1) on agent vs. agentless intransitive sentences and (2) on person vs. number agreement morphology. For that purpose, native and high proficiency and early non-native speakers of Spanish were tested while processing intransitive sentences containing grammatical and ungrammatical subject&amp;amp;ndash;verb agreement. Results reveal greater accuracy in the agent (unergative) condition as compared with the agentless (unaccusative) condition and different ERP patterns for both types of verbs in all participants, suggesting a larger processing cost for the agentless sentences than for the agentive ones. These effects were more pronounced in the native group as compared with the non-native one in the early time window (300&amp;amp;ndash;500 ms). Differences between person and number agreement processing were also found at both behavioral and electrophysiological levels, indicating that those morphological features are distinctively processed. Importantly, this pattern of results held for both native and non-native speakers, thus suggesting that native-like competence is attainable given early Age of Acquisition (AoA), frequent use and high proficiency.</p>

	<p>Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) affects a child&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to learn motor skills. Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is one of the recommended treatments to help achieve functional motor goals. The purpose of this study was to determine if CO-OP intervention induces functional improvements and structural changes in the cerebellum of children with DCD. Using a randomized waitlist-controlled trial, we investigated the effects of CO-OP intervention on cerebellar volume in 47 children with DCD (8&amp;amp;ndash;12 years old). Outcome measures included the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS), and Bruininks&amp;amp;ndash;Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2. The SUIT toolbox was used to carry out voxel-based morphometry using T1-weighted MRI scans. Children with DCD showed improved motor outcomes and increased gray matter volume in the brainstem, right crus II, bilateral lobules VIIIb, and left lobule IX following CO-OP. Significant associations were found between PQRS scores and regional gray matter changes in the brainstem, right crus II, right lobule VIIb, right and left lobule VIIIb, and vermis IX. Given the improved motor and brain outcomes with CO-OP, it is recommended that children with DCD be referred for this rehabilitation intervention.</p>

	<p>Objective: To investigate the intervention effect of orienteering exercises on the spatial memory ability of college students of different genders and its underlying mechanism. Methods: Forty-eight college students were randomly screened into experimental and control groups, 12 each of male and female, by SBSOD scale. The effects of 12 weeks of orienteering exercises on the behavioral performance and brain activation patterns during the spatial memory tasks of college students of different genders were explored by behavioral tests and the fNIRS technique. Results: After the orienteering exercise intervention in the experimental group, the male students had significantly greater correct rates and significantly lower reaction times than the female students; left and right dorsolateral prefrontal activation was significantly reduced in the experimental group, and the male students had a significantly greater reduction in the left dorsolateral prefrontal than the female students. The degree of activation in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontals of the male students and the right dorsolateral prefrontals of the female students correlated significantly with behavioral performance, and the functional coupling between the brain regions showed an enhanced performance. Discussion: Orienteering exercises improve the spatial memory ability of college students, more significantly in male students. The degree of activation of different brain regions correlated with behavioral performance and showed some gender differences.</p>

	<p>Attachment theory provides a conceptual framework to understand the impact of early child&amp;amp;ndash;caregiver experiences, such as loss or separation, on adult functioning and psychopathology. In the current study, scenes from the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), a validated, commonly used standardized diagnostic instrument to assess adult attachment representations, were used to develop a short fMRI assay eliciting the neural correlates of encoding of potentially hurtful and threatening social situations such as social losses, rejections or loneliness. Data from healthy participants (N = 19) showed activations in brain areas associated with social cognition and semantic knowledge during exposure to attachment-related scenes compared to control scenes. Extensive activation of the temporal poles was observed, suggesting the use of semantic knowledge for generating social concepts and scripts. This knowledge may underlie our ability to explain and predict social interactions, a specific aspect of theory of mind or mentalization. In this replication study, we verified the effectiveness of a modified fMRI assay to assess the external validity of a previously used imaging paradigm to investigate the processing of emotionally negatively valenced and painful social interactions. Our data confirm the recruitment of brain areas associated with social cognition with our very short neuroimaging assay.</p>

	<p>Goal: It is challenging to clinically discern the severity of neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) within hours after birth in time for therapeutic decision-making for hypothermia. The goal of this study was to determine the shortest duration of the EEG based PAC index to provide real-time guidance for clinical decision-making for neonates with HIE. Methods: Neonates were recruited from a single-center Level III NICU between 2017 and 2019. A time-dependent, PAC-frequency-averaged index, tPACm, was calculated to characterize intrinsic coupling between the amplitudes of 12&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz and the phases of 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 Hz oscillation from 6-h EEG data at electrode P3 during the first day of life, using different sizes of moving windows including 10 s, 20 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to examine the performance of the accurate window tPACm as a neurophysiologic biomarker. Results: A total of 33 neonates (mild-HIE, n = 15 and moderate/severe HIE, n = 18) were enrolled. Mixed effects models demonstrated that tPACm between the two groups was significantly different with window time segments of 3&amp;amp;ndash;120 min. By observing the estimates of group differences in tPACm across different window sizes, we found 20 min was the shortest window size to optimally distinguish the two groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Time-varying ROC showed significant average area-under-the-curve of 0.82. Conclusion: We demonstrated the feasibility of using tPACm with a 20min EEG time window to differentiate the severity of HIE and facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation.</p>

<p>Graphical Abstract: Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, we comprehensively mapped oxytocin receptor mRNA throughout the prairie vole brain. A comparison of mRNA and protein localization revealed localized mismatches suggesting both pre- and postsynaptic functions for oxytocin receptors (OXTRs). Coexpression of Oxtr mRNA with D1/D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens was also examined.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxytocin regulates social behavior via direct modulation of neurons, regulation of neural network activity, and interaction with other neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral effects of oxytocin signaling are determined by the species-specific distribution of brain oxytocin receptors. The socially monogamous prairie vole has been a useful model organism for elucidating the role of oxytocin in social behaviors, including pair bonding, response to social loss, and consoling. However, there has been no comprehensive mapping of oxytocin receptor-expressing cells throughout the prairie vole brain. Here, we employed a highly sensitive in situ hybridization, RNAscope, to construct an exhaustive, brain-wide map of oxytocin receptor mRNA-expressing cells. We found that oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was widespread and diffused throughout the brain, with specific areas displaying a particularly robust expression. Comparing receptor binding with mRNA revealed that regions of the hippocampus and substantia nigra contained oxytocin receptor protein but lacked mRNA, indicating that oxytocin receptors can be transported to distal neuronal processes, consistent with presynaptic oxytocin receptor functions. In the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in oxytocin-dependent social bonding, oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was detected in both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing subtypes of cells. Furthermore, natural genetic polymorphisms robustly influenced oxytocin receptor expression in both D1 and D2 receptor cell types in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, our findings further elucidate the extent to which oxytocin signaling is capable of influencing brain-wide neural activity, responses to social stimuli, and social behavior.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with strong expression concentrated in certain areas involved in social behavior.</p>
<p>Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression and protein localization are misaligned in some areas, indicating that the receptor protein may be transported to distal processes.</p>
<p>In the nucleus accumbens, oxytocin receptors are expressed on cells expressing both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, and the majority of variation in oxytocin receptor expression between animals is attributable to polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Optoception: Perception of Optogenetic Brain Perturbations</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>How do animals experience brain manipulations? Optogenetics has allowed us to manipulate selectively and interrogate neural circuits underlying brain function in health and disease. However, little is known about whether mice can detect and learn from arbitrary optogenetic perturbations from a wide range of brain regions to guide behavior. To address this issue, mice were trained to report optogenetic brain perturbations to obtain rewards and avoid punishments. Here, we found that mice can perceive optogenetic manipulations regardless of the perturbed brain area, rewarding effects, or the stimulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic cell types. We named this phenomenon optoception, a perceptible signal internally generated from perturbing the brain, as occurs with interoception. Using optoception, mice can learn to execute two different sets of instructions based on the laser frequency. Importantly, optoception can occur either activating or silencing a single cell type. Moreover, stimulation of two brain regions in a single mouse uncovered that the optoception induced by one brain region does not necessarily transfer to a second not previously stimulated area, suggesting a different sensation is experienced from each site. After learning, they can indistinctly use randomly interleaved perturbations from both brain regions to guide behavior. Collectively taken, our findings revealed that mice&rsquo;s brains could "monitor" perturbations of their self-activity, albeit indirectly, perhaps via interoception or as a discriminative stimulus, opening a new way to introduce information to the brain and control brain-computer interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Readiness and determinants of Vietnam's general public to receive the COVID-19 Vaccine: a national online cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite vaccinations' efficacy in combating disease, people's readiness to get the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine are substantially varied. This study aimed to assess Vietnamese people's readiness, attitudes, and determinants for COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a convenience sampling approach. The Vietnamese population's readiness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations was assessed using the 7C of vaccination readiness scale (7Cs). The scale was posted on Facebook and Zalo platforms. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and inferential analysis was applied to identify determinants predicting respondents' vaccine readiness. Results: Of the 1086 respondents invited to the study, 1026 completed the questionnaire. The Vietnamese population demonstrated a moderate level of readiness for COVID-19 vaccination uptake, with an average 7Cs score of 103.25±15.13. A high level was underscored in the complacency, constraints, collective responsibility, and compliance components, and a low level was reported in the calculation component. The Vietnamese population emphasized that the awareness of the significant adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination was the primary factor influencing their readiness to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Worrying about the vaccine manufacturer and its origin was the second most crucial factor influencing their readiness to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Building confidence between people and the Vietnamese authorities is a high priority to enhance people's readiness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The authorities should focus on dispelling disinformation posted on social media and promoting the usefulness of COVID-19 vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Search engine optimisation (SEO) strategy as determinants to enhance the online brand positioning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Marketers face evolution of online brand positioning marketing strategy due to changes of search engine algorithm that affects the reaching out of brands to potential internet users. Brand owners realise that to be relevant in modern market, they need to transition and focus more into online market. However, many brand owners have ignored the power of search engine optimisation (SEO) strategy for attracting the online market, which is highly competitive and faces rapid changes.  A brand can be considered as old fashioned if it does not utilise the SEO as their marketing strategy, in penetrating the online marketplace. Various studies have analysed factors that can enhance the persistency of using the SEO strategy, however gaps remain regarding the relationship of this strategy with the online brand positioning. The main aim of this study was to identify the persistency of using the SEO strategy including the niche point of differentiation, valuable content, targeted keyword and scalable link building, as the determinants that enhance the success of online brand positioning. Methods – This study applies quantitative design using online survey to gather information from the online business entrepreneurs. The survey questionnaire was arranged to focus on the use of SEO as a new way to strategies online business. Results – Based on the results of this study, most online entrepreneurs have somewhat realised the effects of using the SEO strategy to enhance effectiveness of online brand positioning. Conclusion – This research provides insights on the importance of SEO strategy in online business positioning. It is hoped that the online entrepreneurs will take the SEO strategy into consideration in the positioning of their brand in the marketplace.

                Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 was first documented in Indonesia in 2017. It has become prevalent in chickens in many provinces of Indonesia as a result of reassortment in live bird markets. Low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H9N2 virus-infected poultry provides a new direction for the influenza virus. According to the latest research, the Indonesian H9N2 viruses may have developed through antigenic drift into a new genotype, posing a significant hazard to poultry and public health. The latest proof of interspecies transmission proposes that the next human pandemic variant will be the avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. Manipulation and elimination of H9N2 viruses in Indonesia, constant surveillance of viral mutation, and vaccine updates are required to achieve effectiveness. The current review examines should be investigates/assesses/report on the development and evolution of newly identified H9N2 viruses in Indonesia and their vaccination strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID19 vaccination choice among Iraqi students at Al-Zahraa University for women [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  COVID19 vaccine rejection is a global issue that most developing countries face. A study of COVID-19 vaccine preference among Al-Zahraa University female students will pave the way to resolving the issue of vaccine rejection among students. Vaccine hesitation refers to a delay in accepting or refusing immunization despite the fact that vaccination services are readily available. Students' preferences and refusals of the COVID19 vaccine were evaluated to determine the reasons for their decisions.  Methods: This study involved 198 students from Al-Zahraa University for women. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Zahraa University in Karbala, Iraq, to find out which Health and Medical Technology students preferred the COVID19 vaccine. Tests based on statistics made use of frequency and rate data.  Results: Most students (95%) were over the age of 19. The COVID-19 vaccine was rejected by 138 people (70.4%).  A total of 43 students (28.5%) believed that the COVID19 vaccine may not be completely safe. 49.3% of students were not aware of the differences between the various types of vaccines.  Pfizer was the most preferred by 64 (34.8%), AstraZeneca by 17 (9.2%), and Chinse-Sinovac by only 11 (6%). 20 students (16.4%) believed that with the vaccine they could return to life as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Covid-19 vaccine acceptance among Al-Zahara University students may be low in part because of myths, and partly because of the fear of side-effects associated with the vaccine.  Conclusion:  Information about COVID-19 vaccines should be transparently communicated to the media by health authorities to help the public make informed decisions.

                <p>by Brett L. Foster, Eleonora Bartoli</p>

New findings in PLOS Biology show that visual gamma oscillations are greatly attenuated by small spatial discontinuities in visual stimuli, suggesting that their genesis occurs in response to predictable regularities in the visual world.

This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study showing that gamma synchrony in visual cortex is disrupted when small discontinuities are added to visual stimuli. This suggests that gamma synchrony is highly sensitive to regularities in the visual world and potentially play a role in predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DEVEA: an interactive shiny application for Differential Expression analysis, data Visualization and Enrichment Analysis of transcriptomics data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We are at a time of considerable growth in the use and development of transcriptomics studies and subsequent in silico analysis. RNA sequencing is one of the most widely used approaches, now integrated in many studies.  The processing of these data may typically require a noteworthy number of steps, statistical knowledge, and coding skills which is not accessible to all scientists. Despite the undeniable development of software applications over the years to address this concern, it is still possible to improve.  Here we present DEVEA, an R shiny application tool developed to perform differential expression analysis, data visualization and enrichment pathway analysis mainly from transcriptomics data, but also from simpler gene lists with or without statistical values.  Its intuitive and easy-to-manipulate interface facilitates gene expression exploration through numerous interactive figures and tables, statistical comparisons of expression profile levels between groups and further meta-analysis such as enrichment analysis, without bioinformatics expertise. DEVEA performs a thorough analysis from multiple and flexible input data representing distinct analysis stages. From them, it produces dynamic graphs and tables, to explore the expression levels and statistical differential expression analysis results. Moreover, it generates a comprehensive pathway analysis to extend biological insights. Finally, a complete and customizable HTML report can be extracted for further result exploration outside the application. DEVEA is accessible at https://shiny.imib.es/devea/ and the source code is available on our GitHub repository https://github.com/MiriamRiquelmeP/DEVEA.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis: to investigate the association of adherence to plant-based diets with cardiovascular disease risk [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:Plant-based diets (PBDs) are characterised as healthy dietary patterns that emphasise the intake of plant foods and limit the intake of animal foods. The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are common examples of healthy dietary patterns that are mainly plant based. There are different dietary pattern analysis approaches and scoring systems available to construct indices that measure adherence to a dietary pattern. Nutritional epidemiology studies necessitate the use of appropriate dietary indices when investigating diet-disease associations. This protocol is for a review that will: 1) evaluate how a PBD has been defined in studies published globally; and 2) assess the methods used to construct dietary indices that measure adherence to a PBD; with a focus on studies that have assessed the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. Methods:This protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines. PubMed–Medline, Scopus and biomedical databases within EBSCOhost will be searched up to August 2021. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified records and review the eligible full texts for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or through discussion with a third reviewer. Meta-analysis will be performed where possible and consistency of the findings checked through subgroup analysis. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed and quantified, and publication bias investigated. Relevant sensitivity analyses will be performed to substantiate the robustness of the study findings. Conclusion:Currently, there is some inconsistency in defining and measuring adherence to a PBD across study populations. Moreover, a lack of global data on the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. This systematic review could aid in promoting the worldwide uptake of these findings for policy and practice purposes. This research will use previously published studies; and therefore, will not require ethical approval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Intrapartum care intervention fidelity and factors associated with it in South Wollo Administrative Zone, Northeast Ethiopia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background: Implementation of recommended intrapartum care intervention varies across places due to contextual socio-cultural and behavioral determinants. Previous research has utilized several operationalizations to measure intrapartum intervention content and has failed to analyze provider and facility-related factors that influence intrapartum intervention content. So yet, no study has used intervention fidelity metrics to assess intrapartum care. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing institutional intrapartum care intervention fidelity & factors associated with it. Methods: On randomly selected keabeles (study sites), a cross-sectional study design was used. All health posts and health extension workers within the specified area were included, as were 898 postnatal mothers within six months of delivery. Data was collected via an interview, self-administered questionnaires, and an observation checklist. To calculate the institutional delivery coverage and intrapartum care intervention fidelity, descriptive statistics were used. The weighted sum of all intrapartum care components and institutional delivery coverage were used to calculate intrapartum care intervention fidelity. The researchers utilized a multilevel linear regression analysis model to find characteristics linked to intrapartum care intervention fidelity. Results: In this study, institutional delivery coverage was 60.9% (95% CI: 57.7 – 64.1) with intrapartum care intervention fidelity of 35.6% (95% CI: 31.3-35.9). Moreover, only 21 (2.3%) of mothers received all of the contents of intrapartum care intervention. Health posts’ distance from mothers’ home, unskilled birth attendant, poor relationship between HEWs and HC staffs and low HEWs knowledge of danger signs were statistically significant barriers while HEWs as birth attendant were facilitators for Intrapartum care intervention fidelity. Conclusion: This study investigated that intrapartum care intervention fidelity was low. This finding indicated that distance from health institution inhibit mothers to receive skilled intrapartum care interventions as recommended.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Overlapping transcriptional programs promote survival and axonal regeneration of injured retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Several interventions promote survival and regeneration of retinal ganglion cells following injury. scRNA-seq analysis shows that these interventions downregulate a gene expression program associated with cell death and upregulate programs associated with survival and regeneration. Overexpression of some regeneration module genes enhances RGC survival and axon regeneration in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stable antibiotic resistance and rapid human adaptation in livestock-associated MRSA</a></h4>

              
                Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, but can also be vertically inherited by daughter cells. Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here, we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn<i>916</i> transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCC<i>mec</i> that carries methicillin, tetracycline, and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCC<i>mec</i>. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398 have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CAMSAP2 organizes a γ-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation centre through phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are dynamic polymers consisting of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The initial polymerization process, called microtubule nucleation, occurs spontaneously via αβ-tubulin. Since a large energy barrier prevents microtubule nucleation in cells, the γ-tubulin ring complex is recruited to the centrosome to overcome the nucleation barrier. However, a considerable number of microtubules can polymerize independently of the centrosome in various cell types. Here, we present evidence that the minus-end-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) serves as a strong nucleator for microtubule formation by significantly reducing the nucleation barrier. CAMSAP2 co-condensates with αβ-tubulin via a phase separation process, producing plenty of nucleation intermediates. Microtubules then radiate from the co-condensates, resulting in aster-like structure formation. CAMSAP2 localizes at the co-condensates and decorates the radiating microtubule lattices to some extent. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that CAMSAP2 supports microtubule nucleation and growth by organizing a nucleation centre as well as by stabilizing microtubule intermediates and growing microtubules.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robotic search for optimal cell culture in regenerative medicine</a></h4>

              
                Induced differentiation is one of the most experience- and skill-dependent experimental processes in regenerative medicine, and establishing optimal conditions often takes years. We developed a robotic AI system with a batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that autonomously induces the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (iPSC-RPE) cells. From 200 million possible parameter combinations, the system performed cell culture in 143 different conditions in 111 days, resulting in 88% better iPSC-RPE production than that obtained by the pre-optimized culture in terms of the pigmentation scores. Our work demonstrates that the use of autonomous robotic AI systems drastically accelerates systematic and unbiased exploration of experimental search space, suggesting immense use in medicine and research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Domain fusion TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of Staphylococcus aureus in the genetic engineering goat</a></h4>

              
                <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control <i>S. aureus</i> infections due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote <i>S. aureus</i> clearance via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing <i>S. aureus</i>, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goat expressing <i>TLR2-4</i> is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of <i>S. aureus</i> within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2 promote LC3-puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during <i>S. aureus</i>-induced autophagy via MyD88 mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after <i>S. aureus</i> challenge. Moreover, the transcript of <i>ATG5</i> and <i>ATG12</i> is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling, which facilitates <i>S. aureus</i>-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of <i>S. aureus</i> in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN, and cAMP-PKA-NF-κB-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach for resistant against <i>S. aureus</i> infection.

                Whereas no known living vertebrate possesses gills derived from the jaw-forming mandibular arch, it has been proposed that the jaw arose through modifications of an ancestral mandibular gill. Here, we show that the zebrafish pseudobranch, which regulates blood pressure in the eye, develops from mandibular arch mesenchyme and first pouch epithelia and shares gene expression, enhancer utilization, and developmental <i>gata3</i> dependence with the gills. Combined with work in chondrichthyans, our findings in a teleost fish point to the presence of a mandibular pseudobranch with serial homology to gills in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, consistent with a gill origin of vertebrate jaws.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Antibacterial potency of Type VI amidase effector toxins is dependent on substrate topology and cellular context</a></h4>

              
                Members of the bacterial T6SS amidase effector (Tae) superfamily of toxins are delivered between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a high-throughput <i>in vivo</i> genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of <i>tae1</i> toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.

                Most rapid diagnostic tests for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria target the Histidine-Rich Proteins 2 and 3 (HRP2, HRP3)<i>.</i> Deletions of the <i>hrp2</i> and <i>hrp3</i> genes result in false negative tests and are a threat for malaria control. A novel assay for molecular surveillance of <i>hrp2</i>/<i>hrp3</i> deletions was developed based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The assay quantifies <i>hrp2</i>, <i>hrp3</i>, and a control gene with very high accuracy. The theoretical limit of detection was 0.33 parasites/µL. The deletion was reliably detected in mixed infections with wild-type and <i>hrp2</i>-deleted parasites at a density of &gt;100 parasites/reaction. For a side-by-side comparison with the conventional nested PCR (nPCR) assay, 248 samples were screened in triplicate by ddPCR and nPCR. No deletions were observed by ddPCR, while by nPCR <i>hrp2</i> deletion was observed in 8% of samples. The ddPCR assay was applied to screen 830 samples from Kenya, Zanzibar/Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Brazil, and Ecuador. Pronounced differences in the prevalence of deletions were observed among sites, with more <i>hrp3</i> than <i>hrp2</i> deletions. In conclusion, the novel ddPCR assay minimizes the risk of false-negative results (i.e. <i>hrp2</i> deletion observed when the sample is wild type), increases sensitivity, and greatly reduces the number of reactions that need to be run.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Understanding drivers of phylogenetic clustering and terminal branch lengths distribution in epidemics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Detecting factors associated with transmission is important to understand disease epidemics, and to design effective public health measures. Clustering and terminal branch lengths (TBL) analyses are commonly applied to genomic data sets of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) to identify sub-populations with increased transmission. Here, I used a simulation-based approach to investigate what epidemiological processes influence the results of clustering and TBL analyses, and whether differences in transmission can be detected with these methods. I simulated MTB epidemics with different dynamics (latency, infectious period, transmission rate, basic reproductive number R0, sampling proportion, sampling period, and molecular clock), and found that all considered factors, except for the length of the infectious period, affect the results of clustering and TBL distributions. I show that standard interpretations of this type of analyses ignore two main caveats: (1) clustering results and TBL depend on many factors that have nothing to do with transmission, (2) clustering results and TBL do not tell anything about whether the epidemic is stable, growing, or shrinking, unless all the additional parameters that influence these metrics are known, or assumed identical between sub-populations. An important consequence is that the optimal SNP threshold for clustering depends on the epidemiological conditions, and that sub-populations with different epidemiological characteristics should not be analyzed with the same threshold. Finally, these results suggest that different clustering rates and TBL distributions, that are found consistently between different MTB lineages, are probably due to intrinsic bacterial factors, and do not indicate necessarily differences in transmission or evolutionary success.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aberrant cortical development is driven by impaired cell cycle and translational control in a DDX3X syndrome model</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the RNA helicase, <i>DDX3X</i>, are a leading cause of Intellectual Disability and present as <i>DDX3X</i> syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with cortical malformations and autism. Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of <i>Ddx3x</i> loss-of-function we demonstrate that DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is sensitive to <i>Ddx3x</i> dosage; complete <i>Ddx3x</i> loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, <i>Ddx3x</i> loss is sexually dimorphic, as its paralog, <i>Ddx3y</i>, compensates for <i>Ddx3x</i> in the developing male neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling <i>in vivo</i> to discover the repertoire of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new insights into the etiology of <i>DDX3X</i> syndrome, implicating dysregulated progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.

                Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Despite substantial research efforts, the physiological and pathological role of this multidomain protein remains poorly defined. In this study, we used a systematic approach to construct the general protein-protein interactome around LRRK2, which was then differentiated into 15 tissue-specific interactomes taking into consideration the differential expression patterns and the co-expression behaviours of the LRRK2 interactors in different healthy tissues. The LRRK2 interactors exhibited distinct expression features in the brain as compared to the peripheral tissues analysed. Moreover, a high degree of similarity was found for the LRRK2 interactors in putamen, caudate and nucleus accumbens, thus defining a potential LRRK2 functional cluster within the striatum. We also explored the functions highlighted by the "core LRRK2 interactors" within each tissue and illustrated how the LRRK2 interactomes can be used as a tool to trace the relationship between LRRK2 and specific interactors of interest, here exemplified with a study focused on the LRRK2 interactors belonging to the Rab protein family.

                We propose that in order to harness our understanding of neuroscience toward machine learning, we must first have powerful tools for training brain-like models of learning. Although substantial progress has been made toward understanding the dynamics of learning in the brain, neuroscience-derived models of learning have yet to demonstrate the same performance capabilities as methods in deep learning such as gradient descent. Inspired by the successes of machine learning using gradient descent, we demonstrate that models of neuromodulated synaptic plasticity from neuroscience can be trained in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a framework of learning to learn through gradient descent to address challenging online learning problems. This framework opens a new path toward developing neuroscience inspired online learning algorithms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reinstatement of emotional associations during human sleep: an intracranial EEG study</a></h4>

              
                The scientific literature suggests that emotional memories benefit from a privileged consolidation over neutral memories. This effect extends to consolidation processes that occur during sleep. Indeed, during sleep, a complex set of oscillations (namely slow-oscillations, theta rhythm and spindles) mediates the communication between brain regions involved in the long-term integration of memories. However, whether sleep oscillations may contribute to the reactivation and consolidation of emotional memories in humans is still unclear. Because non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has limited access to deep brain regions implicated in memory and emotion (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex), here we recorded EEG signal from these brain regions using intracranial electrodes placed in medically-resistant epileptic patients in the context of presurgical investigation. During wakefulness, we presented the patients with emotional (i.e., humorous) vs emotionally neutral pictures paired with a sound. Then, we tested for the reinstatement of emotional-associations by delivering the sound during a subsequent period of sleep. We found that the reactivation of emotional (compared to neutral) memories during sleep enhanced slow-oscillation and spindle activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, paralleled with an increase in theta connectivity between the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, we observed that the theta response to emotional memories reactivated at subsequent wake was different than for neutral memories, suggesting a change in memory traces with targeted memory reactivation. These data suggest that consolidation of emotional events during sleep is due to a larger expression of sleep features (in the slow-oscillation, theta and sigma frequency bands) and that the mechanisms of brain plasticity also take place in emotional brain regions during NREM sleep.

                Cognitive neuroscience posits that humans perform physical inferences using mental simulations. Here, we test this hypothesis by analyzing neural activity in the monkeys' frontal cortex in a ball interception task. We find a low-dimensional neural embedding of the ball position that tracks the ball both when it is visible and invisible. This embedding may serve as a neural substrate for mental simulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel preparation of the entire isolated CNS unveils the modulatory influences of supra-pontine structures on brainstem and spinal networks.</a></h4>

              
                Several spinal motor output and essential rhythmic behaviors are controlled by supraspinal structures. Although of great advantage in deciphering their functional organization, existing preparations of the isolated brainstem and spinal networks only focus on local circuitry. The goal of our study has been to better characterize the contribution of higher centers to the neuronal networks involved in respiration and locomotion. Thus, a novel in vitro preparation from the isolated CNS of neonatal rodents was introduced to simultaneously record a stable respiratory rhythm from both cervical and lumbar ventral roots (VRs). Selective electrical pulses supplied to the pons and medulla evoked distinct VR responses in rostrocaudal direction with a staggered onset, while stimulation of ventrolateral medulla resulted in higher events from homolateral VRs. Moreover, electrical stimulation of a lumbar dorsal root (DR) elicited responses even from cervical VRs, albeit small and delayed, confirming functional ascending pathways. Furthermore, prototypical fictive locomotion was induced by trains of pulses applied to either the ventrolateral medulla or a DR. By progressively removing higher centers, duration of respiratory burst was reduced after a precollicular decerebration, which also affected the area of lumbar DR and VR potentials elicited by DR stimulation while frequency of respiration increased after a following pontobulbar transection. Keeping legs attached to the CNS allows for expressing the respiratory rhythm during peripheral stimulation of limbs. The study demonstrates that supra-pontine centers regulate the spontaneous respiratory rhythm, as well as electrically-evoked reflexes and spinal network activity. Thus, the current approach contributes to clarifying the modulatory influence of the brain on the brainstem and spinal micro-circuits.
