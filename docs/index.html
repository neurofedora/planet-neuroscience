              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unexpected inhibition of motor function by dopamine activation of D1/D2 co-expressing striatal neurons.</a></h4>

              
                The central function of the striatum and its dopaminergic (DA) afference in motor control and integration of cognitive and emotional processes is commonly explained by the two striatal efferent pathways characterized by striatal projection neurons (SPNs) expressing DA D1 receptor- and D2 receptor (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs), respectively, regardless of SPNs co-expressing these two receptors (D1/D2-SPNs). Here, after developing an approach that enables to target these hybrid SPNs, we demonstrated that, although these SPNs are rare, they play a major role in guiding the motor function of the other two main populations and convey a DA-mediated antagonistic motor brake. D1/D2-SPNs project exclusively to the external globus pallidus (GPe) and have specific electrophysiological features with distinctive integration of DA signals. Optogenetic stimulation and loss-of-function experiments indicated that D1/D2-SPNs potentiate the prokinetic and antikinetic functions of D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs, respectively, and restrain the integrated motor response to psychostimulants. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of this third unacknowledged population of D1/D2 co-expressing neurons, which orchestrates the fine-tuning of DA regulation in the thalamo-cortico-striatal loops.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Language Comprehension During Saccadic Eye Movements: An Investigation Using the N400 Event-Related Brain Potential</a></h4>

              
                In many situations of everyday life, it is important to quickly understand a spoken message despite distraction by an already ongoing activity. Previous dual-task studies recording the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) have shown that auditory language comprehension can be strongly delayed by temporally overlapping additional tasks. In the current study, we investigated whether this interference is aggravated by the need for saccadic eye movements and visuospatial attention shifts in the overlapping task. In two dual-task experiments, a synonymy judgment task for spoken words was combined with a visual discrimination task at different stimulus onset asynchronies. In half of the trials, the primary visual task required a 10 degree exogenous saccade towards a peripheral stimulus. The timing of semantic processing in the secondary task was assessed by recording the N400. We replicated that with increasing temporal overlap between the tasks, the N400 component was strongly delayed. However, additional saccade-related processes in the primary task had no detrimental effects on concurrent spoken language processing on their own. Unexpectedly, we also observed that a preceding saccade consistently facilitated subsequent motoric processing in the visual task (as indexed by manual reaction times and the lateralized readiness potential), suggesting that saccade execution as such can significantly enhance subsequent processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A visual representation of the hand in the resting somatomotor regions of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Hands are regularly in sight in everyday life. This visibility affects motor control, perception, and attention, as visual information is integrated into an internal model of sensorimotor control. Spontaneous brain activity, i.e., ongoing activity in the absence of an active task (rest), is correlated among somatomotor regions that are jointly activated during motor tasks1. Moreover, recent studies suggest that spontaneous activity patterns do not only replay at rest task activation patterns, but also maintain a model of the statistical regularities (priors) of the body and environment, which may be used to predict upcoming behavior (Raichle et al,2011; Betti et al, 2021; Pezzulo, 2021). Here we test whether spontaneous activity in the human somatomotor cortex is modulated by visual stimuli that display hands vs. non-hand stimuli, and by the use/action they represent. We analyzed activity with fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to examine the similarity between spontaneous (rest) activity patterns and task-evoked patterns to the presentation of natural hands, robot hands, gloves, or control stimuli (food). In the left somatomotor cortex we observed a stronger (multi-voxel) spatial correlation between resting-state activity and natural hand picture patterns, as compared to other stimuli. A trend analysis showed that task-rest pattern similarity was influenced by inferred visual and motor attributes (i.e., correlation for hand>robot>glove>food). We did not observe any task-rest similarity in the visual cortex. We conclude that somatomotor brain regions code at rest for visual representations of hand stimuli and their inferred use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signalling speed along a key white matter tract influences memory recall ability in humans</a></h4>

              
                Conduction velocity is the speed at which electrical signals travel along axons and is a crucial determinant of neural communication. Inferences about conduction velocity can now be made in vivo in humans using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and a measure called the MR g-ratio. Here, in the first application to cognition, we found that increased MR g-ratio, and by inference faster conduction velocity, specifically in the parahippocampal cingulum bundle, which connects the hippocampus with a range of other brain areas, was associated with better memory recall ability in 217 healthy adults. Moreover, two tract features seemed to favour better memory retrieval - large inner axon diameters and coherently organised neurites, both of which facilitate speedy signalling. These results offer a new perspective on drivers of individual differences in memory recall ability. More broadly, they show that MR g-ratio can provide novel insights into how the human brain processes and integrates information.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Lasting Effects of Activating BDNF-Expressing PVH Neurons on Energy Balance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are implicit in causing obesity. Mutations that reduce BDNF and TrkB expression are associated with obesity in humans and mice. Recently, it was reported that <I>Bdnf</I> gene deletion in the neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) caused positive energy balance and severe obesity in the form of hyperphagia, impaired adaptive thermogenesis, and decreased energy expenditure. Thus, we hypothesize that activation of these neurons will have the opposite effect and provide an opportunity for long-lasting obesity treatment. To specifically activate BDNF-expressing PVH (PVH<sup>BDNF</sup>) neurons, we injected Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq bilaterally into the PVH of <I>Bdnf<sup>2A-Cre/+</sup></I> knock-in mice and then administered clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Using this technique, we demonstrated that acute activation of these neurons rapidly decreased normal nocturnal feeding and fasting-induced feeding in male and female mice. At thermoneutral temperatures, acute activation also rapidly increased adaptive thermogenesis, increased core body temperature, increased locomotion, increased energy expenditure, and decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in male and female mice. These observations indicate that acute stimulation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance and weight loss. However, the rapid decrease in RER after activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons was followed by a delayed and prolonged increase in RER that remained elevated for 3 d in female mice. Thus, although acute activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance in the short term, long-term effects of activation include sexually dimorphic overcompensatory mechanisms that may promote positive energy balance in female mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Egr1 Is Necessary for Forebrain Dopaminergic Signaling during Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Finding the link between behaviors and their regulatory molecular pathways is a major obstacle in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. The immediate early gene (IEG) <I>EGR1</I> is implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and is linked to gene pathways associated with social behavior. Despite extensive knowledge of <I>EGR1</I> gene regulation at the molecular level, it remains unclear how EGR1 deficits might affect the social component of these disorders. Here, we examined the social behavior of zebrafish with a mutation in the homologous gene <I>egr1</I>. Mutant fish exhibited reduced social approach and orienting, whereas other sensorimotor behaviors were unaffected. On a molecular level, expression of the dopaminergic biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), was strongly decreased in TH-positive neurons of the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus. These neurons are connected with basal forebrain (BF) neurons associated with social behavior. Chemogenetic ablation of around 30% of TH-positive neurons in this preoptic region reduced social attraction to a similar extent as the <I>egr1</I> mutation. These results demonstrate the requirement of Egr1 and dopamine signaling during social interactions, and identify novel circuitry underlying this behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">P3b Does Not Reflect Perceived Contrasts</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It has been shown that P3b is not a signature of perceptual awareness per se but is instead more closely associated with postperceptual processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Cohen et al., 2020</cross-ref>). Here, we seek to investigate whether human participants&rsquo; attentional states are different in the report and the no-report conditions. This difference in attentional states, if exists, may lead to degraded consciousness of the stimuli in the no-report condition, and it therefore remains unknown whether the disappearance of P3b is because of a lack of reportability or degraded consciousness. Results of our experiment 1 showed that participants did experience degraded contents of consciousness in the no-report condition. However, results of experiment 2 showed that the degraded contents of consciousness did <I>not</I> influence the amplitude of P3b. These findings strengthen the claim that P3b is <I>not</I> a signature of perceptual awareness but is associated with postperceptual processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deconstructing Synaptotagmin-1's Distinct Roles in Synaptic Vesicle Priming and Neurotransmitter Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) is a synaptic vesicle resident protein that interacts via its C2 domain with anionic lipids from the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner to efficiently trigger rapid neurotransmitter (NT) release. In addition, SYT1 acts as a negative regulator of spontaneous NT release and regulates synaptic vesicle (SV) priming. How these functions relate to each other mechanistically and what role other synaptotagmin (SYT) isoforms play in supporting and complementing the role of SYT1 is still under intensive investigation. In this work, we analyzed three putative functions of SYT1 in exocytosis by systematically varying its expression in autaptic hippocampal glutamatergic neurons from mice of either sex. We find that regulation of release probability is most sensitive to variation of expression levels, whereas its impact on vesicle priming is least sensitive. Also, loss of SYT1 phenotypes on spontaneous release and vesicle priming is compensated in less mature synaptic cultures by redundant support from SYT7. Overall, our data help in resolving some controversies in SYT1 functions in exocytosis and in our understanding of how SYT1 contributes to the pathophysiology underlying SYT1-related human neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work clarifies the functions of SYT1 protein in synaptic vesicle priming and spontaneous and calcium-evoked neurotransmitter release and analyzes whether these occur at different stages of synaptic responses by examining their relative sensitivity to protein concentration at the synaptic terminal. We demonstrate that these synaptic functions are unequally sensitive to both protein levels and neuronal stage, indicating that they operate under distinct molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we analyze how these functions are modulated by another synaptotagmin isoform expression. We show that to understand the phenotype displayed by SYT1 knock-out neurons (<I>Syt1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) is necessary to consider the interplay between SYT1 and SYT7 molecules at the presynaptic terminal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activation of Extrasynaptic Kainate Receptors Drives Hilar Mossy Cell Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mossy cells (MCs) of the dentate gyrus are key components of an excitatory associative circuit established by reciprocal connections with dentate granule cells (GCs). MCs are implicated in place field encoding, pattern separation, and novelty detection, as well as in brain disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy and depression. Despite their functional relevance, little is known about the determinants that control MC activity. Here, we examined whether MCs express functional kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors involved in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and epilepsy. Using mouse hippocampal slices, we found that bath application of submicromolar and micromolar concentrations of the KAR agonist kainic acid induced inward currents and robust MC firing. These effects were abolished in GluK2 KO mice, indicating the presence of functional GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. In contrast to CA3 pyramidal cells, which are structurally and functionally similar to MCs and express synaptic KARs at mossy fiber (MF) inputs (i.e., GC axons), we found no evidence for KAR-mediated transmission at MF&ndash;MC synapses, indicating that most KARs at MCs are extrasynaptic. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy analyses confirmed the extrasynaptic localization of GluK2-containing KARs in MCs. Finally, blocking glutamate transporters, a manipulation that increases extracellular levels of endogenous glutamate, was sufficient to induce KAR-mediated inward currents in MCs, suggesting that MC-KARs can be activated by increases in ambient glutamate. Our findings provide the first direct evidence of functional extrasynaptic KARs at a critical excitatory neuron of the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hilar mossy cells (MCs) are an understudied population of hippocampal neurons that form an excitatory loop with dentate granule cells. MCs have been implicated in pattern separation, spatial navigation, and epilepsy. Despite their importance in hippocampal function and disease, little is known about how MC activity is recruited. Here, we show for the first time that MCs express extrasynaptic kainate receptors (KARs), a subtype of glutamate receptors critically involved in neuronal function and epilepsy. While we found no evidence for synaptic KARs in MCs, KAR activation induced strong action potential firing of MCs, raising the possibility that extracellular KARs regulate MC excitability <I>in vivo</I> and may also promote dentate gyrus hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Morpho-Electric Properties and Diversity of Oxytocin Neurons in Paraventricular Nucleus of Hypothalamus in Female and Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin (OXT) neurons in paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) are involved in modulating multiple functions, including social, maternal, feeding, and emotional related behaviors. PVN OXT neurons are canonically classified into magnocellular (Magno) and parvocellular (Parvo) subtypes. However, morpho-electric properties and the diversity of PVN OXT neurons are not well investigated. In this study, we profiled the morpho-electric properties of PVN OXT neurons by combining transgenic mice, electrophysiological recording, morphologic reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analyses. Total 224 PVN OXT neurons from 23 mice were recorded and used for analyses in this study, and 29 morpho-electric parameters were measured. Magno and Parvo OXT neurons have prominent differences in their morpho-electric features, and PVN OXT neurons in male and female mice share similar neuronal properties. Some morpho-electric features of PVN OXT neurons, especially Magno neurons, exhibit significant diverse changes along the rostral&ndash;caudal axis. Furthermore, we find that PVN OXT neurons are classified into at least six subtypes based on their morpho-electric properties via unsupervised clustering. Only one Magno-Parvo mixed subtype in posterior PVN subregion, but not the other five subtypes, showed significant neuronal activity change in different feeding conditions. Our study supports the diversity of PVN OXT neurons and subtle neuron classification will promote excavating the functions of oxytocinergic system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin (OXT) is well known for its function in labor induction, but it also plays multiple roles in social, feeding, and emotional behaviors via modulating different brain regions. Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) OXT neurons are traditionally classified into magnocellular and parvocellular. However, functional and single-cell transcriptomic studies indicate that OXT neurons should be further classified. Here, we thoroughly investigated the morpho-electric properties and spatial distribution of PVN OXT neurons, and find that OXT neurons have at least six subtypes based on their morpho-electric features. Among these six subtypes, only one magnocellular-parvocellular mixed subtype, which are distributed in the posterior PVN subregion, change their activities with different feeding states. Our study uncovers the diversity of PVN OXT neurons and suggests the necessary of subtle neuronal classification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cocaine-Induced Changes in Sperm Cdkn1a Methylation Are Associated with Cocaine Resistance in Male Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <p>Paternal environmental perturbations can influence the physiology and behavior of offspring. For example, our previous work showed reduced cocaine reinforcement in male, but not female, progeny of rat sires that self-administered cocaine. The information transfer from sire to progeny may occur through epigenetic marks in sperm, encompassing alterations in small noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and/or DNA methylation. Here, no reliable changes in miRNAs in the sperm of cocaine- relative to saline-experienced sires were identified. In contrast, 272 differentially methylated regions were observed in sperm between these groups. Two hypomethylated promoter regions in the sperm of cocaine-experienced rats were upstream of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (<I>Cdkn1a</I>). <I>Cdkn1a</I> mRNA also was selectively increased in the NAc of cocaine-sired male (but not female) offspring. Cocaine self-administration also enhanced <I>Cdkn1a</I> expression in the accumbens of cocaine-sired rats. These results suggest that changes in <I>Cdkn1a</I> may play a role in the reduced cocaine reinforcing efficacy observed in cocaine-sired male rats. Introducing a 90 d delay between sire self-administration and breeding reversed both cocaine resistance and the increase in accumbens <I>Cdkn1a</I> mRNA in male offspring, indicating that cocaine-induced epigenetic modifications are eliminated with sperm turnover. Collectively, our results indicate that cocaine self-administration produces hypomethylation of <I>Cdkn1a</I> in sperm and a selective increase in the expression of this gene in the NAc of male offspring, which is associated with blunted cocaine reinforcement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The relatively new field of transgenerational epigenetics explores the effects of environmental perturbations on offspring behavior and physiology. Our prior work in rats indicated that male, but not female, progeny of sires that self-administered cocaine displayed reduced cocaine reinforcement. The information transfer from sire to progeny may occur through heritable epigenetic marks in sperm, including DNA methylation. The present findings revealed two hypomethylated promoter regions upstream of the <I>Cdkn1a</I> gene in sire sperm. Remarkably, <I>Cdkn1a</I> expression was selectively decreased in offspring NAc, a brain region that regulates cocaine reinforcement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Strong Gamma Frequency Oscillations in the Adolescent Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Working memory ability continues to mature into adulthood in humans and nonhuman primates. At the single-neuron level, adolescent development is characterized by increased prefrontal firing rate in the delay period, but less is known about how coordinated activity between neurons is altered. Local field potentials (LFPs) provide a window into the computations conducted by the local network. To address the effects of adolescent development on LFP activity, three male rhesus monkeys were trained to perform an oculomotor delayed response task and tested at both the adolescent and adult stages. Simultaneous single-unit and LFP signals were recorded from areas 8a and 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In both the cue and delay period, power relative to baseline in the gamma frequency range (32&ndash;128 Hz) was higher in the adolescent than the adult stage. The changes between developmental stages could not be accounted for by differences in performance and were observed in more posterior as well as more anterior recording sites. In the adult stage, high-firing neurons were also more likely to reside at sites with strong gamma power increase from baseline. For both stages, the gamma power increase in the delay was selective for sites with neuron-encoding stimulus information in their spiking. Our results establish gamma power decrease to be a feature of prefrontal cortical maturation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Gamma-frequency oscillations in extracellular field recordings (e.g., local field potential or EEG) are a marker of normal interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neural circuits. Abnormally low gamma power during working memory is seen in conditions such as schizophrenia. We sought to examine whether the immature prefrontal cortex similarly exhibits lower power in the gamma-frequency range during working memory, in a nonhuman primate model of adolescence. Contrary to this expectation, the adolescent PFC exhibited stronger gamma power during the maintenance of working memory. Our findings reveal an unknown developmental maturation trajectory of gamma-band oscillations, propose a refinement of information encoding during PFC maturation, and raise the possibility that schizophrenia represents an excessive state of prefrontal maturation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Drosophila Circuit for Habituation Override</a></h4>

              
                <p>Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability to override habituation is best explained by postulating that habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs onto stimulus-encoding assemblies and that habituation override occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory and gustatory habituation in <I>Drosophila</I>. Here, we analyze how exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory (proboscis extension reflex; PER) habituation. While brief sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes naive <I>Drosophila</I> to extend their proboscis, persistent exposure reduces PER to subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores PER response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic activation of a population of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, a subset of which send projections to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the habituated state, with no effect on the naive sucrose response across a range of concentrations. Taken together with other findings, these observations in female flies are consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly, inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The implications of these findings for general mechanisms of attentional and sensory override of habituation are discussed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Habituation can be overcome when a new context requires an enhanced response to a familiar stimulus. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have provided evidence that habituation of the sucrose-induced proboscis extension reflex (PER) in <I>Drosophila</I> occurs through potentiation of inhibition onto the PER pathway. This work defines controlled protocols for override of PER habituation and uses them to outline the underlying circuit mechanisms. The results presented support a model in which novel taste stimuli cause dishabituation by activating a subset of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons that inhibit GABAergic neurons whose potentiation underlies PER habituation. At a general level, these findings further highlight a central role for inhibition and disinhibition in the control of behavioral flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disinhibitory Circuitry Gates Associative Synaptic Plasticity in Olfactory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory microcircuits play an essential role in regulating cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Interneurons that inhibit dendritic or somatic integration act as gatekeepers for neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and the formation of sensory representations. Conversely, interneurons that selectively inhibit other interneurons can open gates through disinhibition. In the anterior piriform cortex, relief of inhibition permits associative LTP of excitatory synapses between pyramidal neurons. However, the interneurons and circuits mediating disinhibition have not been elucidated. In this study, we use an optogenetic approach in mice of both sexes to identify the inhibitory interneurons and disinhibitory circuits that regulate LTP. We focused on three prominent interneuron classes: somatostatin (SST), parvalbumin (PV), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons. We find that LTP is gated by the inactivation SST or PV interneurons and by the activation of VIP interneurons. Further, VIP interneurons strongly inhibit putative SST cells during LTP induction but only weakly inhibit PV interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that VIP interneurons mediate a disinhibitory circuit that gates synaptic plasticity during the formation of olfactory representations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibitory interneurons stabilize neural activity during sensory processing. However, inhibition must also be modulated to allow sensory experience shape neural responses. In olfactory cortex, inhibition regulates activity-dependent increases in excitatory synaptic strength that accompany odor learning. We identify two inhibitory interneuron classes that act as gatekeepers preventing excitatory enhancement. We demonstrate that driving a third class of interneurons inhibits the gatekeepers and opens the gate for excitatory enhancement. All three inhibitory neuron classes comprise disinhibitory microcircuit motifs found throughout the cortex. Our findings suggest that a common disinhibitory microcircuit promotes changes in synaptic strength during sensory processing and learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prior Expectations in Visual Speed Perception Predict Encoding Characteristics of Neurons in Area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bayesian inference provides an elegant theoretical framework for understanding the characteristic biases and discrimination thresholds in visual speed perception. However, the framework is difficult to validate because of its flexibility and the fact that suitable constraints on the structure of the sensory uncertainty have been missing. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding not only well explains human visual speed perception but also provides an accurate quantitative account of the tuning characteristics of neurons known for representing visual speed. Specifically, we found that the population coding accuracy for visual speed in area MT ("neural prior") is precisely predicted by the power-law, slow-speed prior extracted from fitting the Bayesian observer model to psychophysical data ("behavioral prior") to the point that the two priors are indistinguishable in a cross-validation model comparison. Our results demonstrate a quantitative validation of the Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding at both the behavioral and neural levels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Statistical regularities of the environment play an important role in shaping both neural representations and perceptual behavior. Most previous work addressed these two aspects independently. Here we present a quantitative validation of a theoretical framework that makes joint predictions for neural coding and behavior, based on the assumption that neural representations of sensory information are efficient but also optimally used in generating a percept. Specifically, we demonstrate that the neural tuning characteristics for visual speed in brain area MT are precisely predicted by the statistical prior expectations extracted from psychophysical data. As such, our results provide a normative link between perceptual behavior and the neural representation of sensory information in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Thalamocortical Mechanisms for Nostalgia-Induced Analgesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>As a predominately positive emotion, nostalgia serves various adaptive functions, including a recently revealed analgesic effect. The current fMRI study aimed to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the nostalgia-induced analgesic effect on noxious thermal stimuli of different intensities. Human participants' (males and females) behavior results showed that the nostalgia paradigm significantly reduced participants' perception of pain, particularly at low pain intensities. fMRI analysis revealed that analgesia was related to decreased brain activity in pain-related brain regions, including the lingual and parahippocampal gyrus. Notably, anterior thalamic activation during the nostalgia stage predicted posterior parietal thalamus activation during the pain stage, suggesting that the thalamus might play a key role as a central functional linkage in the analgesic effect. Moreover, while thalamus-PAG functional connectivity was found to be related to nostalgic strength, periaqueductal gray-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PAG-dlPFC) functional connectivity was found to be associated with pain perception, suggesting possible analgesic modulatory pathways. These findings demonstrate the analgesic effect of nostalgia and, more importantly, shed light on its neural mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Nostalgia is known to reduce individuals' perception of physical pain. The underlying brain mechanisms, however, are unclear. Our study found that the thalamus plays a key role as a functional linkage between nostalgia and pain, suggesting a possible analgesic modulatory mechanism of nostalgia. These findings have implications for the underlying brain mechanisms of psychological analgesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emotion Downregulation Targets Interoceptive Brain Regions While Emotion Upregulation Targets Other Affective Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers generally agree that when upregulating and downregulating emotion, control regions in the prefrontal cortex turn up or down activity in affect-generating brain areas. However, the "affective dial hypothesis" that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the regions activated during upregulation and those deactivated during downregulation in 54 male and 51 female humans. We found that upregulation and downregulation both recruit regulatory regions, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, but act on distinct affect-generating regions. Upregulation increased activity in regions associated with emotional experience, such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum, and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity, such as periventricular white matter, while downregulation decreased activity in regions receiving interoceptive input, such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus. Nevertheless, participants' subjective sense of emotional intensity was associated with activity in overlapping brain regions (dorsal anterior cingulate, insula, thalamus, and frontal pole) across upregulation and downregulation. These findings indicate that upregulation and downregulation rely on overlapping brain regions to control and assess emotions but target different affect-generating brain regions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many contexts require modulating one's own emotions. Identifying the brain areas implementing these regulatory processes should advance understanding emotional disorders and designing potential interventions. The emotion regulation field has an implicit assumption we call the affective dial hypothesis: both emotion upregulation and downregulation modulate the same emotion-generating brain areas. Countering the hypothesis, our findings indicate that up- and down-modulating emotions target different brain areas. Thus, the mechanisms underlying emotion regulation might differ more than previously appreciated for upregulation versus downregulation. In addition to their theoretical importance, these findings are critical for researchers attempting to target activity in particular brain regions during an emotion regulation intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Precise and Pervasive Phasic Bursting in Locus Coeruleus during Maternal Behavior in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) mediates key aspects of arousal, memory, and cognition in structured tasks, but its contribution to naturalistic behavior remains unclear. LC activity is thought to multiplex distinct signals by superimposing sustained ("tonic") firing patterns reflecting global brain states, such as arousal and anxiety, and rapidly fluctuating ("phasic") bursts signaling discrete behaviorally significant events. Manipulations of the LC noradrenergic system broadly impair social behavior, but the temporal structure of LC firing and its relationship to social interaction is unknown. One possibility is that tonic firing may increase in the presence of social partners; it is also possible that phasic bursts may accompany specific social events. We used chronic <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology and fiber photometry to measure single-unit and population neural activity in LC of freely behaving mice during their interactions with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits remarkably precise phasic activity in LC that cannot be attributed merely to sensory stimuli, motor activity, or reward. Correlation of LC activity with retrieval events shows that phasic events are most closely related to specific subsequent behaviors. The reliability and magnitude of phasic responses strongly suggest that these events are coordinated across LC and broadcast noradrenaline (NA) release throughout the brain. We also observed slow changes in tonic firing when females performed distinct maternal behaviors such as nest building and pup grooming. We therefore propose that LC signals state changes during sustained interactions and contributes to goal-directed action selection during social behavior with globally broadcast NA release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) brain wide, influencing many cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Multifunctionality of LC is maintained by multiplexing NA signaling via brief "phasic" patterns of bursting and slowly changing "tonic" firing. Manipulations of NA impair social behavior, yet the structure of LC activity with respect to specific social events is unknown. We measured LC activity in mice freely interacting with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits precisely timed and pervasive phasic activation of LC that anticipates specific behaviors. We also found that LC neurons exhibited slow fluctuations in firing during sustained behaviors. We propose that LC simultaneously contributes to goal-directed social action selection with globally broadcast NA release and signals social state changes with increased tonic firing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Context Modulates Encoding and Retrieval of Overlapping Events</a></h4>

              
                <p>Overlap between events can lead to interference because of a trade-off between encoding the present event and retrieving the past event. Temporal context information, "when" something occurred, a defining feature of episodic memory, can cue retrieval of a past event. However, the influence of temporal overlap, or proximity in time, on the mechanisms of interference is unclear. Here, by identifying brain states using scalp EEG from male and female human subjects, we show the extent to which temporal overlap promotes interference and induces retrieval. In this experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to either encode the present event or retrieve a past, overlapping event while perceptual input was held constant. We find that the degree of temporal overlap between events leads to selective interference. Specifically, greater temporal overlap between two events leads to impaired memory for the past event selectively when the top-down goal is to encode the present event. Using pattern classification analyses to measure neural evidence for a retrieval state, we find that greater temporal overlap leads to automatic retrieval of a past event, independent of top-down goals. Critically, the retrieval evidence we observe likely reflects a general retrieval mode, rather than retrieval success or effort. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of temporal overlap on interference and memory formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When a present event overlaps with an event from the past, this leads to a trade-off between the tendency to encode the present event versus retrieve the past event. Here we show that, when two events are experienced nearby in time, the memory system is biased toward a retrieval state and that subsequent memory for the past event is impaired. These findings suggest an influence of bottom-up temporal factors on both interference and the trade-off between memory states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">S-Nitrosylation of p62 Inhibits Autophagic Flux to Promote {alpha}-Synuclein Secretion and Spread in Parkinson's Disease and Lewy Body Dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dysregulation of autophagic pathways leads to accumulation of abnormal proteins and damaged organelles in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Autophagy-related dysfunction may also trigger secretion and spread of misfolded proteins, such as &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn), the major misfolded protein found in PD/LBD. However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena remains largely unknown. Here, we used cell-based models, including human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and male transgenic PD/LBD mice, plus vetting in human postmortem brains (both male and female). We provide mechanistic insight into this pathologic pathway. We find that aberrant S-nitrosylation of the autophagic adaptor protein p62 causes inhibition of autophagic flux and intracellular buildup of misfolded proteins, with consequent secretion resulting in cell-to-cell spread. Thus, our data show that pathologic protein S-nitrosylation of p62 represents a critical factor not only for autophagic inhibition and demise of individual neurons, but also for &alpha;-syn release and spread of disease throughout the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, dysfunctional autophagy contributes to accumulation and spread of aggregated &alpha;-synuclein. Here, we provide evidence that protein S-nitrosylation of p62 inhibits autophagic flux, contributing to &alpha;-synuclein aggregation and spread.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adaptive Mossy Cell Circuit Plasticity after Status Epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hilar mossy cells regulate network function in the hippocampus through both direct excitation and di-synaptic inhibition of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Substantial mossy cell loss accompanies hippocampal circuit changes in epilepsy. We examined the contribution of surviving mossy cells to network activity in the reorganized dentate gyrus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). To examine functional circuit changes, we optogenetically stimulated mossy cells in acute hippocampal slices from male mice. In control mice, activation of mossy cells produced monosynaptic excitatory and di-synaptic GABAergic currents in DGCs. In pilocarpine-treated mice, mossy cell density and excitation of DGCs were reduced in parallel, with only a minimal reduction in feedforward inhibition, enhancing the inhibition/excitation ratio. Surprisingly, mossy cell-driven excitation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells, primary mediators of feed-forward inhibition, was maintained. Our results suggest that mossy cell outputs reorganize following seizures, increasing their net inhibitory effect in the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hilar mossy cell loss in epilepsy is associated with hippocampal hyperexcitability, potentially as a result of disrupted dentate microcircuit function. We used transgenic mice, translational mouse modeling, viral vectors, and optogenetics to selectively examine functional changes to mossy cell outputs following status epilepticus (SE). Interestingly, the outputs of surviving mossy cells exhibited adaptive plasticity onto target parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, resulting in a relative increase in their inhibitory control of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Our findings suggest that residual mossy cell outputs can reorganize in a homeostatic manner, which may provide clues for therapeutic targeting of this microcircuit.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain is sustained by a maladaptive form of neuronal plasticity occurring in all stations of the pain neuraxis, including cortical regions of the pain matrix. We report that chronic inflammatory pain induced by unilateral injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the hindpaw of male mice was associated with a progressive build-up of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (SSC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and reticular thalamic nucleus. In the SSC, the density of PNNs labeled by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) was increased at both 3 and 7 d following CFA injection, but only after 7 d in the mPFC. The number of parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons enwrapped by WFA<sup>+</sup>/PNNs was also increased in all three brain regions of mice injected with CFA. Remarkably, PNN degradation induced by intracortical infusion of chondroitinase-ABC significantly reduced mechanical and thermal pain, and also reversed the increased frequency of IPSCs recorded in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the contralateral SSC in CFA-injected mice. These findings suggest a possible relationship between cortical PNNs and nociceptive sensitization, and support the hypothesis that PNNs maintain their plasticity in the adult life and regulate cortical responses to sensory inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain extracellular matrix not only provides structural support, but also regulates synapse formation and function, and modulates neuronal excitability. We found that chronic inflammatory pain in mice enhances the density of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Remarkably, enzymatic degradation of PNNs in the somatosensory cortex caused analgesia and reversed alterations of inhibitory synaptic transmission associated with chronic pain. These findings disclose a novel mechanism of nociceptive sensitization and support a role for PNNs in mechanisms of neuronal plasticity in the adult brain.</p>

                <p>Anxiety disorders are a series of mental disorders characterized by anxiety and fear, but the molecular basis of these disorders remains unclear. In the present study, we find that the global <I>Slack KO</I> male mice exhibit anxious behaviors, whereas the Slack <I>Y777H</I> male mice manifest anxiolytic behaviors. The expression of Slack channels is rich in basolateral amygdala (BLA) glutamatergic neurons and downregulated in chronic corticosterone-treated mice.

Furthermore, the Slack channel deletion in BLA glutamatergic neurons is sufficient to result in enhanced avoidance behaviors, whereas <I>Kcnt1</I> gene expression in the BLA or BLA&ndash;ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections reverses anxious behaviors of the <I>Slack KO</I> mice.

Here, we examined the behaviors of loss- and gain-of-function of Slack channel mice in elevated plus maze and open field tests and found the anxiolytic role of the Slack channel. By altering the Slack channel expression in the specific neuronal circuit, we demonstrated that the Slack channel played its anxiolytic role by decreasing the excitability of BLA&ndash;vHPC glutamatergic projections. Our data reveal the role of the Slack channel in the regulation of anxiety, which may provide a potential molecular target for anxiolytic therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vocalizations are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (<i>Scotinomys teguina</i>) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. The progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing clinical dosing of combination broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV prevention</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bryan T. Mayer, Allan C. deCamp, Yunda Huang, Joshua T. Schiffer, Raphael Gottardo, Peter B. Gilbert, Daniel B. Reeves</p>

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are promising agents to prevent HIV infection and achieve HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART). As with ART, bNAb combinations are likely needed to cover HIV’s extensive diversity. Not all bNAbs are identical in terms of their breadth, potency, and <i>in vivo</i> longevity (half-life). Given these differences, it is important to optimally select the composition, or dose ratio, of combination bNAb therapies for future clinical studies. We developed a model that synthesizes 1) pharmacokinetics, 2) potency against a wide HIV diversity, 3) interaction models for how drugs work together, and 4) correlates that translate <i>in vitro</i> potency to clinical protection. We found optimization requires drug-specific balances between potency, longevity, and interaction type. As an example, tradeoffs between longevity and potency are shown by comparing a combination therapy to a bi-specific antibody (a single protein merging both bNAbs) that takes the better potency but the worse longevity of the two components. Then, we illustrate a realistic dose ratio optimization of a triple combination of VRC07, 3BNC117, and 10–1074 bNAbs. We apply protection estimates derived from both a non-human primate (NHP) challenge study meta-analysis and the human antibody mediated prevention (AMP) trials. In both cases, we find a 2:1:1 dose emphasizing VRC07 is nearly optimal. Our approach can be immediately applied to optimize the next generation of combination antibody prevention and cure studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epigenetic cell memory: The gene’s inner chromatin modification circuit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Simone Bruno, Ruth J. Williams, Domitilla Del Vecchio</p>

Epigenetic cell memory allows distinct gene expression patterns to persist in different cell types despite a common genotype. Although different patterns can be maintained by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), it was proposed that long-term persistence hinges on chromatin state. Here, we study how the dynamics of chromatin state affect memory, and focus on a biologically motivated circuit motif, among histones and DNA modifications, that mediates the action of TFs on gene expression. Memory arises from time-scale separation among three circuit’s constituent processes: basal erasure, auto and cross-catalysis, and recruited erasure of modifications. When the two latter processes are sufficiently faster than the former, the circuit exhibits bistability and hysteresis, allowing active and repressed gene states to coexist and persist after TF stimulus removal. The duration of memory is stochastic with a mean value that increases as time-scale separation increases, but more so for the repressed state. This asymmetry stems from the cross-catalysis between repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation and is enhanced by the relatively slower decay rate of the latter. Nevertheless, TF-mediated positive autoregulation can rebalance this asymmetry and even confers robustness of active states to repressive stimuli. More generally, by wiring positively autoregulated chromatin modification circuits under time scale separation, long-term distinct gene expression patterns arise, which are also robust to failure in the regulatory links.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dowker complex based machine learning (DCML) models for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiang Liu, Huitao Feng, Jie Wu, Kelin Xia</p>

With the great advancements in experimental data, computational power and learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) based drug design has begun to gain momentum recently. AI-based drug design has great promise to revolutionize pharmaceutical industries by significantly reducing the time and cost in drug discovery processes. However, a major issue remains for all AI-based learning model that is efficient molecular representations. Here we propose Dowker complex (DC) based molecular interaction representations and Riemann Zeta function based molecular featurization, for the first time. Molecular interactions between proteins and ligands (or others) are modeled as Dowker complexes. A multiscale representation is generated by using a filtration process, during which a series of DCs are generated at different scales. Combinatorial (Hodge) Laplacian matrices are constructed from these DCs, and the Riemann zeta functions from their spectral information can be used as molecular descriptors. To validate our models, we consider protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our DC-based machine learning (DCML) models, in particular, DC-based gradient boosting tree (DC-GBT), are tested on three most-commonly used datasets, i.e., including PDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013 and PDBbind-2016, and extensively compared with other existing state-of-the-art models. It has been found that our DC-based descriptors can achieve the state-of-the-art results and have better performance than all machine learning models with traditional molecular descriptors. Our Dowker complex based machine learning models can be used in other tasks in AI-based drug design and molecular data analysis.

     alt="Brain-wide mapping of inputs to the mouse lateral posterior (LP/Pulvinar) thalamus–anterior cingulate cortex network"/>
<p>We perform projection-specific monosynaptic mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP and ACC network in mice and show that the LP-ACC network integrates information from regions which parallel that of the primate pulvinar-prefrontal network. LP→ACC and ACC→LP neurons share common sources of inputs from regions involved in orienting and sensorimotor control. Inputs to the ACC→LP projection may serve to provide spatial context or visuomotor instructions, while the bottom-up LP→ACC circuit integrates multisensory information and could serve as a route for SC feedback to frontal cortex. Our study serves as a primer for future circuit-level examination of LP-ACC interactions and inputs integrated by this circuit.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rodent homolog of the primate pulvinar, the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus, is extensively interconnected with multiple cortical areas. While these cortical interactions can span the entire LP, subdivisions of the LP are characterized by differential connections with specific cortical regions. In particular, the medial LP has reciprocal connections with frontoparietal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC plays an integral role in top-down sensory processing and attentional regulation, likely exerting some of these functions via the LP. However, little is known about how ACC and LP interact, and about the information potentially integrated in this reciprocal network. Here, we address this gap by employing a projection-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to delineate brain-wide inputs to bottom-up LP→ACC and top-down ACC→LP neurons. We find that LP→ACC neurons receive inputs from widespread cortical regions, including primary and higher order sensory and motor cortical areas. LP→ACC neurons also receive extensive subcortical inputs, particularly from the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Sensory inputs to ACC→LP neurons largely arise from visual cortical areas. In addition, ACC→LP neurons integrate cross-hemispheric prefrontal cortex inputs as well as inputs from higher order medial cortex. Our brain-wide anatomical mapping of inputs to the reciprocal LP-ACC pathways provides a roadmap for understanding how LP and ACC communicate different sources of information to mediate attentional control and visuomotor functions.</p>

                Mutations in epigenetic factors are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this issue of Neuron, Yan et al. (2022) show that the antagonism of ASH1L and PRC2 switches the equilibrium of histone methylation at the ephrin receptor A7 locus, causing decreased EphA7 expression, deficits in synaptic pruning, and ASD-like behaviors.

                Dr. John Q. Trojanowski made myriad highly influential contributions to the fields of neurodegeneration, neuropathology, and the broader neurosciences over the span of 50 years, almost all of them alongside Virginia Lee, his lifelong partner and scientific collaborator. His work transformed our understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, and Parkinson’s disease. John died on February 8, 2022, in Philadelphia, due to complications associated with spinal cord injuries following a fall shortly after his 75th birthday.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Concerted modification of nucleotides at functional centers of the ribosome revealed by single-molecule RNA modification profiling</a></h4>

              
                Nucleotides in RNA and DNA are chemically modified by numerous enzymes that alter their function. Eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is modified at more than 100 locations, particularly at highly conserved and functionally important nucleotides. During ribosome biogenesis, modifications are added at various stages of assembly. The existence of differently modified classes of ribosomes in normal cells is unknown because no method exists to simultaneously evaluate the modification status at all sites within a single rRNA molecule. Using a combination of yeast genetics and nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we developed a reliable method to track the modification status of single rRNA molecules at 37 sites in 18S rRNA and 73 sites in 25S rRNA. We use our method to characterize patterns of modification heterogeneity and identify concerted modification of nucleotides found near functional centers of the ribosome. Distinct, undermodified subpopulations of rRNAs accumulate upon loss of Dbp3 or Prp43 RNA helicases, suggesting overlapping roles in ribosome biogenesis. Modification profiles are surprisingly resistant to change in response to many genetic and acute environmental conditions that affect translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing. The ability to capture single molecule RNA modification profiles provides new insights into the roles of nucleotide modifications in RNA function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Short-term plasticity in the human visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                While there is evidence that the visual cortex retains a potential for plasticity in adulthood, less is known about the subcortical stages of visual processing. Here we asked whether short-term ocular dominance plasticity affects the human visual thalamus. We addressed this question in normally sighted adult humans, using ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance imaging combined with the paradigm of short-term monocular deprivation. With this approach, we previously demonstrated transient shifts of perceptual eye dominance and ocular dominance in visual cortex (Binda et al., 2018). Here we report evidence for short-term plasticity in the ventral division of the pulvinar (vPulv), where the deprived eye representation was enhanced over the non-deprived eye. This ventral-pulvinar plasticity was similar as previously seen in visual cortex and it was correlated with the ocular dominance shift measured behaviorally. In contrast, there was no effect of monocular deprivation in two adjacent thalamic regions: dorsal pulvinar (dPulv), and Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). We conclude that the visual thalamus retains potential for short-term plasticity in adulthood; the plasticity effect differs across thalamic subregions, possibly reflecting differences in their cortico-fugal connectivity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Late-life fitness gains and reproductive death in Cardiocondyla obscurior ants</a></h4>

              
                A key hypothesis for the occurrence of senescence is the decrease in selection strength due to the decrease in the proportion of newborns from parents attaining an advanced age – the so-called selection shadow. Strikingly, queens of social insects have long lifespans and reproductive senescence seems to be negligible. By lifelong tracking of 99 <i>Cardiocondyla obscurior</i> (Formicidae: Myrmicinae) ant colonies, we find that queens shift to the production of sexuals in late life regardless of their absolute lifespan or the number of workers present. Furthermore, RNAseq analyses of old queens past their peak of reproductive performance showed the development of massive pathology while queens were still fertile, leading to rapid death. We conclude that the evolution of superorganismality is accompanied by ‘continuusparity,’ a life history strategy that is distinct from other iteroparous and semelparous strategies across the tree of life, in that it combines continuous reproduction with a fitness peak late in life.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Acquisition of cellular properties during alveolar formation requires differential activity and distribution of mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Alveolar formation requires coordinated movement and interaction between alveolar epithelial cells, mesenchymal myofibroblasts and endothelial cells/pericytes to produce secondary septa. These processes rely on the acquisition of distinct cellular properties to enable ligand secretion for cell-cell signaling and initiate morphogenesis through cellular contraction, cell migration and cell shape change. In this study, we showed that mitochondrial activity and distribution play a key role in bestowing cellular functions on both alveolar epithelial cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts for generating secondary septa to form alveoli in mice. These results suggest that mitochondrial function is tightly regulated to empower cellular machineries in a spatially-specific manner. Indeed, such regulation via mitochondria is required for secretion of ligands, such as platelet-derived growth factor, from alveolar epithelial cells to influence myofibroblast proliferation and contraction/migration. Moreover, mitochondrial function enables myofibroblast contraction/migration during alveolar formation. Together, these findings yield novel mechanistic insights into how mitochondria regulate pivotal steps of alveologenesis. They highlight selective utilization of energy in cells and diverse energy demands in different cellular processes during development. Our work serves as a paradigm for studying how mitochondria control tissue patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning cortical representations through perturbed and adversarial dreaming</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals learn to extract general concepts from sensory experience without extensive teaching. This ability is thought to be facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are systemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs.

	<p>Grounded cognition theory postulates that cognitive processes related to motor or sensory content are processed by brain networks involved in motor execution and perception, respectively. Processing words with auditory features was shown to activate the auditory cortex. Our study aimed at determining whether onomatopoetic verbs (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;tr&amp;amp;ouml;pfeln&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;to dripple), whose articulation reproduces the sound of respective actions, engage the auditory cortex more than non-onomatopoetic verbs. Alpha and beta brain frequencies as well as evoked-related fields (ERFs) were targeted as potential neurophysiological correlates of this linguistic auditory quality. Twenty participants were measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) while semantically processing visually presented onomatopoetic and non-onomatopoetic German verbs. While a descriptively stronger left temporal alpha desynchronization for onomatopoetic verbs did not reach statistical significance, a larger ERF for onomatopoetic verbs emerged at about 240 ms in the centro-parietal area. Findings suggest increased cortical activation related to onomatopoeias in linguistically relevant areas.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although the microenvironment for peripheral nerve regeneration is permissive, such a mechanism is ok in diabetes, and the molecular mediators remain elusive. This study aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between skin innervation and collagen pathology in diabetic neuropathy and to (2) clarify the molecular alterations that occur in response to hyperglycemia and their effects on axon regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We addressed this issue using two complementary systems: (1) human skin from patients with diabetic neuropathy and to (2) a coculture model of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in the context of intrinsic neuronal factor and extrinsic microenvironmental collagen and its biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In diabetic neuropathy, the skin innervation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFd), a measure of sensory nerve degeneration, was reduced with similar expression of a growth associated protein 43, a marker of nerve regeneration. In contrast, the content and packing of collagen in the diabetic skin became more rigid than the control skin. Sec31a, a protein that regulates the collagen biosynthetic pathway, was upregulated and inversely correlated with IENFd. In the cell model, activated HDFs exposed to high-glucose medium enhanced the expression of Sec31a and collagen I through the activation of transforming growth factor β, a profibrotic molecule. Sec31a upregulation impaired neurite outgrowth. This effect was reversed by silencing Sec31a expression and neurite outgrowth was resumed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The current study provides evidence that Sec31a plays a key role in inhibiting nerve regeneration in diabetic neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Implementation of residue-level coarse-grained models in GENESIS for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cheng Tan, Jaewoon Jung, Chigusa Kobayashi, Diego Ugarte La Torre, Shoji Takada, Yuji Sugita</p>

Residue-level coarse-grained (CG) models have become one of the most popular tools in biomolecular simulations in the trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. To investigate large-scale biological phenomena in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with CG models, unified treatments of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as efficient parallel computations, are indispensable. In the GENESIS MD software, we implement several residue-level CG models, covering structure-based and context-based potentials for both well-folded biomolecules and intrinsically disordered regions. An amino acid residue in protein is represented as a single CG particle centered at the Cα atom position, while a nucleotide in RNA or DNA is modeled with three beads. Then, a single CG particle represents around ten heavy atoms in both proteins and nucleic acids. The input data in CG MD simulations are treated as GROMACS-style input files generated from a newly developed toolbox, GENESIS-CG-tool. To optimize the performance in CG MD simulations, we utilize multiple neighbor lists, each of which is attached to a different nonbonded interaction potential in the cell-linked list method. We found that random number generations for Gaussian distributions in the Langevin thermostat are one of the bottlenecks in CG MD simulations. Therefore, we parallelize the computations with message-passing-interface (MPI) to improve the performance on PC clusters or supercomputers. We simulate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 B-capsid and chromatin models containing more than 1,000 nucleosomes in GENESIS as examples of large-scale biomolecular simulations with residue-level CG models. This framework extends accessible spatial and temporal scales by multi-scale simulations to study biologically relevant phenomena, such as genome-scale chromatin folding or phase-separated membrane-less condensations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical asymmetries at different spatial hierarchies relate to phonological processing ability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mark A. Eckert, Kenneth I. Vaden Jr., Federico Iuricich, Dyslexia Data Consortium </p>

The ability to map speech sounds to corresponding letters is critical for establishing proficient reading. People vary in this phonological processing ability, which has been hypothesized to result from variation in hemispheric asymmetries within brain regions that support language. A cerebral lateralization hypothesis predicts that more asymmetric brain structures facilitate the development of foundational reading skills like phonological processing. That is, structural asymmetries are predicted to linearly increase with ability. In contrast, a canalization hypothesis predicts that asymmetries constrain behavioral performance within a normal range. That is, structural asymmetries are predicted to quadratically relate to phonological processing, with average phonological processing occurring in people with the most asymmetric structures. These predictions were examined in relatively large samples of children (<i>N =</i> 424) and adults (<i>N</i> = 300), using a topological asymmetry analysis of T1-weighted brain images and a decoding measure of phonological processing. There was limited evidence of structural asymmetry and phonological decoding associations in classic language-related brain regions. However, and in modest support of the cerebral lateralization hypothesis, small to medium effect sizes were observed where phonological decoding accuracy increased with the magnitude of the largest structural asymmetry across left hemisphere cortical regions, but not right hemisphere cortical regions, for both the adult and pediatric samples. In support of the canalization hypothesis, small to medium effect sizes were observed where phonological decoding in the normal range was associated with increased asymmetries in specific cortical regions for both the adult and pediatric samples, which included performance monitoring and motor planning brain regions that contribute to oral and written language functions. Thus, the relevance of each hypothesis to phonological decoding may depend on the scale of brain organization.

Here, Tavares et al. demonstrate that the feline sarcoma-related non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER controls invasion-propagating endosomal recycling and that high FER expression is a candidate predictive marker for taxane-containing adjuvant-chemotherapy benefit in high-risk breast cancer.

                Using cerebral organoids, Villa et al. show that CHD8 haploinsufficiency disrupts neurodevelopmental trajectories by promoting an accelerated generation of inhibitory neurons and a delayed production of excitatory neurons with a temporally restricted cell-type-specific effect on proliferation of radial glial cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Learning to represent continuous variables in heterogeneous neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Continuous features are ubiquitous in an animal’s life. They are hypothesized to be represented by neural manifold attractors. Darshan and Rivkind propose a theory of manifold attractors with biologically plausible asymmetric connectome and neural representation. They predict whether continuous memory survives asymmetry and what the functional implications of asymmetries are.

                Dopamine signals in the striatum are critical for learning and motivation. Stowe et al. show that diurnal rhythms in rapid dopamine signaling in the striatum are mediated by time-of-day shifts in cholinergic interneuron control of dopamine. These systems work together to mediate time-of-day changes in learning and motivated behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reprogramming and redifferentiation of mucosal-associated invariant T cells reveal tumor inhibitory activity</a></h4>

              
                Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells belong to a family of innate-like T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunities. Although MAIT cells have been implicated in tumor immunity, it currently remains unclear whether they function as tumor-promoting or inhibitory cells. Therefore, we herein used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate this issue. Murine MAIT cells were reprogrammed into iPSCs and redifferentiated towards MAIT-like cells (m-reMAIT cells). m-reMAIT cells were activated by an agonist in the presence and absence of antigen-presenting cells and MR1-tetramer, a reagent to detect MAIT cells. This activation accompanied protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the production of T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines and inflammatory chemokines. Upon adoptive transfer, m-reMAIT cells migrated to different organs with maturation in mice. Furthermore, m-reMAIT cells inhibited tumor growth in the lung metastasis model and prolonged mouse survival upon tumor inoculation through the NK cell-mediated reinforcement of cytolytic activity. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the utility and role of m-reMAIT cells in tumor immunity and provide insights into the function of MAIT cells in immunity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Listeria monocytogenes requires cellular respiration for NAD+ regeneration and pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cellular respiration is essential for multiple bacterial pathogens and a validated antibiotic target. In addition to driving oxidative phosphorylation, bacterial respiration has a variety of ancillary functions that obscure its contribution to pathogenesis. We find here that the intracellular pathogen <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> encodes two respiratory pathways which are partially functionally redundant and indispensable for pathogenesis. Loss of respiration decreased NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration, but this could be specifically reversed by heterologous expression of a water-forming NADH oxidase (NOX). NOX expression fully rescued intracellular growth defects and increased <i>L. monocytogenes</i> loads &gt;1,000-fold in a mouse infection model. Consistent with NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration maintaining <i>L. monocytogenes</i> viability and enabling immune evasion, a respiration-deficient strain exhibited elevated bacteriolysis within the host cytosol and NOX expression rescued this phenotype. These studies show that NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration represents a major role of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> respiration and highlight the nuanced relationship between bacterial metabolism, physiology, and pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Putting the theory into 'burstlet theory' with a biophysical model of burstlets and bursts in the respiratory preBötzinger complex</a></h4>

              
                Inspiratory breathing rhythms arise from synchronized neuronal activity in a bilaterally distributed brainstem structure known as the preBötzinger complex (preBötC). In in vitro slice preparations containing the preBötC, extracellular potassium must be elevated above physiological levels (to 7 - 9<i>mM</i>) to observe regular rhythmic respiratory motor output in the hypoglossal nerve to which the preBötC projects. Reexamination of how extracellular <i>K</i><sup>+</sup> affects preBötC neuronal activity has revealed that low amplitude oscillations persist at physiological levels. These oscillatory events are sub-threshold from the standpoint of transmission to motor output and are dubbed burstlets. Burstlets arise from synchronized neural activity in a rhythmogenic neuronal subpopulation within the preBötC that in some instances may fail to recruit the larger network events, or bursts, required to generate motor output. The fraction of subthreshold preBötC oscillatory events (burstlet fraction) decreases sigmoidally with increasing extracellular potassium. These observations underlie the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that recruitment of the non-rhythmogenic component of the preBötC population requires intracellular <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> dynamics and activation of a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. In this computational study, we show how intracellular calcium dynamics driven by synaptically triggered <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> influx as well as <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> release/uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum in conjunction with a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current can reproduce and offer an explanation for many of the key properties associated with the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Altogether, our modeling work provides a mechanistic basis that can unify a wide range of experimental findings on rhythm generation and motor output recruitment in the preBötC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Noisy metabolism can promote microbial cross-feeding</a></h4>

              
                Cross-feeding, the exchange of nutrients between organisms, is ubiquitous in microbial communities. Despite its importance in natural and engineered microbial systems, our understanding of how inter-species cross-feeding arises is incomplete, with existing theories limited to specific scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel theory for the emergence of such cross-feeding, which we term noise-averaging cooperation (NAC). NAC is based on the idea that, due to their small size, bacteria are prone to noisy regulation of metabolism which limits their growth rate. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites with each other to ‘average out’ noise and improve their collective growth. According to the Black Queen Hypothesis, this metabolite sharing among kin, a form of ‘leakage’, then allows for the evolution of metabolic interdependencies among species including de novo speciation via gene deletions. We first characterize NAC in a simple ecological model of cell metabolism, showing that metabolite leakage can in principle substantially increase growth rate in a community context. Next, we develop a generalized framework for estimating the potential benefits of NAC among real bacteria. Using single-cell protein abundance data, we predict that bacteria suffer from substantial noise-driven growth inefficiencies, and may therefore benefit from NAC. We then discuss potential evolutionary pathways for the emergence of NAC. Finally, we review existing evidence for NAC and outline potential experimental approaches to detect NAC in microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying chromosomal instability from intratumoral karyotype diversity using agent-based modeling and Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                Chromosomal instability (CIN)-persistent chromosome gain or loss through abnormal mitotic segregation-is a hallmark of cancer that drives aneuploidy. Intrinsic chromosome mis-segregation rate, a measure of CIN, can inform prognosis and is a promising biomarker for response to anti-microtubule agents. However, existing methodologies to measure this rate are labor intensive, indirect, and confounded by selection against aneuploid cells, which reduces observable diversity. We developed a framework to measure CIN, accounting for karyotype selection, using simulations with various levels of CIN and models of selection. To identify the model parameters that best fit karyotype data from single-cell sequencing, we used approximate Bayesian computation to infer mis-segregation rates and karyotype selection. Experimental validation confirmed the extensive chromosome mis-segregation rates caused by the chemotherapy paclitaxel (18.5±0.5/division). Extending this approach to clinical samples revealed that inferred rates fell within direct observations of cancer cell lines. This work provides the necessary framework to quantify CIN in human tumors and develop it as a predictive biomarker.
