              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22680">Exploring Holography in Neuro-Vascular Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holonomic brain theory, originally formulated to account for the need of non-local memory encoding in cognitive systems, could gain new theoretical traction when integrated with holographic principles from physics, most notably the AdS/CFT correspondence. Recent findings in neuroscience suggest that conformal field theories (CFTs), emerging at critical points across spatiotemporal scales in neural dynamics, are essential for brain function. Concurrently, black-brane geometries, long studied in gravitational physics, can find unexpected analogues in the interplay of active matter dynamics and the brain s neuroanatomical organization. Motivated by these parallels, we posit a generalized holographic framework and interrogate its validity through the fluid/gravity duality; a correspondence linking hydrodynamic equations to gravitational spacetime metrics. In this work, we explore the holographic principles at the Navier-Stokes regime, demonstrating that holography can model key neurophysiological mechanisms: cerebral autoregulation (the brain s hemodynamic self-stabilization) and neurovascular coupling (the dynamic neuron-bloodflow interplay). This work bridges holography, active matter physics, and neuroscience, proposing a unified framework to decode the brain s multiscale organization, its resilience to perturbations, and its computational capabilities. By grounding neurovascular physiology in gravitational duals, we open pathways to reinterpret brain function through the lens of emergent spacetime geometry.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22683">ConnectomeDiffuser: Generative AI Enables Brain Network Construction from Diffusion Tensor Imaging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information, enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks. Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22691">Early Assessment of Artificial Lower Extremity Sensory Response Times and Proprioceptive Acuity via Sensory Cortex Electrical Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-directional brain computer interfaces (BD-BCIs) may restore brain-controlled walking and artificial leg sensation after spinal cord injury. Current BD-BCIs provide only simplistic "tingling" feedback, which lacks proprioceptive information to perceive critical gait events (leg swing, double support). This information must also be perceived adequately fast to facilitate timely motor responses. Here, we investigated utilizing primary sensory cortex (S1) direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCES) to deliver leg proprioceptive information and measured response times to artificial leg sensations. Subjects with subdural electrocorticogram electrodes over S1 leg areas participated in two tasks: (1) Proprioceptive acuity: subjects identified the difference between DCES-induced percepts emulating various leg swing speeds; (2) Sensory response: measuring subjects' reaction time to DCES-induced leg sensations, with DCES-hand, visual and auditory control conditions. Three subjects were recruited. Only one completed the proprioceptive assessment, achieving 80%, 70%, 60%, and 53% accuracy in discriminating between fast/slow, fast/medium, medium/slow, and same speeds, respectively (p-value=1.9x10$^{-5}$). Response times for leg/hand percepts were 1007$\pm$413/599$\pm$171 ms, visual leg/hand responses were 528$\pm$137/384$\pm$84 ms, and auditory leg/hand responses were 393$\pm$106/352$\pm$93 ms, respectively. These results suggest proprioceptive information can be delivered artificially, but perception may be significantly delayed. Future work should address improving acuity, reducing response times, and expanding sensory modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22893">The global communication pathways of the human brain transcend the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar division</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural communication across the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum is orchestrated by the structural connectome, forming the indispensable anatomical framework for capabilities spanning from elementary motor actions to higher cognitive functions. Yet, despite this importance, the core organizational rules that govern this connectivity remain insufficiently understood. Here we show, for the first time, how the integrated cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar brain areas shape the structural architecture of the whole brain. We find dense structural clusters, which differ in composition and arrangement, vertically transverse the canonical cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar boundaries. These clusters are centralized by a global rich club of predominantly subcortical, alongside cortical hub regions. Congruently, we find that subcortical hubs are not only the most widely connected brain areas but are also leading overall structural integration. Nearly all larger subcortical structures encompass these hub regions, but they also exhibit brain regions with fewer but more specialized connections, pointing toward functional heterogeneity in these structures themselves. Our findings move beyond traditional cortico-centric analysis, offering an initial and global perspective for understanding overall structural connectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23137">An open-source Modular Online Psychophysics Platform (MOPP)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.23137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there is a growing need and opportunity to use online platforms for psychophysics research. Online experiments make it possible to evaluate large and diverse populations remotely and quickly, complementing laboratory-based research. However, developing and running online psychophysics experiments poses several challenges: i) a high barrier-to-entry for researchers who often need to learn complex code-based platforms, ii) an uncontrolled experimental environment, and iii) questionable credibility of the participants. Here, we introduce an open-source Modular Online Psychophysics Platform (MOPP) to address these challenges. Through the simple web-based interface of MOPP, researchers can build modular experiments, share them with others, and copy or modify tasks from each others environments. MOPP provides built-in features to calibrate for viewing distance and to measure visual acuity. It also includes email-based and IP-based authentication, and reCAPTCHA verification. We developed five example psychophysics tasks, that come preloaded in the environment, and ran a pilot experiment which was hosted on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud. Pilot data collected for these tasks yielded similar results to those reported in laboratory settings. MOPP can thus help researchers collect large psychophysics datasets online, with reduced turnaround time, and in a standardized manner.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18710">Bridging Critical Gaps in Convergent Learning: How Representational Alignment Evolves Across Layers, Training, and Distribution Shifts</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently trained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and models -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both neuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically examining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment metric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We present a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision models and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing gaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear regression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes (rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching (unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout training further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within the first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely driven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final task solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of out-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper layers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.

                arXiv:2505.12204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22749">Self-orthogonalizing attractor neural networks emerging from the free energy principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03972">Measuring and Controlling Solution Degeneracy across Task-Trained Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in neuroscience and machine learning to model dynamical computations. To gain mechanistic insight into how neural systems solve tasks, prior work often reverse-engineers individual trained networks. However, different RNNs trained on the same task and achieving similar performance can exhibit strikingly different internal solutions-a phenomenon known as solution degeneracy. Here, we develop a unified framework to systematically quantify and control solution degeneracy across three levels: behavior, neural dynamics, and weight space. We apply this framework to 3,400 RNNs trained on four neuroscience-relevant tasks-flip-flop memory, sine wave generation, delayed discrimination, and path integration-while systematically varying task complexity, learning regime, network size, and regularization. We find that higher task complexity and stronger feature learning reduce degeneracy in neural dynamics but increase it in weight space, with mixed effects on behavior. In contrast, larger networks and structural regularization reduce degeneracy at all three levels. These findings empirically validate the Contravariance Principle and provide practical guidance for researchers aiming to tailor RNN solutions-whether to uncover shared neural mechanisms or to model individual variability observed in biological systems. This work provides a principled framework for quantifying and controlling solution degeneracy in task-trained RNNs, offering new tools for building more interpretable and biologically grounded models of neural computation.

                arXiv:2505.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool - Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features, and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework, StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in complex traits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22994">Walking the Weight Manifold: a Topological Approach to Conditioning Inspired by Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables. Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages. First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks. Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g. noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples. These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of Genetic Fuzzy Systems (GFS) to model the self-noise generated by airfoils, a key issue in aeroaccoustics with significant implications for aerospace, automotive and drone applications. Using the publicly available Airfoil Self Noise dataset, various Fuzzy regression strategies are explored and compared. The paper evaluates a brute force Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) fuzzy system with high rule density, a cascading Geneti Fuzzy Tree (GFT) architecture and a novel clustered approach based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) to reduce the model's complexity. This highlights the viability of clustering assisted fuzzy inference as an effective regression tool for complex aero accoustic phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04358">Position: Scaling LLM Agents Requires Asymptotic Analysis with LLM Primitives</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.04358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing hard problems into subproblems often makes them easier and more efficient to solve. With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.

                arXiv:2505.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization, and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths, widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression, regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

                arXiv:2505.21717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{nonlinear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

">Cognitive and Synaptic Impairment Induced by Deficiency of Autism Risk Gene Smarcc2 and its Rescue by Histone Deacetylase Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                SMARCC2, which encodes BAF170, a core subunit of chromatin remodeling BAF complex, is one of the top-ranking risk genes for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the mechanisms linking SMARCC2 haploinsufficiency to ASD remain poorly understood. SMARCC2 binds to many other ASD risk genes involved in transcriptional regulation. Knockdown (KD) of Smarcc2 in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adolescent mice led to impaired working memory, with largely intact social and anxiety-like behaviors. Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis revealed that the downregulated genes by Smarcc2 KD were enriched in synaptic transmission. Significant reduction of GABA and glutamate-related genes was also found in PFC of Smarcc2-deficient mice by qPCR profiling. In parallel, electrophysiological recordings uncovered the significant impairment of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic currents in PFC pyramidal neurons by Smarcc2 KD. Smarcc2 binds to HDAC2, and Smarcc2 KD reduced global histone acetylation and H3K9ac enrichment at synaptic gene Slc1a3 (EAAT1), Slc6a1 (GAT1), and Slc32a1 (VGAT) promoters. Treatment of Smarcc2-deficient mice with romidepsin, a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, restored H3K9ac level, working memory and synaptic gene expression. These findings highlight the critical role of Smarcc2 in regulating cognitive and synaptic function, suggesting that targeting HDAC could alleviate deficits in Smarcc2-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Heightened Sensitivity to Voice Loudness Changes in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) affects voice and speech production, often resulting in reduced vocal intensity and monotonous speech. Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.

">A Multi-Region Brain Model to Elucidate the Role of Hippocampus in Spatially Embedded Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                Brains excel at robust decision-making and data-efficient learning. Understanding the architectures and dynamics underlying these capabilities can inform inductive biases for deep learning. We present a multi-region brain model that explores the normative role of structured memory circuits in a spatially embedded binary decision-making task from neuroscience. We counterfactually compare the learning performance and neural representations of reinforcement learning (RL) agents with brain models of different interaction architectures between grid and place cells in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, coupled with an action-selection cortical recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that a specific architecture--where grid cells receive and jointly encode self-movement velocity signals and decision evidence increments--optimizes learning efficiency while best reproducing experimental observations relative to alternative architectures. Our findings thus suggest brain-inspired structured architectures for efficient RL. Importantly, the models make novel, testable predictions about organization and information flow within the entorhinal-hippocampal-neocortical circuit: we predict that grid cells must conjunctively encode position and evidence for effective spatial decision-making, directly motivating new neurophysiological experiments.

                Long-term recording of single-neuron membrane voltage dynamics during behavior is highly desirable. Using ElectraOFF, a fully genetically encoded, photostable, high-performance fluorescence voltage indicator, we achieve routine cellular-resolution imaging over tens of minutes, occasionally up to eighty minutes, in behaving mice with minimal signal loss across neuron types and brain regions. This extended recording capability reveals plasticity changes throughout intracranial electrical neuromodulation, highlighting the novel insights enabled by prolonged voltage imaging.

">Neural integration of acoustic statistics enables detecting acoustic targets in noise</a></h4>

              
                Sound detection amidst noise presents an important challenge in audition. Many naturally occurring sounds (rain, wind) can be described and predicted only statistically, so-called sound textures. Previous research has demonstrated the human ability to leverage this statistical predictability for sound recognition, but the neural mechanisms remain elusive. We trained mice to detect vocalizations embedded in sound textures with different statistical predictability, while recording and optogenetically modulating the neural activity in the auditory cortex. Mice showed improved performance and neural encoding if they could sample the statistics longer per trial. Textures with more exploitable structure, specifically higher cross-frequency correlations improved performance, background encoding and vocalization activity. Activating parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons had an asymmetric effect, improving detection and neural encoding of vocalizations for low correlations, and impoverishing them for high cross-frequency correlations. In summary, mice exploit stimulus statistics to improve sound detection in naturalistic background noise, reflected in behavioral performance and neural activity, relying on PV interneurons for temporal integration.

                <p>The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific translating ribosome affinity purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 months) and old (21-24 months) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Intriguingly, genes involved in serotonergic synthesis were upregulated with age in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a devastating disease, often pharmacoresistant and with a high prevalence of 1% worldwide. There are a few disease-modifying therapies; thus, prevention has become a health priority. The overarching goal of this research project is to highlight the system's dynamics at different stages before TLE onset to identify an early shift in network dynamics trajectory toward disease onset. Researchers often investigate collective brain activity by tracking dynamical interactions of the signal recorded at multiple sites. However, these interactions are usually only computed between pairs of brain regions, at the risk of missing simultaneous interactions of three or more areas, an aspect that is crucial in a networked disease such as TLE. We thus propose to track, on a rich dataset of electrophysiological brain signals recorded within the temporal lobe (TL) of adult male Wistar Han rats, the formation and dissolution of high-order informational multiplets in time during distinct natural behaviors in an animal model of TLE. We identified the informational content of the multiplets as synergistic or redundant. Results identified an early transition of synergistic and redundant multiplets ahead of TLE onset with the predominant involvement of four TL brain regions in generating theta (4&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) activity. This shift has been shown predominantly during exploration, a theta-dependent behavior, less during rest and sleep. This specific change suggests a shift in communication from an integrated to a segregated network toward TLE onset.</p>

                <p>Recording the spiking activity from subcellular compartments of neurons such as axons and dendrites during mouse behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging is increasingly common yet remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise, inaccurate region-of-interest (ROI) identification, movement artifacts, and difficulty in grouping ROIs from the same neuron. To address these issues, we present a computationally efficient preprocessing pipeline for subcellular signal detection, movement artifact identification, and ROI grouping. For subcellular signal detection, we capture the frequency profile of calcium transient dynamics by applying fast Fourier transform (FFT) on smoothed time-series calcium traces collected from axon ROIs. We then apply bandpass filtering methods (e.g., 0.05&ndash;0.12&nbsp;Hz) to select ROIs that contain frequencies that match the power band of transients. To remove motion artifacts from <I>z</I>-plane movement, we apply principal component analysis on all calcium traces and use a bottom-up segmentation change-point detection model on the first principal component. After removing movement artifacts, we further identify calcium transients from noise by analyzing their prominence and duration. Finally, ROIs with high activity correlation are grouped using hierarchical or <I>k</I>-means clustering. Using axon ROIs in the CA1 region, we confirm that both clustering methods effectively determine the optimal number of clusters in pairwise correlation matrices, yielding similar groupings to "ground truth" data. Our approach provides a guideline for standardizing the extraction of physiological signals from subcellular compartments during rodent behavior with 2-photon calcium imaging.</p>

Objective of this systematic review was to determine if incentive-based interventions influenced maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Methods We conducted a search in various databases from inception. All incentive-based interventional studies conducted on pregnant women in LMICs were included. Evidence from the included trials was synthesized using risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes between groups receiving incentives and not receiving incentives. The meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and reviewed the collected data to determine its suitability for meta-analysis. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021247681). Results Of the 3,897 records that were identified, 11 met eligibility criteria, all of which exhibited varying degrees of risk of bias, ranging from high to some concerns. Analysis of maternal outcomes across studies revealed no significant differences in the likelihood of delivering at a healthcare facility (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.47) and in frequency of prenatal care (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.12) between intervention and control groups. However, high levels of statistical heterogeneity were observed for both outcomes indicating variability among study results. Similarly, analysis of tetanus vaccine coverage showed no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.08), with moderate statistical heterogeneity observed. Conclusion The maternal and neonatal outcomes examined in this review did not have any significant differences in intervention group when compared to the control group. The interventions to address maternal health concerns need to follow a multifactorial approach. There is a need for extensive primary research studies in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-969/v4?src=rss">Factors influencing patient satisfaction in home care services: A systematic review [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Home care is an extension of hospital services that must be evaluated, coordinated, and educated to ensure proper care and accelerate recovery. The new concept of home care services can save costs and equipment. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Methods This study is a systematic review with PRISMA guidelines using three electronic databases ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. There were 228 articles with duplication reduction to 197 and narrowed down to 73 articles whose titles and abstracts were appropriate, but only 10 articles met the provisions in the full text. Literature search using the keywords Home Care Services AND Satisfaction, then the type of full-text article, in English and a publication period of 10 years. The data extraction process, irrelevant articles such as articles on patient satisfaction in nursing homes and out-of-home care were removed. PROSPERO approved the following research protocol number: CRD42023482315. Result Found factors that influence patient satisfaction with home care services. Conclusion There are fifteen aspects that affect patient satisfaction and two aspects that affect patient satisfaction in general in long-term home care. It is hoped that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospital home care managers to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the methods in the articles vary greatly, which is a deficiency in this systematic review.

                <p>by Anna Zhukova, Olivier Gascuel</p>

Phylodynamics bridges the gap between classical epidemiology and pathogen genome sequence data by estimating epidemiological parameters from time-scaled pathogen phylogenetic trees. The models used in phylodynamics typically assume that the sampling procedure is independent between infected individuals. However, this assumption does not hold for many epidemics, in particular for such sexually transmitted infections as HIV-1, for which contact tracing schemes are included in health policies of many countries. We extended phylodynamic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models with contact tracing (CT), and developed a simulator to generate trees under MTBD and MTBD-CT models. We proposed a non-parametric test for detecting contact tracing in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Its application to simulated data showed that it is both highly specific and sensitive. For the simplest representative of the MTBD-CT family, the BD-CT(1) model, where only the last contact can be notified, we solved the differential equations and proposed a closed form solution for the likelihood function. We implemented a maximum-likelihood program, which estimates the BD-CT(1) model parameters and their confidence intervals from phylogenetic trees. It performed accurate parameter inference on BD and BD-CT(1) simulated data, and detected contact tracing in HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK. Importantly, we showed that not accounting for contact tracing when it is present, leads to bias in parameter estimation with the BD model (overestimation of the becoming-non-infectious rate). This bias is also present, but greatly reduced, when the BD-CT(1) model is used on data where multiple contacts can be notified. Our CT test, MTBD-CT tree simulator and BD-CT(1) parameter estimator are freely available at GitHub (evolbioinfo/treesimulator and evolbioinfo/bdct).

                <p>by Miriam Schnitzerlein, Eric Greto, Anja Wegner, Anna Möller, Oliver Aust, Oumaima Ben Brahim, David B. Blumenthal, Vasily Zaburdaev, Stefan Uderhardt</p>

Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are essential for tissue homeostasis. Their diverse functions, from monitoring interstitial fluids to clearing cellular debris, are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes that reflect their functional status. While current knowledge of macrophage behaviour comes primarily from <i>in vitro</i> studies, their dynamic behavior <i>in vivo</i> is fundamentally different, necessitating a more physiologically relevant approach to their understanding. In this study, we employed intravital imaging to generate dynamic data from peritoneal RTMs in mice under various conditions and developed a comprehensive image processing pipeline to quantify RTM morphodynamics over time, defining human-interpretable cell size and shape features. These features allowed for the quantitative and qualitative differentiation of cell populations in various functional states, including pro- and anti-inflammatory activation and endosomal dysfunction. The study revealed that under steady-state conditions, RTMs exhibit a wide range of morphodynamical phenotypes, constituting a naïve morphospace of behavioral motifs. Upon challenge, morphodynamic patterns changed uniformly at the population level but predominantly within the constraints of this naïve morphospace. Notably, aged animals displayed a markedly shifted naïve morphospace, indicating drastically different behavioral patterns compared to their young counterparts. The developed method also proved valuable in optimizing explanted tissue setups, bringing RTM behavior closer to the physiological native state. Our versatile approach thus provides novel insights into the dynamic behavior of <i>bona fide</i> macrophages <i>in vivo</i>, enabling the distinction between physiological and pathological cell states and the assessment of functional tissue age on a population level.

                <p>by Andreas Bachler, Amanda Padovan, Craig J. Anderson, Yiyun Wei, Yidong Wu, Stephen Pearce, Sharon Downes, Bill James, Ashley E. Tessnow, Gregory A. Sword, Michelle Williams, Wee Tek Tay, Karl H. J. Gordon, Tom K. Walsh</p>

The global reliance on <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) proteins for controlling lepidopteran pests in cotton, corn, and soybean crops underscores the critical need to understand resistance mechanisms. Vip3Aa, one of the most widely deployed and currently effective Bt proteins in genetically modified crops, plays a pivotal role in pest management. This study investigates the molecular basis of Vip3Aa resistance in Australian <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> through genetic crosses, and integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses. We identified a previously uncharacterized gene, LOC110373801 (designated <i>HaVipR1</i>), as potentially important in Vip3Aa resistance in two field-derived resistant lines. Functional validation using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in susceptible lines confirmed the gene’s role in conferring high-level resistance to Vip3Aa. Despite extensive laboratory selection of Vip3Aa-resistant colonies in Lepidoptera, the biochemical mechanisms underlying resistance have remained elusive. Our research identifies HaVipR1 as a potential contributor to resistance, adding to our understanding of how insects may develop resistance to this important Bt protein. The identification of <i>HaVipR1</i> contributes to our understanding of potential resistance mechanisms and may inform future resistance management strategies. Future work should explore the biochemical pathways influenced by <i>HaVipR1</i> and assess its interactions with other resistance mechanisms. The approach utilized here underscores the value of field-derived resistant lines for understanding resistance in agricultural pests and highlights the need for targeted approaches to manage resistance sustainably.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to certain moral dilemmas. This study aims to investigate the dilemmas, occupational and psychological distresses and professional rewards experienced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards and explore their nature and how they are connected. Methods This qualitative descriptive utilized semi-structured interviews with nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results Twelve nurses (8 women, 4 men) with 4 to 21 years of experience participated. Six participants held managerial positions (three head nurses and three deputy head nurses), alongside six staff nurses. Analysis revealed that nurses experienced significant conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they reported substantial rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions Nurses in COVID-19 wards experienced considerable distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges. Leading to feeling of organizational mistrust. However this demanding environment also provided a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly from new interactions. These findings are highlight the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the inherent occupational distress with professional rewards.

                Lin et al. characterize a population of tau-vulnerable neurons in AD. Analysis of gene expression in these neurons reveals dysregulation in major coordinated programs including apoptosis, cell-component disassembly, and regulation of vesicle-mediated transport. These biological processes suggest avenues for therapeutic interventions preventing neuronal loss and degeneration in AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105018">Mutations that prevent phosphorylation of the BMP4 prodomain impair proteolytic maturation of homodimers leading to lethality in mice</a></h4>

              
                Bone morphogenetic protein4 (BMP4) plays numerous roles during embryogenesis and can signal either alone as a homodimer, or together with BMP7 as a more active heterodimer. BMPs are generated as inactive precursor proteins that dimerize and are cleaved to generate the bioactive ligand and inactive prodomain fragments. In humans, heterozygous mutations within the prodomain of BMP4 are associated with birth defects. We studied the effect of two of these mutations (p.S91C and p.E93G), which disrupt a conserved FAM20C phosphorylation motif, on ligand activity. We compared the activity of ligands generated from BMP4, BMP4<sup>S91C</sup>, or BMP4<sup>E93G</sup> in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos and found that these mutations reduce the activity of BMP4 homodimers but not BMP4/7 heterodimers. We generated <i>Bmp4<sup>S91C</sup></i> and <i>Bmp4<sup>E93G</sup></i> knock-in mice and found that <i>Bmp4<sup>S91C/S91C</sup></i> mice die by E11.5 and display reduced BMP activity in multiple tissues including the heart. Most <i>Bmp4<sup>E93G/E93G</sup></i> mice die before weaning and <i>Bmp4<sup>−/E93G</sup></i> mutants die prenatally with reduced or absent eyes, heart, and ventral body wall closure defects. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from <i>Bmp4<sup>S91C</sup></i> and <i>Bmp4<sup>E93G</sup></i> embryos show accumulation of BMP4 precursor protein, reduced levels of cleaved BMP ligand and reduced BMP activity relative to MEFs from wild type littermates. Because <i>Bmp7</i> is not expressed in MEFs, the accumulation of unprocessed BMP4 precursor protein in mice carrying these mutations most likely reflects an inability to cleave BMP4 homodimers, leading to reduced levels of ligand and BMP activity in vivo. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of the BMP4 prodomain is required for proteolytic activation of BMP4 homodimers, but not heterodimers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104859">Inhibition of p38-MK2 pathway enhances the efficacy of microtubule inhibitors in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) are widely used as first- and second-line chemotherapies for various cancers. However, current MTAs exhibit positive responses only in subsets of patients and are often accompanied by side effects due to their impact on normal cells. This underscores an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that enhance MTA efficacy while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the p38 MAPK-MK2 signaling pathway sensitizes cancer cells to MTA treatment. We utilize CMPD1, a dual-target inhibitor, to concurrently suppress the p38-MK2 pathway and microtubule dynamicity. In addition to its established role as an MK2 inhibitor, we find that CMPD1 rapidly induces microtubule depolymerization, preferentially at the microtubule plus end, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and cancer cell invasion in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models. Notably, 10 nM CMPD1 is sufficient to induce irreversible mitotic defects in cancer cells, but not in non-transformed normal cells, highlighting its high specificity to cancer cells. We further validate that a specific p38-MK2 inhibitor significantly potentiates the efficacy of subclinical concentrations of MTA. In summary, our findings suggest that the p38-MK2 pathway presents a promising therapeutic target in combination with MTAs in cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101217">A bacterial regulatory uORF senses multiple classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics</a></h4>

              
                Expression of many bacterial genes is regulated by <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting elements in their 5’ upstream regions (URs). <i>Cis</i>-acting regulatory elements in URs include upstream ORFs (uORFs), short ORFs that sense translation stress that manifests as ribosomes stalling at specific codons within the uORF. Here, we show that the transcript encoding the <i>Escherichia coli</i> TopAI-YjhQ toxin–antitoxin system is regulated by a uORF that we name ‘<i>toiL’</i>. We propose that in the absence of translation stress, a secondary structure in the UR represses translation of the <i>topAI</i> transcript by occluding the ribosome-binding site. Translation repression of <i>topAI</i> leads to premature Rho-dependent transcription termination within the <i>topAI</i> ORF. At least five different classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics relieve repression of <i>topAI</i>. Our data suggest that these antibiotics function by stalling ribosomes at different positions within <i>toiL</i>, thereby altering the RNA secondary structure around the <i>topAI</i> ribosome-binding site. Thus, <i>toiL</i> is a multipurpose uORF that can respond to a wide variety of translation stresses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103340">Primosomal protein PriC rescues replication initiation stress by bypassing the DnaA-DnaB interaction step for DnaB helicase loading at oriC</a></h4>

              
                In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, replisome and replication fork assembly is initiated by DnaB helicase loading at the chromosomal origin <i>oriC</i> via its interactions with the DnaA initiator and the DnaC helicase loader. Upon replication fork arrest, the replisome including DnaB dissociates from the stalled fork. Replication fork progression is rescued by primosomal protein PriA- or PriC-dependent pathway in which PriA and PriC promote reloading of DnaB in different mechanisms. However, the mechanism responsible for rescue of blocked replication initiation at <i>oriC</i> remains unclear. Here, we found that PriC rescued blocked replication initiation in cells expressing an initiation-specific DnaC mutant, in mutant cells defective in DnaA-DnaB interactions, and in cells containing truncated <i>oriC</i> sequence variants. PriC rescued DnaB loading at <i>oriC</i> even in the absence of Rep helicase, a stimulator of the PriC-dependent replication fork restart pathway. These results of in vitro reconstituted assays concordantly suggest that this initiation-specific rescue mechanism provides a bypass of the DnaA-DnaB interaction for DnaB loading by PriC-promoted loading of DnaB to the unwound <i>oriC</i> region. These findings expand understanding of mechanisms sustaining the robustness of replication initiation and specific roles for PriC in the genome maintenance.

                In the current study, we explored the behavioural and cognitive correlates of the transdiagnostic trait ‘compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought’ (CIT) in humans. CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (<i>N</i>=600), we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

                Feeding and reproduction are known to be closely correlated with each other, and the seasonal breeders show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. However, most model animals do not have definite breeding seasonality, and the mechanisms for such feeding behavior remain unclear. Here, we focused on female medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>); they show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, and their condition of breeding season can be experimentally controlled by day-length. We first demonstrated that, among previously reported feeding-related peptides (neuropeptides involved in feeding), agouti-related peptide 1 (<i>agrp1</i>) and neuropeptide y b (<i>npyb</i>) show higher brain expression under the breeding condition than under the non-breeding one. Combined with analysis of <i>agrp1</i> knockout medaka, we obtained results to suggest that long day-induced sexually mature condition, especially ovarian estrogenic signals, increase the expressions of <i>agrp1</i> in the brain, which results in increased food intake to promote reproduction. Our findings advance the understanding of neural mechanisms of feeding behavior for reproductive success.

                Previously, we reconstituted a minimal functional kinetochore from recombinant <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> proteins that was capable of transmitting force from dynamic microtubules to nucleosomes containing the centromere-specific histone variant Cse4 (Hamilton et al., 2020). This work revealed two paths of force transmission through the inner kinetochore: through Mif2 and through the Okp1/Ame1 complex (OA). Here, using a chimeric DNA sequence that contains crucial centromere-determining elements of the budding yeast point centromere, we demonstrate that the presence of centromeric DNA sequences in Cse4-containing nucleosomes significantly strengthens OA-mediated linkages. Our findings indicate that centromeric sequences are important for the transmission of microtubule-based forces to the chromosome.

">Multifaceted brain representation of numerosity across the senses and presentation formats</a></h4>

              
                Humans can extract numerosity from different senses and a variety of context. How and where the brain abstract numerical information from low-level sensory inputs remains debated. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) applied to fMRI data, we comprehensively investigate how the brain represents numerical information (range 2-5) across different modalities (auditory, visual) and formats (sequential, simultaneous; symbolic, non-symbolic). We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway - from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions - that encode specific non-symbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format. RSA further revealed a posterior-to-anterior gradient in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing that the dominant factors influencing distributed numerical representations shifted from sensory modality in the posterior parietal regions to presentation format in the anterior parietal areas. Our study reveals multifaceted organization of numerical processing from various sensory and format inputs.

">Neural connectivity of a computational map for fly flight control.</a></h4>

              
                Nervous systems rely on sensory feature maps, where the tuning of neighboring neurons for some ethologically-relevant parameter varies systematically, to control behavior1,2. Such maps can be organized topographically or based on some computational principle. However, it is unclear how the central organization of a sensory system corresponds to the functional logic of the motor system. This problem is exemplified by insect flight, where sub-millisecond modifications in wing-steering muscle activity are necessary for stability and maneuverability. Although the muscles that control wing motion are anatomically and functionally stratified into distinct motor modules3-7, comparatively little is known about the architecture of the sensory circuits that regulate their precise firing times. Here, we leverage an existing volume of an adult female VNC of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster8,9 to reconstruct the complete population of afferents in the haltere--nature's only biological ''gyroscope''10,11--and their synaptic partners. We morphometrically classify these neurons into distinct subtypes and design split-GAL4 lines that help us determine the peripheral locations from which each subtype originates. We find that each subtype, rather than originating from the same anatomical location, is comprised of multiple regions on the haltere. We then trace the flow of rapid mechanosensory feedback from the peripheral haltere receptors to the central motor circuits that control wing kinematics. Our work demonstrates how a sensory system's connectivity patterns construct a neural map that may facilitate rapid processing by the motor system.

">Increased Complement C4 in a Sparse Neuronal Subset Induces Network-Wide Transcriptomic Alterations in the Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The complement (C) pathway, a vital part of innate immunity, defends against pathogens and supports tissue surveillance. While local activation in the periphery enhances immune protection, dysregulation can trigger a self-amplifying cascade that spreads beyond the initial site, resulting in tissue injury. In the brain, complement proteins regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms of maladaptive propagation may disrupt neural circuits under pathological conditions. Although complement dysregulation is linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, the impact of localized upregulation in a small subset of cells on broader cortical networks remains unclear. To examine this, we overexpressed the schizophrenia (SCZ) risk gene C4 (C4-OE) in approximately 2% of prefrontal cortex neurons in mice using in utero electroporation. Bulk RNA sequencing of microdissected tissue revealed widespread transcriptional changes in a network predominantly comprising untransfected cells. C4-OE induced the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, and neurogenesis, suggesting a response consistent with compensatory remodeling or aberrant plasticity. Co-expression analysis identified a C4b-containing module enriched for dendritic development and cell cycle regulation, indicating alterations in circuit maturation. In contrast, immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting homeostatic suppression in response to sustained complement activity. Comparisons with human SCZ proteomic datasets revealed conserved gene signatures, highlighting the potential of our model to capture disease-relevant mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that sparse C4 overexpression can trigger widespread transcriptional changes across neural circuits, suggesting that local complement dysregulation may spread through cortical networks and drive broader functional disruption.

">Cholinergic disruption of state-dependent retrosplenial layer 1 activity causes temporal associative memory deficit under stress</a></h4>

              
                Memory functions rely on discrete patterns of neuronal activity emerging from individual neurons, their interconnected circuits, and their alignment with global brain states. We show that such patterns are generated by layer 1 inhibitory neurons in the ventral retrosplenial cortex (vRSPL1), whose activity correlated with immobility and specifically contributed to the formation of temporal associative memories. This state-dependent activity was subject to stress-induced cholinergic modulation through muscarinic 1 receptor (M1R) signaling, leading to selective impairments in temporal but not contextual associative memory. Slice studies showed that these effects were likely due to M1R-mediated inhibition of vRSPL1 neurons, transiently disrupting their local connectivity as well as responsiveness to afferent input. Together, we demonstrate a mechanism by which vRSPL1 activity aligned to immobility coordinate the formation of temporal associations. Through its sensitivity to stress-related cholinergic modulation, this mechanism presents vulnerability to traumatic amnesia, especially for temporal details of episodic memories.

                The discovery of genes encoding the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) has enabled detailed exploration of its cell type-specific roles in the brain. LRRC8A (SWELL1) is the essential VRAC subunit. We observed seizure-induced, subunit-specific changes in microglial VRAC expression and investigated its function using conditional knockout (cKO) of LRRC8A in microglia. SWELL1 cKO mice exhibited a male-specific increase in kainate-induced seizure severity yet showed paradoxical neuroprotection against seizure-associated neuronal loss. Mechanistically, SWELL1 deletion led to a cell-autonomous reduction in microglial density and decreased release of VRAC-permeable neuroactive metabolites, including taurine, GABA, and glutamate. Additionally, impaired phagocytic kinetics and reduced lysosomal biogenesis contributed to the observed neuroprotection. These findings reveal novel roles for microglial VRAC in regulating seizure outcomes and microglia-neuron interactions.

                Animals adapt to environments by learning even when experience is limited, which is critical for their survival in nature. However, the relationship between experience richness and learning efficiency remains elusive. Here we investigated this issue using mice eyeblink conditioning with three distinct training paradigms. Surprisingly, 1/9th of sensory pairings than conventional ones were not only sufficient for acquisition of conditioned responses, relying on the activity of deep cerebellar nuclei as usual, but also resulted in more efficient learning. On the other hand, the learning established by limited training was more susceptible for extinction. Modeling of establishment and extinction processes, coupled with experimental validation of the model prediction, unveiled that memories for execution of eyeblink and its suppression are independently formed irrespective of their temporal order.

">Olfactory bulb and cortex activity reflects subjective odor intensity perception rather than concentration</a></h4>

              
                Understanding stimulus intensity processing is fundamental in sensory science, yet this question remains largely unexplored in human olfaction. We investigated how the human olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) process odor concentration versus subjective perceived intensity. We demonstrate that OB-PC network oscillatory dynamics are predominantly driven by perceived intensity, not physical concentration. The OB initially processes and communicates perceived intensity to the PC via early gamma-band oscillations (bottom-up feedback). The PC then refines and sends this percept back to the OB via later beta-band oscillations (top-down feedback), updating the OB's gamma activity for subsequent odorants. Critically, analyses of phase-amplitude coupling and beta burst activity demonstrate that transient beta patterns from the PC update OB gamma activity, providing the OB with an updated internal representation of the odor percept. These results reveal an oscillatory mechanism by which the olfactory system maintains perceptual constancy and adaptability despite fluctuations in environmental odor concentrations.

">Machine Learning Discovers Numerous New Computational Principles Supporting Elementary Motion Detection</a></h4>

              
                Motion direction detection is a fundamental visual computation that transforms spatial luminance patterns into directionally tuned outputs. Classical models of direction selectivity rely on temporal asymmetry, where motion detection arises through either delayed excitation or inhibition. Here, I used biologically inspired machine learning applied to retinal and cortical circuits to uncover multiple novel feedforward architectures capable of direction selectivity. These include mechanisms based on asymmetric synaptic properties, spatial receptive field variations, new roles for pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, and previously unrecognized kinetic implementations. Conceptually, these circuit architectures cluster into eight computational primitives underlying motion detection, four of which are newly discovered. Many of the solutions rival or outperform classical models in both robustness and precision, and several exhibit enhanced noise tolerance. All mechanisms are biologically plausible and correspond to known physiological and anatomical motifs, offering fresh insights into motion processing and illustrating how machine learning can uncover general principles of neural computation.

">Metabolic reprogramming and altered ATP content impair neuroprotective functions of microglia in β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency models</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the GBA gene, which reduce beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, represent the most significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreased GCase activity has also been observed in sporadic PD cases, supporting a broader role for GCase in the poorly understood mechanisms underlying PD etiopathogenesis. While most studies on the relationship between GBA mutations and PD have focused on neurons, evidence suggests that PD pathology promoted by GCase deficiency involves other cell types and, in particular, interactions between neuronal and glial cells. Here, we identify microglia as primary players undergoing significant alterations at early stages of the pathological processes triggered by a GCase impairment. Using both pharmacological and genetic mouse models of GCase deficiency, we observed microglial morphological, transcriptional and metabolic changes. Interestingly, these changes were associated with a cell-specific, significant reduction of microglial ATP levels. When microglial ATP depletion was reproduced in an in vitro system of co-cultured microglial and neuronal cells, the neuroprotective properties of microglia were compromised and neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress was enhanced. These findings underscore the role of microglia in PD pathogenesis and point to a pathogenetic mechanism by which microglial metabolic disturbances leading to ATP depletion enhance neuronal vulnerability to injury and neurodegeneration. This mechanism could be targeted for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating PD risk and counteracting the development of PD pathology.

">Transcranial direct current stimulation over the frontal eye field has no effect on visual search performance</a></h4>

              
                Top-down attention for the goal-directed (de-)prioritization of information is fundamental for successful everyday-life behavior and poses tremendous problems when negatively impacted by disease. Attention-targeting enhancement and rehabilitation attempts using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are therefore of major importance. tDCS-driven excitation of the left frontal eye field (FEF; a key region within fronto-parietal attention networks) has recently been suggested to improve attention-guided visual search with stronger effects for lower baseline performers. Here, we report two preregistered tDCS experiments that tested 1) whether the previously observed visual search improvement could be boosted through stimulation over the allegedly more dominant right FEF and 2) whether tDCS-related visual search improvements might depend on search field size. To this end, in experiments one and two, N=29 and N=31 healthy participants performed a visual search task, in which they searched for an upside-down T amongst upright Ts and Ls within small or large search fields, before and during the application of anodal (excitatory) or sham (control) tDCS over the right or left FEF, respectively. In contrast to previous studies, in both experiments (i.e., independent of stimulation site and search field size) we found neither tDCS-specific (anodal > sham) visual search improvements, nor stimulation-specific baseline dependencies (larger improvements for lower baseline performers were observed in both tDCS conditions, suggesting rather stimulation-unspecific effects like regression to the mean). Together, our results provide evidence against reliable top-down attention-guided visual search improvements through FEF tDCS.

">Maternal immune activation during the lactational period alters offspring behavior, reproductive development, and immune function in mice</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to infection during early life can lead to lasting neurodevelopmental changes. Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) typically assess neurobehavioral alterations in offspring following a prenatal inflammatory challenge. However, MIA effects on offspring can extend to challenges that occur during the lactational period. In the present study, we adapted previous methods focused on rats and challenged nursing C57BL/6J mouse mothers on postnatal day (P)8 with either the bacterial mimetic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (control, i.p.). By exposing only the mother to LPS, this modeled a postpartum infection in the dam. Similar to the rat model, lactational MIA did not detrimentally alter maternal care but induced displays of maternal sickness, as expected. While neonatal offspring behaviors (e.g., huddling, ultrasonic vocalizations, negative geotaxis) were unaffected, significant effects of lactational MIA emerged in juvenile (e.g., social preference, accelerated reproductive milestones) and adult (e.g., mechanical allodynia, prepulse inhibition) offspring. In a separate set of animals, the developmental programming potential of lactational MIA on immune function was evident following a second-hit LPS challenge in adulthood (e.g., altered plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and leukocytes, including neutrophils, and lymphocytes). These findings confirm the generalizability of the lactational MIA model across species and highlight the importance of supporting caregiver health and wellness across the critical nursing period.

">Efficient learning and intrinsic noise filtering in recurrent spiking neural networks trained with e-prop</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Biologically plausible learning rules for neural networks, such as e-prop (eligibility propagation), are essential both for advancing neuromorphic computing and for understanding fundamental mechanisms of learning in animal brains. However, their behavior under different network conditions remains unclear. Approach. Here, we investigate the performance of the e-prop learning algorithm in recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) across different levels of recurrent connectivity and input noise using a complex temporal credit assignment task, a supervised classification problem known to be solvable by rodents. Main results. We show that increased sparsity in the recurrent layer significantly enhances learning performance by promoting the generation of more diverse activation patterns. Analysis of the network's evolution further reveals that the e-prop-trained input layer evolves to route distinct inputs to different regions of the recurrent layer while suppressing the contribution of noise. This partially resembles signal routing functions attributed to the thalamus in mammalian sensory systems, providing additional support for the biological plausibility of e-prop. Significance. These findings offer promising insights for efficiency and advantages of biologically inspired training in RSNNs.

">Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease Impacts Protein Abundance</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a relentlessly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disorder associated with widespread aberrant proteomic changes. The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cell's primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.

                Synaptic plasticity is widely understood to be the basis of learning and memory, but the link between synaptic changes and network properties remains elusive. Here, we use automated search algorithms to obtain thousands of excitatory(E)-to-E, E-to-inhibitory(I), IE and II plasticity rules working in cooperation in recurrent spiking networks. We selected these rule quadruplets solely based on their ability to robustly stabilize the networks they were embedded in. Simple forms of memory such as novelty detection appeared to be nigh-unavoidable byproducts of this homeostasis criterion. We further inferred rules that reproduce more complex network functions seen experimentally such as contextual novelty and replay. Co-activity was crucial: most rules were unstable in isolation. Overall, we demonstrate the viability of automated discovery algorithms for synaptic plasticity at scale, and show that relatively simple, unsupervised rules can elicit complex network functions through cooperation.

">Neuronal activity induces aggrecan expression to drive perineuronal net formation in cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity, driven by activity-dependent changes in neuronal connectivity, underlies learning and memory. However, the mechanisms that sustain long-term synaptic stabilization are not well understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are lattice-like extracellular matrix structures that enwrap neurons, are thought to stabilize synapses. However, the mechanisms regulating their formation remain unclear. Here, we found that neuronal activity induces transcription of aggrecan, a core PNN component, which in turn promotes PNN assembly. In primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, pharmacological stimulation of neuronal activity robustly increased aggrecan expression, whereas activity blockade suppressed it. Among the PNN-related genes examined, aggrecan alone exhibited strong activity-dependent transcriptional regulation. Analysis of published in vivo datasets revealed selective upregulation of aggrecan in parvalbumin-positive interneurons following sensory stimulation. This regulation required calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels and was dependent on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling and chromatin remodeling. These findings reveal a novel molecular link between neuronal activity and PNN formation, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the long-term stabilization of neural circuits.

">Sez6L2 autoimmunity induces cerebellar ataxia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Sez6L2 autoantibodies have been reported in patients with subacute cerebellar ataxia, presenting with gait disturbances, frequent falls, slurred speech, and repetitive eye movements. These case studies suggest that autoimmunity against Sez6L2 causes cerebellar damage leading to ataxia. Sez6L2 is a transmembrane protein expressed by most neurons, with the highest levels in the cerebellum. We tested whether immunizing C57BL/6 mice against Sez6L2 could produce an autoimmune response resulting in ataxia symptoms and immune attack on the brain/cerebellum. We found that immunized mice generated significant levels of anti-Sez6L2 antibodies, with IgGs present in the cerebellar parenchyma. Additionally, Sez6L2-immunized mice developed a significant population of Sez6L2-specific T cells targeting two immunodominant epitopes and showed increased CD4+ T cell infiltration into the brain. These mice exhibited mild mobility impairments in open field, wire grid walk, and pole test assays. Our results indicate that an autoimmune response to Sez6L2 in mice can lead to mobility impairments and pathology consistent with human cerebellar ataxia associated with Sez6L2 autoantibodies. This new mouse model should be useful for mechanistic studies on this poorly understood autoimmune disease and for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system in patients with Sez6L2 antibodies.

In some cases, the visual system must overcome ambiguity in visual input during object recognition, such as when an object is partially hidden behind another. Recurrent processing between higher- and lower-order areas is thought to play a role in resolving such ambiguity, enabling the filling in of missing visual information. Here we examined this claim using a novel paradigm in which partial object images appear 'occluded' by an illusory Kanizsa figure, perception of which also depends on recurrent processing by the grouping of Pacmen inducers. If both recognising the partial object and perceiving the illusory shape depend on recurrent processing, object recognition should vary as a function of the presence of illusory shape. Across two behavioural experiments and a separate EEG decoding study, we found no evidence for an interaction between illusion perception and object recognition, and different neural time courses for the illusory figures alone compared to those of the partial objects, which were decoded earlier. Ultimately, our study highlights the robustness of the visual system to solve the identity of the ambiguous object, independently from the processing of different ambiguities occurring at the same time, providing new insights into the mechanisms of recurrence in the early and late stages of information processing and its application to ambiguous object recognition.

">Determinants of visual ambiguity resolution</a></h4>

              
                Visual inputs during natural perception are highly ambiguous: objects are frequently occluded, lighting conditions vary, and object identification depends significantly on prior experiences. However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.

">Seeing through the Static: Reduced Imagery Vividness in Aphantasia is Associated with Impaired Temporal Lobe Signal Complexity</a></h4>

              
                Aphantasia is the inability to experience mental imagery in full wakefulness without any prominent perceptual deficits. Visual aphantasia is associated with differences in distributed brain networks, but its neurobiological underpinnings remain a mystery. We rationalised that aphantasia may arise due to impairments in the top-down control over visual imagination. We expected that this in turn would prevent the brains of aphantasic subjects from differentiating neural activity encoding the contents of imagination from the background noise of resting activity, particularly within the ventral temporal lobes. To test this hypothesis, we re-analysed functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from aphantasics (n = 23) and controls (n = 20) during a simple perception and imagery task. We used two measures of informational complexity to quantify the complexity of the spatial pattern of thresholded BOLD signal in the participants' temporal lobes during visual imagery. This spatial complexity was lower in aphantasics than controls during blocks of imagery, but not during perception (P < 0.05). We then performed dynamic functional connectivity analyses on the same data to demonstrate that the higher-order networks of aphantasics coupled abnormally with the temporal lobes during imagery (P < 0.05). These results provide a novel perspective, reframing aphantasia as an inability of the visual system to selectively activate regions encoding object-specific visual categories above background levels of noise.

">Pre-search attentional focus supports learned suppression in visual search</a></h4>

              
                Salient distractors often capture our attention, disrupting ongoing tasks. Recent studies suggest that, through statistical learning, prior experiences regarding distractor locations can reduce distraction by suppressing their corresponding locations. However, the proactive neural mechanisms supporting this learned suppression remain unclear. Our findings demonstrate that participants learn to suppress locations that are more likely to contain distractors relative to other locations. Using frequency tagging in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, we observed significantly different tagging responses between high- and low-probability locations, along with a general decrease in alpha power (8-12 Hz) prior to search onset. Notably, the higher tagging frequency power at high-probability locations suggests that participants allocated greater attentional focus to these locations in anticipation of the search. These results suggest that anticipatory attentional deployment precedes the suppression of high-probability distractor locations after the onset of visual search.

">From Synapses to Dynamics: Obtaining Function from Structure in a Connectome Constrained Model of the Head Direction Circuit</a></h4>

              
                How precisely does circuit wiring specify function? This fundamental question is particularly relevant for modern neuroscience, as large-scale electron microscopy now enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution across many organisms. To interpret circuit function from such datasets, we must understand the extent to which [measured] structure constrains dynamics. We investigate this question in the drosophila head direction (HD) circuit, which maintains an internal heading estimate through attractor dynamics that integrate self-motion velocity cues. This circuit serves as a sensitive assay for functional specification: continuous attractor networks are theoretically known to require finely tuned wiring, whereas connectomes reveal that biological wiring can be variable and omit key cellular parameters such as synaptic gains, neuronal thresholds, and time constants. We introduce a method that combines self-supervised and unsupervised learning objectives to estimate unknown parameters at the level of cell types, rather than individual neurons and synapses. Given the raw connectivity matrix, our approach recovers a network that robustly exhibits continuous attractor dynamics and accurately integrates a range of velocity inputs, despite minimal parameter tuning on a connectome which notably departs from the symmetric regularity of an idealized ring attractor. We characterize how deviations from the original connectome shape the space of viable solutions. We also perform in-silico ablation experiments to probe the distinct functional roles of specific cell types in the circuit, demonstrating how connectome-derived structure, when augmented with minimal, biologically grounded tuning, can replicate known physiology and elucidate circuit function.

">Scikit-NeuroMSI: A Generalized Framework for Modeling Multisensory Integration</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration constitutes a fundamental neural mechanism essential for understanding complex cognitive processes and variations inherent in neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. Although multiple theoretical models exist to account for the computational processes underpinning this mechanism, there is an absence of a consolidated framework that facilitates the examination of multisensory integration across diverse experimental and computational contexts. We introduce Scikit-NeuroMSI, an accessible Python-based open-source framework designed to streamline the implementation and evaluation of neurocomputational models of multisensory integration. The utility of the framework is shown by modeling spatiotemporal causal inference at various analytical levels using Bayesian and network models of multisensory integration, addressing a critical research question of the field. We also offer recommendations for the enhancement of this software and propose directions for future research using this integrative methodology.

">Evaluating the pathogenicity, stability, and stereochemical effects of variants of unknown significance in TREM2 using orthogonal structural analyses</a></h4>

              
                Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), an immune receptor expressed on the surface of microglia, has been identified through genome-wide association studies to be one of the risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies have also identified missense variants of TREM2 to be associated with frontotemporal dementia and Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD). To date, 51 novel missense variants of TREM2 have been identified in the literature, with the disease risk profiles of most variants still unknown. Assessing and classifying the pathogenicity of these variants is essential to investigate the disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments. Herein, we classified 32 missense variants involved in TREM2 using structural bioinformatic data with AlphaFold2. Using the protocol described in our previous work (Pillai et al., 2025), we determined the structural, stability, and potential functional effects of these variants. Our evaluations of the mutations were divided into those (i) implicated in NHD, (ii) located on the transmembrane domain, (iii) surface of the IgV-like domain, and (iii) buried in the receptor. Our analysis of variants involved in NHD suggests that, while V126G imposes the greatest effects, the T66M variant exerts significantly less effects on the TREM2 structures compared to the other remaining variants. Variants in the transmembrane domain of TREM2 did not impose significant alterations to the three-dimensional structure. Outside of known variants in the IgV-like domain, we identified 10 variants that imposed significant destabilizing effects to the structure and are of potential interest. Overall, the baseline biochemical data provided from this study may be informative to experimental efforts to better classify rare coding variants of TREM2 that are of unknown biological and clinical significance.

">Perinatal fluoxetine exposure increases male rat sexual behavior</a></h4>

              
                Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to pregnant women due to their efficacy and safety profile, leading to potential exposure of the developing fetus and infant. Serotonin, which acts as a neurotransmitter in adults and is crucial for regulating male sexual behavior, also serves as a neurotrophic factor during early brain development. Yet, the long-term consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure on adult sexual functioning remain poorly understood. This study investigates the long-term effects of perinatal SSRI exposure on the sexual behavior of adult male rats in a seminatural environment. During pregnancy and lactating, mother rats were administered either fluoxetine (FLX, 10 mg/kg) or a control solution (CTR, 1% Methylcellulose) daily via oral gavage. Upon reaching adulthood, male offspring were assessed for sexual performance in a semi-natural setting, where they lived in mixed-sex groups for eight days. Comprehensive observations of sexual, social, and conflict behaviors were scoring from the first to the last copulatory behavior during the period in which female rats were sexually receptive. Our findings reveal that perinatal FLX exposure significantly increases sexual behavior in adult male rats, as evidenced by a higher total number of copulatory behaviors. This suggests that elevated serotonin levels during early development have enduring consequences for male rat sexual behavior in adulthood, potentially enhancing reproductive strategies and success in naturalistic environments.

                <p>How does the brain process 3D motion? We focused on the human motion complex (hMT+), extending insights from monkey studies. Using 3D-motion stimuli containing perspective and/or stereoscopic cues, we investigated the hierarchy within the motion complex in humans of both sexes to understand the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception. On each trial we decoded 3D motion direction (toward/away) based on the BOLD response in primary visual cortex (V1), and regions within hMT+ including the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas, and the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST). We found that 3D-motion direction could be reliably decoded from all four areas but accuracy depended on cue content. MT and FST showed greatest decoding accuracy with perspective and stereoscopic cues, respectively. Decoding of motion direction in V1 and MST could be explained by retinotopic biases in the BOLD response to motion stimuli. MT and FST were less impacted by such biases. We also identified significant behavioral differences between participants: some were proficient at using stereoscopic cues and others performed near chance. Good behavioral performance with stereoscopic cues was accompanied by better decoding performance in FST but not MT. A control experiment that eliminated 3D motion percepts for stereoscopic stimuli, but not perspective stimuli, revealed that unlike MT, decoding accuracy in FST was influenced by perceptual components of 3D motion. Our findings support that MT and FST play distinct roles in the analysis of visual motion and are key in the transformation of retinal input into perceptual report.</p>

                <p>Direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the medial frontal cortex (MFC) play crucial roles in memory and emotional regulation. Using anterograde transsynaptic tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology in male mice, we document a previously unexplored pathway that parallels the established vHPC-MFC connectivity. This pathway connects the dorsal&ndash;caudal hippocampus (dcHPC) to specific subregions of the ventral MFC (vMFC), in particular the dorsal peduncular cortex. Notably, this pathway exerts a strong inhibitory influence on vMFC by targeting a substantial proportion of inhibitory neurons. Retrograde transsynaptic tracing in male rats indicated that vMFC subregions project disynaptically back to vHPC. These results, altogether, suggest the existence of a remarkable functional circuit connecting distinct functional areas: the cognition-related dcHPC with the emotion-related vMFC and vHPC. These findings further provide valuable insights in the cognitive and emotional abnormalities associated with the HPC-MFC connectivity in neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>A prosocial response to others in distress is increasingly recognized as a natural behavior for many social species. While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed toward familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context, some individuals are more prone to help than others. In a rat helping behavior test where animals can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer, most rats are motivated and consistently release the trapped rat ("openers"), yet ~30% do not open the restrainer ("nonopeners"). To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural markers were compared between opener and nonopener rats in males and females. Openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door opening compared with nonopeners. Oxytocin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the anterior insula, of openers. Several transcription control pathways were significantly upregulated in openers&rsquo; NAc. Chemogenetically inhibiting paraventricular oxytocin neurons did not significantly impair helping but reduced sociality measures, indicating that helping does not rely solely on oxytocin signaling. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate-early gene c-Fos in males revealed increased activity in openers in prosocial brain regions compared with nonopeners. These include regions associated with empathy in humans (insula, somatosensory, cingulate, and frontal cortices) and motivation and reward regions such as the NAc. These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.</p>

                <p>Fear extinction is critical for decreasing fear responses to a stimulus that is no longer threatening. While it is known that the infralimbic (IL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex mediates retrieval of an extinction memory through projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), IL pathways contributing to extinction learning are not well understood. Given the dense projection from the IL to the substantia innominata&ndash;ventral pallidum (SI/VP), an area that processes aversive and appetitive cues, we compared how the IL-&gt;SI/VP functions in extinction compared with the IL-&gt;BLA pathway in male mice. Using retrograde tracing, we demonstrate that IL projections to the SI/VP originate from superficial [Layer (L)2/3] and deep cortical layers (L5) and that they are denser than IL projections to the BLA. Next, combining retrograde tracing with labeling for the immediate early gene cFos, we show increased activity of L5 IL-&gt;SI/VP output during extinction learning and increased activity of L2/3 IL-&gt;BLA output during extinction retrieval. Then, using in vitro recordings, we demonstrate that neurons in the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway are more excitable during extinction learning than retrieval. Finally, using optogenetics, we inactivate the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway and show that this increases defensive freezing during extinction learning and re-extinction, without affecting memory. Taken together, we demonstrate that the IL-&gt;SI/VP pathway is active during extinction learning, when it constrains the defensive freezing response. We propose that the IL acts as a switchboard operator, increasing IL L5 communication with the SI/VP during extinction learning and IL L2/3 communication with the BLA during extinction retrieval.</p>

                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an acoustically evoked EEG potential that is an important diagnostic tool for hearing loss, especially in newborns. The ABR originates from the response sequence of auditory nerve and brainstem nuclei, and a click-evoked ABR typically shows three positive peaks ("waves") within the first six milliseconds. However, an assignment of the waves of the ABR to specific sources is difficult, and a quantification of contributions to the ABR waves is not available. Here, we exploit the large size and physical separation of the barn owl first-order cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) to estimate single-cell contributions to the ABR. We simultaneously recorded NM neurons&rsquo; spikes and the EEG in owls of both sexes, and found that <f></f> spontaneous single-cell spikes are necessary to isolate a significant spike-triggered average (STA) response at the EEG electrode. An average single-neuron contribution to the ABR was predicted by convolving the STA with the cell&rsquo;s peri-stimulus time histogram. Amplitudes of predicted contributions of single NM cells typically reached 32.9 &plusmn; 1.1 nV (mean &plusmn; SE, range: 2.5&ndash;162.7 nV), or <f></f> (median &plusmn; SE; range from 0.01% to 1%) of the ABR amplitude. The time of the predicted peak coincided best with the peak of the ABR wave II, independent of the click sound level. Our results suggest that individual neurons&rsquo; contributions to an EEG can vary widely, and that wave II of the ABR is shaped by NM units.</p>

                <p>Recent research suggests that the detection of preserved cognitive function can assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). This study investigates EEG signals as indicators of neural activity associated with the processing of transitional probabilities during a learning paradigm in patients with DoC. By examining the sensitivity to transitional probabilities across levels of consciousness, we aim to assess the potential value of this indicator in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. We collected EEG recordings from 51 DoC patients (10 female) and 26 healthy controls (9 female). EEG activity was recorded while participants listened to artificial vocabulary speech sequences before and after the learning phase. Intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) was used to examine differences in neural responses in different learning phases. Results showed that minimally conscious patients showed a significant increase in the word-tracking response after the learning phase, similar to healthy controls. Moreover, their learning-mediated word-rate ITPC difference correlated significantly with their Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score and 6&nbsp;month outcome. However, these correlations were absent in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Crucially, differences in vocabulary ITPC before and after the learning phase effectively discriminated between healthy controls and patients, as well as between minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients. Combining EEG indicators with clinical performance accurately predicted patients&rsquo; prognosis. In conclusion, the language learning paradigm has the potential to contribute to both diagnosis and prognosis in this challenging population, thereby significantly reducing prognostic uncertainty in medical decision-making and benefiting the rehabilitation of DoC patients.</p>

                <p>Although several studies have demonstrated that perceptual discrimination of complex scenes relies on an extended hippocampal posteromedial system, we currently have limited insight into the specific functional and structural properties of this system in humans. Here, combining electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography) and advanced microstructural (multishell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative magnetization transfer) imaging in healthy human adults (30 females/10 males), we show that both theta power modulation of the hippocampus and fiber restriction/hindrance (reflecting axon packing/myelination) of the fornix (a major input/output pathway of the hippocampus) were independently related to scene, but not face, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Conversely, microstructural features of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (a long-range occipitoanterotemporal tract) correlated with face, but not scene, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into the neurocognitive systems underpinning complex scene discrimination, providing novel support for the idea of multiple processing streams within the human medial temporal lobe.</p>

                <p>Comprehension of spoken and written language involves a hierarchical sequence of modality-specific and heteromodal processes. While these have been localized to different regions, modality-selective responses extend beyond them, implicating large-scale network organization in language comprehension. Dimensions of whole-brain connectivity, derived from intrinsic activity, have been proposed as a general organizing framework for cognition. Here, we test their utility in accounting for the spatial distribution of task-evoked activity during language comprehension. We investigated brain activity in human males and females in response to psycholinguistic variables linked to input processing and meaning in a sentence comprehension task presented both visually and auditorily. Macroscale patterns of brain activity were similar across modalities for sentence-level and semantic variables, but effects of orthographic and phonological distance were negatively correlated between modalities. The first dimension, separating heteromodal and unimodal cortices, showed no differences across modalities for sentence processing and semantic variables and opposite effects of word length and orthographic/phonological distance for spoken and written words, supporting the notion that higher-order processing requires heteromodal resources different to those linked to input processing. The second dimension, separating auditory&ndash;motor and visual processes, showed an asymmetry in the recruitment of the unimodal systems&mdash;listening to long and semantically dissimilar words involved stronger recruitment of primary auditory&ndash;motor regions and low visual engagement. These findings show that the language system is organized according to large-scale axes of intrinsic connectivity, with psycholinguistic processes varying systematically along whole-brain dimensions. This supports the view that language comprehension reflects general principles of cortical organization.</p>

                <p>To characterize the function of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> current <I>I</I><SUB>Cl(Ca)</SUB> in mammalian rod photoreceptors, we made patch-clamp recordings from retinal slices of mice (<I>Mus musculus</I>) of both sexes that lack Ano2 (TMEM16B). Depolarizing voltage ramps in solutions blocking K<sup>+</sup> currents elicited a large outward current inhibited by the Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> channel blocker niflumic acid; this current was absent in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods. The membrane potential of <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods was 10&ndash;15&nbsp;mV more depolarized in darkness than WT or <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods, indicating a substantial resting Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> permeability. Rod outer-segment photocurrents were similar in waveform and amplitude in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> and <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods, but photovoltages in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods were nearly doubled. Measurements of light-response reversal potentials in rods with and without Ano2 suggest that the outer-segment conductance is nearly linear with a reversal potential of &ndash;9&nbsp;mV and that <f></f> increases during the light response. Using these results, we estimated <I>E</I><SUB>Cl</SUB> from permeabilized patch recordings of reversal potentials of <I>Cx36<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> rods to have a mean value of &ndash;35&nbsp;mV near the rod resting potential, but other evidence suggests that <I>E</I><SUB>Cl</SUB> may be more positive by as much as 10&ndash;15&nbsp;mV. Thus activation of <I>I</I><SUB>Cl(Ca)</SUB> during the light response would be depolarizing. At dim intensities, the photocurrents of downstream rod bipolar cells were larger and about twice as sensitive in <I>Ano2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> retinas with reduced nonlinearity. These experiments show that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> currents in mammalian rods have more important roles in photoreceptor physiology than previously appreciated.</p>

                <p>Neuropathic pain is one of the most intractable pain conditions associated with tumor growth compressing and damaging nerves. A troublesome hallmark symptom of neuropathic pain is hypersensitivity to innocuous stimuli, known as "tactile allodynia," which is often refractory to currently available analgesics. Diurnal variations in pain hypersensitivity are common in patients with cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are enigmatic. Herein, we report that spinal expression of lipocalin-2 (LCN2) enhances pain sensitivity of NCTC2472 fibrosarcoma-implanted male mice during specific stages of the diurnal cycle. As the tumor grew, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increased in the spinal cord of the mice. Increased IL-6 levels stimulated LCN2 expression in spinal microglia, but this expression was periodically repressed by the circadian clock components REV-ERB&alpha; and REV-ERB&beta;. Notably, intraspinal dorsal horn injection of lentiviral vectors expressing REV-ERB&alpha; or REV-ERB&beta; in tumor-bearing mice alleviated tactile allodynia. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of SR9009, a synthetic agonist of REV-ERBs, also attenuated cancer-induced pain hypersensitivity, accompanied by suppressing spinal LCN2 expression. These results suggest that temporal elevation of LCN2 expression decreases the threshold of tactile pain hypersensitivity induced by tumor growth. We propose that the circadian clock component of REV-ERBs is an effective target for alleviation of cancer-induced tactile allodynia, identifying a new class of analgesic agents.</p>

                <p>Facilitation of visual search by repeated distractor contexts is typically studied employing distractor configurations that are 100% predictive of the target location. Yet, real-world contexts vary in predictivity. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in human participants of either sex to explore how visual search facilitation arises from two distinct processing modes&mdash;contextual guidance and context suppression&mdash;that depend on the predictivity of distractor contexts, comparing repeated distractor arrangements that were either predictive or nonpredictive of target location against a baseline of nonrepeated arrangements. In Experiment 1, we manipulated context predictivity by shifting repeated contexts from predictive to nonpredictive and vice versa, while in Experiment 2, we restricted repeated contexts to one side of the display to assess lateralized effects of the two processing modes. Both types of contexts behaviorally facilitated visual search, but facilitation was larger with predictive contexts. Making predictive contexts nonpredictive reduced the facilitation while rendering nonpredictive contexts predictive failed to produce gains. Half-display predictive contexts facilitated target detection on both sides, while nonpredictive contexts facilitated same-side target detection only. EEG analyses revealed that predictive contexts triggered an early N1pc (guidance signal), followed by an enhanced N2pc (attentional selection) and an increased contralateral delay activity (CDA, indexing working memory processing of the target) in occipitoparietal regions, indicative of contextual guidance boosting the entire processing chain. In contrast, nonpredictive contexts produced only an increased N2pc accompanied by reduced CDA, consistent with context suppression. These differential patterns demonstrate contextual guidance and context suppression to operate as electrophysiologically distinct processing modes.</p>

                <p>Movement-related dynamics in the beta and gamma bands have been studied in relation to motor execution and learning during unimanual movements, but their roles in complex bimanual tasks remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate how beta and gamma activity differs between unimanual and bimanual movements and how these neural signatures evolve during the learning process. Our motor task incorporated varying levels of bimanual interaction: unimanual, bimanual-equal, and bimanual-unequal. Magnetoencephalography data were recorded in healthy participants (<I>N</I> = 43, 27 females) during task performance, and beta and gamma activity was quantified. As expected, increasing task complexity from unimanual to bimanual-equal and then to bimanual-unequal movements resulted in slower and less accurate performance. Across all conditions, significant beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during movement, as well as beta ERS after movement. Bimanual movements exhibited greater beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS compared with unimanual movements. With practice, participants demonstrated faster and more accurate movements, accompanied by enhanced beta ERS responses. Furthermore, learning-related reductions in errors correlated with increases in beta ERS. These findings suggest the distinct behavioral and neural demands of unimanual versus bimanual movements and highlight the important role of beta activity in motor performance and learning.</p>

                <p>The transfer of retinal signals from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1) is modulated by a variety of extraretinal inputs, including extrinsic connections formed by GABAergic neurons in the pretectum (PT) and visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (vTRN), as well as the intrinsic connections of GABAergic dLGN interneurons. In the current study, we determined how GABAergic PT projections to the dLGN and vTRN can influence retinogeniculate transfer using a variety of viral tracing techniques, electron microscopy, in vitro physiological recordings, and optogenetics in male and female mice. We found that the PT provides over 75% of the GABAergic and over 30% of the total synaptic input to the vTRN. Optogenetic activation of PT terminals reduced the firing frequency of vTRN neurons as well as the amplitudes of their postsynaptic responses to V1 input. In the dLGN, synaptic terminals originating from the PT targeted interneurons more frequently than thalamocortical (relay) cells, and optogenetic activation of PT input had a greater impact on interneuron firing frequency compared with relay cells. This cell type-specific impact of PT input to the dLGN resulted in the disinhibition of relay cells and an increase in the amplitude of their postsynaptic responses to retinal input. Taken together, our results indicate that GABAergic PT projections to the visual thalamus serve to boost retinogeniculate transfer via two types of disinhibition, potentially enhancing the flow of visual information to V1 following gaze shifts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e2378242025?rss=1">Decomposing Cognitive Processes in the mPFC during Self-Thinking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Past cognitive neuroscience research has demonstrated that thinking about both the self and other activates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a central hub of the default mode network. The mPFC is also implicated in other cognitive processes, such as introspection and autobiographical memory, rendering elusive its exact role during thinking about the self. Specifically, it is unclear whether the same cognitive process explains the common mPFC involvement or distinct processes are responsible for the mPFC activation overlap. In this preregistered functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 35 male and female human participants, we investigated whether and to what extent mPFC activation patterns during self-reference judgment could be explained by activation patterns during the tasks of other-reference judgment, introspection, and autobiographical memory. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that only in the mPFC were neural responses both concurrently different and similar across tasks. Furthermore, multiple regression and variance partitioning analyses indicated that each task (i.e., other-reference, introspection, and memory) uniquely and jointly explained significant variances in mPFC activation during self-reference. These findings suggest that the self-reference task engages multiple cognitive processes shared with other tasks, with the mPFC serving as a crucial hub where essential information is integrated to support judgments based on internally constructed representations.</p>

                <p>Sleep consists of two alternating states&mdash;rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Neurons adjust their firing activity based on brain state, however, the extent to which this modulation varies across neurons and brain regions remains poorly understood. This study analyzed previously acquired 17-h continuous recordings of single-unit activity and local field potentials in the ventral hippocampal CA1 region, prelimbic cortex layer 5, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala of fear-conditioned rats. The findings indicate that more than half of the neurons fired faster during REM sleep than during NREM sleep, although a notable subset of neurons exhibited the opposite preference, firing preferentially during NREM sleep. During sleep, the overall firing activity of both REM- and NREM-preferring neurons decreased. However, fast network oscillations, including hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), amygdalar high-frequency oscillations, cortical ripples, and cortical spindles, differentially modulated REM- versus NREM-preferring neurons. During wakefulness, REM-preferring neurons fired more slowly but were more intensely activated by SWRs and shock presentations than NREM-preferring neurons. Moreover, during fast network oscillations in sleep, neurons with similar REM/NREM preferences exhibited stronger within- and cross-regional coactivation than those with differing preferences. Conversely, during awake SWRs in fear conditioning sessions, neurons with different REM/NREM preferences showed stronger interregional coactivation than those with similar preferences. These findings suggest that the distinct activity patterns of REM- and NREM-preferring neurons, potentially reflecting different roles in memory, affect local and global networks differently, thereby balancing experience-dependent network modifications with sleep-dependent homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability.</p>

                <p>From lamprey to monkeys, the organization of the descending control of locomotion is conserved across vertebrates. Reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) form a bottleneck for descending commands, receiving innervation from diencephalic and mesencephalic locomotor centers and providing locomotor drive to spinal motor circuits. Given their optical accessibility in early development, larval zebrafish offer a unique opportunity to study reticulospinal circuitry. In fish, RSNs are few, highly stereotyped, uniquely identifiable, large neurons spanning from the midbrain to the medulla. Classically labeled by tracer dye injections into the spinal cord, recent advances in genetic tools have facilitated the targeted expression of transgenes in diverse brainstem neurons of larval zebrafish. Here, we provide a comparative characterization of four existing and three newly established transgenic lines in larval zebrafish. We determine which identified neurons are consistently labeled and offer projection-specific genetic access to subpopulations of RSNs. We showcase transgenic lines that label most or all RSNs (<I>nefma, adcyap1b</I><sup><I>ccu</I>96<I>Et</I></sup>) or subsets of RSNs, including ipsilateral (<I>vsx2, calca</I><sup><I>ccu</I>75<I>Et</I></sup>), contralateral (<I>pcp4a</I><sup><I>ccu</I>97<I>Tg</I></sup>) or all (<I>tiam2a</I><sup><I>y</I>264<I>Et</I></sup>) components of the Mauthner array, or midbrain-only RSNs (<I>s1171tEt</I>). In addition to RSNs, selected transgenic lines (<I>nefma, s1171tEt, calca</I><sup><I>ccu</I>75<I>Et</I></sup>) labeled other potential neurons of interest in the brainstem. For those, we performed in situ hybridization to show expression patterns of several excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters at larval stages as well as glutamatergic expression patterns in juvenile fish. We provide an overview of transgene expression in the brainstem of larval zebrafish that serves to lay a foundation for future studies in the supraspinal control of locomotion.</p>

                <p>by Cheng Xing, Ronald Xie, Gary D. Bader</p>

Electron microscopy (EM) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular structures at the nanoscale. Accurate image segmentation is required for analyzing EM images. While manual segmentation is reliable, it is labor-intensive, incentivizing the development of automated segmentation methods. Although deep learning-based segmentation has demonstrated expert-level performance, it lacks generalizable performance across diverse EM datasets. Current approaches usually use either convolutional or transformer-based neural networks for image feature extraction. We developed the RETINA method, which combines pre-training on the large, unlabeled CEM500K EM image dataset with a hybrid neural-network model architecture that integrates both local (convolutional layer) and global (transformer layer) image processing to learn from manual image annotations. RETINA outperformed existing models on cellular structure segmentation on five public EM datasets. This improvement works toward automated cellular structure segmentation for the EM community.

Queer people are still underrepresented both as STEM researchers and participants, partially due to a dearth of accurate data on this demographic. The lack of consideration for queer identities in data collection and dissemination causes a vicious cycle of exclusion. To address this invisibility, it is important to collect and report data in an inclusive and accurate manner across all areas of research, including in studies that are not specifically focused on queer populations. However, STEM researchers are often unsure of how to properly collect data in a manner that fairly represents queer people. We have developed a list of Ten Simple rules to aid researchers to perform data collection on queer individuals, focusing on study design and data dissemination. We address several issues in queer data, such as language use, dealing with small populations, and balancing demands. We also discuss how to extend this inclusive practice for studies on animal populations. These rules are aimed at anybody surveying populations which may contain queer individuals, including for example research studies and inclusivity surveys for conferences. By providing practical tips, we hope to alleviate insecurity and confusion around this topic.

Time-lapse [-50mm][-4mm]Please expand the first name for author “H. James Choi”.microscopy is a powerful tool to study the biology of bacterial cells. The development of pipelines that facilitate the automated analysis of these datasets is a long-standing goal of the field. In this paper, we describe the <i>OmniSegger</i> pipeline developed as an open-source, modular, and holistic suite of algorithms whose input is raw microscopy images and whose output is a wide range of quantitative cellular analyses, including dynamical cell cytometry data and cellular visualizations. The updated version described in this paper introduces two principal refinements: (i) robustness to cell morphologies and (ii) support for a range of common imaging modalities. To demonstrate robustness to cell morphology, we present an analysis of the proliferation dynamics of <i>Escherchia coli</i> treated with a drug that induces filamentation. To demonstrate extended support for new image modalities, we analyze cells imaged by five distinct modalities: phase-contrast, two brightfield modalities, and cytoplasmic and membrane fluorescence. Together, this pipeline should greatly increase the scope of tractable analyses for bacterial microscopists.

Access to affordable and reliable scientific instrumentation remains a significant barrier to the democratization of healthcare and scientific research. In the field of biotechnology, in particular, the complexity, cost, and infrastructure requirements of many instruments continue to limit their accessibility, especially in resource-limited environments. Despite the recent increase in the development of open-source tools, driven by advances in digital fabrication and electronic prototyping, few of these projects have reached large-scale implementation or validation in real-world settings. Here, we present qByte, an open-source, 8-tube isothermal fluorimeter designed to overcome these barriers by offering a cost-effective ($60) yet production-ready solution. qByte leverages standard digital manufacturing and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly techniques and is designed to be portable, making it ideal for both laboratory and field use. The device has been benchmarked against commercial real-time thermocyclers and spectrophotometers, showing comparable results across four key applications: nucleic acid amplification and detection, including the on-site diagnosis of human parasites in Ghana, analysis of protein activity and stability, genetic construct characterization, and bacterial viability tests. Taken together, our results proved qByte as flexible and reliable equipment for a variety of biological tests and applications, while its affordability and open-source design simplify further development and allow adaptation to the needs of future users.

The reversible epitranscriptomic mark, 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) modification, is implicated in numerous cellular processes, but its role in neural development remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discovered high expression of the m<sup>5</sup>C reader Ybx1 in the developing mouse cortex. To elucidate its role in cortical development, <i>Ybx1</i> was ablated in embryonic cortical neural stem cells (NSCs). Interestingly, conditional knockout (cKO) of <i>Ybx1</i> led to perinatal mortality in mice, along with abnormal cortical development. Cortical progenitor cells lacking <i>Ybx1</i> exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation. Multi-omics analysis identified the target mRNAs of Ybx1, which encode the key cell cycle regulatory proteins converging on cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). Ybx1 was found to regulate the stability of its target transcripts. Both knockdown and overexpression of Ybx1 targets via in utero electroporation confirmed that they mediated Ybx1 regulation of proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. Further analysis showed that the G1 to S phase transition in cortical progenitor cells is delayed in the <i>Ybx1</i> cKO. This study highlights the crucial function of the m<sup>5</sup>C reader protein Ybx1 in promoting cell cycle progression of the embryonic cortical progenitors, essential for proper cortical development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-525/v1?src=rss">Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometric (GC-MS) Revealed Bioactive Constituents of Brassica Oleracea var. Viridis (Collard Greens) Used as Ethnomedicine to Treat Male Infertility in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Medicinal plants play a crucial role in pharmacological research, as many pharmaceutical companies rely on them for raw materials. Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The point of this study was to find out what bioactive compounds might be in the ethanol extract of Collard green leaves and how well they work as antioxidants and may be responsible for their traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder. Ethanol extraction was carried out using a Shimadzu gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for the GC-MS analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for male reproductive health, particularly through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective effects. Consequently, further research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of these bioactive compounds in clinical settings and to establish concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.
