              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08277">Instruction-Tuned Video-Audio Models Elucidate Functional Specialization in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity. However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08511">The Predictive Brain: Neural Correlates of Word Expectancy Align with Large Language Model Prediction Probabilities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive coding theory suggests that the brain continuously anticipates upcoming words to optimize language processing, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in naturalistic speech. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data from 29 participants while they listened to an audio book and assigned predictability scores to nouns using the BERT language model. Our results show that higher predictability is associated with reduced neural responses during word recognition, as reflected in lower N400 amplitudes, and with increased anticipatory activity before word onset. EEG data revealed increased pre-activation in left fronto-temporal regions, while MEG showed a tendency for greater sensorimotor engagement in response to low-predictability words, suggesting a possible motor-related component to linguistic anticipation. These findings provide new evidence that the brain dynamically integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory input to facilitate language comprehension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects using naturalistic speech stimuli, bridging computational language models with neurophysiological data. Our findings provide novel insights for cognitive computational neuroscience, advancing the understanding of predictive processing in language and inspiring the development of neuroscience-inspired AI. Future research should explore the role of prediction and sensory precision in shaping neural responses and further refine models of language processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08599">Geometric Hyperscanning under Active Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-person neuroscience holds social cognition as embodied meaning co-regulation through reciprocal interaction, modeled here as coupled active inference with affect emerging as inference over identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184">Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08517">Guidelines for Gaze-based Neural Preliminary Diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural disorders refer to any condition affecting the nervous system and that influence how individuals perceive and interact with the world. Traditional neural diagnoses rely on cumbersome, time-consuming, or subjective methods, such as clinical interviews, behavioural observations, or medical imaging. Eye tracking is an attractive alternative because analysing eye movements, such as fixations and saccades, can provide more objective insights into brain function and cognitive processing by capturing non-verbal and unconscious responses. Despite its potential, existing gaze-based studies presented seemingly contradictory findings. They are dispersed across diverse fields, requiring further research to standardise protocols and expand their application, particularly as a preliminary indicator of neural processes for differential diagnosis. Therefore, this paper outlines the main agreed-upon findings and provides a systematisation of knowledge and key guidelines towards advancing gaze-based neural preliminary diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08583">The enteric nervous system is 10 times stiffer than the brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural tissues of the central nervous system are among the softest and most fragile in the human body, protected from mechanical perturbation by the skull and the spine. In contrast, the enteric nervous system is embedded in a compliant, contractile tissue and subject to chronic, high-magnitude mechanical stress. Do neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system display specific mechanical properties to withstand these forces? Using nano-indentation combined with immunohistochemistry and second harmonic generation imaging of collagen, we discovered that enteric ganglia in adult mice are an order of magnitude more resistant to deformation than brain tissue. We found that glia-rich regions in ganglia have a similar stiffness to neuron-rich regions and to the surrounding smooth muscle, of ~3 kPa at 3 $\mu$m indentation depth and of ~7 kPa at 8 $\mu$m depth. Differences in the adhesion strength of the different tissue layers to the glass indenter were scarce. The collagen shell surrounding ganglia and inter-ganglionic fibers may play a key role in strengthening the enteric nervous system to resist the manifold mechanical challenges it faces.

                arXiv:2405.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive psychophysical procedures aim to increase the efficiency and reliability of measurements. With increasing stimulus and experiment complexity in the last decade, estimating multi-dimensional psychometric functions has become a challenging task for adaptive procedures. If the experimenter has limited information about the underlying psychometric function, it is not possible to use parametric techniques developed for the multi-dimensional stimulus space. Although there are non-parametric approaches that use Gaussian process methods and specific hand-crafted acquisition functions, their performance is sensitive to proper selection of the kernel function, which is not always straightforward. In this work, we use a neural network as the psychometric function estimator and introduce a novel acquisition function for stimulus selection. We thoroughly benchmark our technique both using simulations and by conducting psychovisual experiments under realistic conditions. We show that our method outperforms the state of the art without the need to select a kernel function and significantly reduces the experiment duration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04390">In Praise of Stubbornness: An Empirical Case for Cognitive-Dissonance Aware Continual Update of Knowledge in LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.04390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through systematic empirical investigation, we uncover a fundamental and concerning property of Large Language Models: while they can safely learn facts that don't contradict their knowledge, attempting to update facts with contradictory information triggers catastrophic corruption of unrelated knowledge. Unlike humans, who naturally resist contradictory information, these models indiscriminately accept contradictions, leading to devastating interference, destroying up to 80% of unrelated knowledge even when learning as few as 10-100 contradicting facts. To understand whether this interference could be mitigated through selective plasticity, we experiment with targeted network updates, distinguishing between previously used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. We uncover another asymmetry: while sparing frequently-used neurons significantly improves retention of existing knowledge for non-contradictory updates (98% vs 93% with standard updates), contradictory updates trigger catastrophic interference regardless of targeting strategy. This effect which persists across tested model scales (GPT-2 to GPT-J-6B), suggests a fundamental limitation in how neural networks handle contradictions. Finally, we demonstrate that contradictory information can be reliably detected (95%+ accuracy) using simple model features, offering a potential protective mechanism. These findings motivate new architectures that can, like humans, naturally resist contradictions rather than allowing destructive overwrites.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22146">Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

                arXiv:2506.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine fundamental elements of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as well as how to tune them. Concretely, we focus on two different foundational neuronal units utilized in SNNs -- the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and the resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron. We explore key equations and how hyperparameter values affect behavior. Beyond hyperparameters, we discuss other important design elements of SNNs -- the choice of input encoding and the setup for excitatory-inhibitory populations -- and how these impact LIF and RAF dynamics.

                arXiv:2506.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in neuroscience, generally approached using invasive techniques. This study investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at the resolution of individual neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08484">Efficient Fireworks Algorithm Equipped with an Explosion Mechanism based on Student's T-distribution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world problems can be transformed into optimization problems, which can be classified into convex and non-convex. Although convex problems are almost completely studied in theory, many related algorithms to many non-convex problems do not work well and we need more optimization techniques. As a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, the Fireworks Algorithm(FWA) has been widely studied and applied to many real-world scenarios, even including large language model fine-tuning. But the current fireworks algorithm still has a number of problems. Firstly, as a heuristic algorithm, its performance on convex problems cannot match the SOTA results, and can even be said to be unsatisfactory; secondly, the sampling methods (explosion) of most FWA variants are still uniform sampling, which is actually inefficient in high dimensional cases. This work of ours proposes a new student's t-distribution based FWA(TFWA) with a solid theoretical foundation, which fully utilizes the advantage that student's t-distribution can adjust the parameters (degrees of freedom) and thus adjust the exploitation capability. We have fully experimented on mainstream benchmarks CEC2013 and CEC2017, which proves that TFWA not only becomes the strongest variant of the fireworks algorithm, but also achieves results comparable to SOTA on the test set, and its performance is far superior to that of the SOTA algorithm in some scenarios with a large number of extreme points.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08749">Superposed Parameterised Quantum Circuits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline; on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

                arXiv:2506.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys, acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic approximations found.

                arXiv:2506.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered by our probe can mitigate these errors.

                arXiv:2501.04009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning systems excel in complex tasks but often lack transparency, limiting their use in critical applications. Counterfactual explanations, a core tool within eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), offer insights into model decisions by identifying minimal changes to an input to alter its predicted outcome. However, existing methods for time series data are limited by univariate assumptions, rigid constraints on modifications, or lack of validity guarantees. This paper introduces Multi-SpaCE, a multi-objective counterfactual explanation method for multivariate time series. Using non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), Multi-SpaCE balances proximity, sparsity, plausibility, and contiguity. Unlike most methods, it ensures perfect validity, supports multivariate data and provides a Pareto front of solutions, enabling flexibility to different end-user needs. Comprehensive experiments in diverse datasets demonstrate the ability of Multi-SpaCE to consistently achieve perfect validity and deliver superior performance compared to existing methods.

                arXiv:2504.17346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique, which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution, while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence. Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost post-optimization; and (3) achieved better results compared to gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.06) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], higher performance a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1].

                arXiv:2504.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.

                Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Existing insulin therapies manage symptoms but do not fully stabilize blood glucose levels. Schistosoma mansoni infection or its eggs inhibit T1D in rodent models. This study evaluated the antidiabetic effects of Schistosoma mansoni-derived soluble egg antigen (SEA) and glycoproteins (IPSE and Omega-1) in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model. Methods Glycoproteins were designed using in silico methods and synthesized following epitope prediction, antigenicity assessment, and molecular docking analysis. These glycoproteins were administered at doses of 50 μg and 100 μg per rat in a stratified randomized trial comprising eight treatment groups and two control groups, each containing five streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats: SEA (A-B), Omega-13 (C-D), IPSE2-3 (E-H), insulin-only (I), and PBS (J). Blood glucose, weight, IFN-γ, IL-4 levels, and pancreatic histology were assessed. Results In silico analysis of IPSE and Omega-1 showed strong antigenicity (epitopes >0.60), binding energies from -7.9 to -11.9 Kcal/mol, molecular weights of 1261.40–2034.30 Da, and theoretical pI of 8.23–9.70. In vivo, IPSE and Omega-1 significantly reduced glucose (from 5.76–26.16 mmol/L to 3.94–18.92 mmol/L, p < 0.05), promoted weight gain (192.3–235 g to 231.3–250.2 g), and caused mild-moderate pancreatic infiltration. Conclusions These findings suggest that SEA, IPSE, and Omega-1 are promising candidates for novel diabetes therapies, warranting further investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-575/v1?src=rss">Generation of human iPSC-derived pancreatic organoids to study pancreas development and disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The pancreas has vital endocrine and exocrine functions that can be affected by life-threatening diseases such as diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Although animal models are essential for understanding pancreatic development and disease, they are limited by their low throughput and major species-specific molecular and physiological differences. Generating 3D in vitro models, such as organoids, that are physiologically relevant is essential for investigating pancreatic development and disease in the human context. However, the production of human stem cell-derived pancreatic organoids with a proper branched architecture and correct patterning of cell domains remains challenging. Here, we successfully developed a protocol that efficiently and reproducibly generated organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by optimizing organoid culture format and media. Our differentiation protocol promotes acinar cell differentiation and generates organoids with branches patterned into the central trunk and peripheral tip domains without relying on animal-derived matrices for organoid culture. This platform opens the door to high-throughput investigations of human pancreatic development in a system that recapitulates the most important aspects of pancreatic tissue architecture. Lastly, we anticipate that this system will contribute to the replacement of animal models used to investigate diseases, such as pancreatic cancer.

                Background Lassa fever (LF) is an endemic and immediately notifiable disease in Liberia, and one laboratory confirmed case constitutes an outbreak. We described the epidemiological characteristics and hospital outcomes of LF cases hospitalized during the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routine LF surveillance data from the 2022-2023 outbreak in Liberia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and log binomial regression to assess the association between epidemiological characteristics and mortality. Results A total of 439 suspected LF cases were reported. The median age was 22 (interquartile range (IQR): 10-33) years and 233 (53%) were females. The median number of days between symptom onset and admission was 4 (IQR 2-7). Of the 439 cases, 416 (95%) were tested for LF and 138 were confirmed with 33% positivity rate. The majority, 95 (69%), of confirmed cases were <30 years, 78 (57%) were females, and 81 (59%) were reported during the dry season (October – March). Contact with rodents, 95 (69%), was the commonest mode of exposure. Fever, 128 (93%), malaise, 121 (88%), headache, 114 (83%) and myalgia, 114 (83%) were the most common clinical presentations. There were 83 (19%) deaths among hospitalized suspected LF cases - 42 deaths (15%) among 278 individuals who tested negative and 41 among confirmed cases with 30% case fatality rate (CFR). Presenting CFR per age group, age 40-49 years accounted for 8/12 (67%) and those aged≥50 reported 5/8 (63%) of the deaths among the confirmed cases. There was no significant association between epidemiological characteristics and LF mortality. Conclusions The outbreak highlighted a high disease burden of LF with young adults disproportionately infected, and mortality, even among those who tested negative for the virus. This underscores the urgent need for preventive measures like vaccines and health education campaigns.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Exercise is commonly prescribed for rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP). This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two novel exercise regimes in the management of RCRSP. Methods Pragmatic randomized controlled equivalence trial with blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Sixty-six participants with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain were enrolled, with Group A (n = 35) receiving a single exercise for shoulder pain (SEiSP) and Group B (n = 31) following the shape-up-my-shoulder exercise program (SUMS). The primary outcomes were Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), global satisfaction, functional Ranges Of shoulder Motion (ROM) and transition rate to shoulder functional program. Results Pre-post-treatment comparisons revealed significant improvements in pain at rest, activity, night, maximum activity level, disability, and ROM (p < 0.0001) in both groups. The observed transition rate into the functional program (FP) was higher in the SUMS group than in the SEiSP group at the 5th week (35.48%, 0%) and the 8th week (100%, 77.14%). There were no significant inter-group differences in the pain or SPADI scores. Conclusion Both exercise interventions significantly improved the clinical outcomes after 12 weeks in patients with RCRSP. However, the transition rate to FP, that is, pain-free functional activity, was higher in the SUMS group. Registration Details: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov . Date of registration: Met QC criteria 06/06/2022. Identification number: NCT05408949.

                Background The digital transformation of higher education has intensified the need to assess and enhance the digital competencies of university faculty. This study analyzed the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting levels of faculty digital competence based on socio-educational variables. The objective was to develop an advanced predictive model, applied to faculty members from the State University of Milagro and the Technical University of Manabí. Methods A quantitative approach was adopted, with a cross-sectional correlational design. Digital competencies were measured using the internationally validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument, structured across six core dimensions. In the predictive phase, nine supervised machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, stochastic gradient descent, artificial neural networks, and Naive Bayes. The models were trained using a dataset comprising 4,154 observations, and their performance was assessed using standard classification metrics: area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). Results Gradient boosting, random forest, and neural network models demonstrated superior predictive performance, particularly at advanced competence levels (B2 and C1). Significant associations were identified between academic level, age, gender, and digital competencies. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes showed limitations in identifying low competence levels (A1), while intermediate levels were often overestimated across several models. Conclusions The findings confirm that machine learning algorithms can accurately predict university faculty digital competencies. Advanced models outperformed traditional ones, especially at higher competence levels. It is recommended to incorporate contextual variables and validate the models in diverse educational settings.

                Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is known to have short-term and long-term effects on individuals. In this study, the researcher investigated the relationship between ACEs, conflict resolution strategies, and relationship satisfaction. Methods The sample was dyadic in nature, and a total of 91 couples participated in the study. The analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis sum test, and multilevel modelling based on the Actor Partner Interdependence Model to study both actor and partner effects. Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire, Romantic Partner Conflict Scale, and Couple Satisfaction Index were used. Results Findings suggested that relationship satisfaction did not differ significantly across different ACE groups. However, specific types of ACEs such as sexual abuse and emotional neglect were found to have a significant impact on relationship satisfaction. Young adults who have experienced childhood sexual abuse/emotional neglect reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction compared to those without these ACEs. The conflict resolution strategy of submission mediated the relationship between emotional neglect and relationship satisfaction. Individuals who underwent emotional neglect reported higher usage of submission during conflicts, which further significantly lowered their relationship satisfaction. Individuals with CSA reported lower usage of submission during conflicts, with no mediating effect of the latter on relationship satisfaction. Interestingly, it was found that partners of individuals who had childhood experiences of parental loss, separation, or divorce showed an increased use of compromise in their relationships and higher relationship satisfaction. Compromise also mediated the relationship between the actor’s childhood experience of parental loss, separation, or divorce and the partner’s relationship satisfaction. Conclusion Relationship satisfaction is influenced significantly by the presence of different types of ACEs, in which conflict resolution strategies also play an important role. These findings have significant implications for understanding the potential long-term effects of ACEs on relationship dynamics.

                Background Indomethacin belongs to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed for treatment of rheumatoid diseases and linked to the development of gastric ulcers in many people. Cranberry is a rich source of polyphenols and flavonoids, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods This study aimed to evaluate the activity of cranberry aqueous extract on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in albino rats. 20 adult male rats were sequentially assigned to four groups of 5 each. The control group consumes distilled water (DW) orally for 15 days. The induction group received a single oral dosage (60 mg/kg) of IND. The omeprazole group got 60 mg/kg of indomethacin as a single oral dose and then 20 mg/kg/day of omeprazole for 15 days. The cranberry group was given a single dose of indomethacin 60 mg/kg orally and subsequently 200 mg/kg/day of cranberry aqueous extract for 15 days. Rats were euthanized on day 15, and gastric tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. Results Cranberry extract considerably ameliorated the severity of indomethacin-induced gastric ulcerations and fixed histological deteriorations. Furthermore, indomethacin-exposed rats treated with cranberry extract exhibited dramatically lower serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers like TNF-α and IL-6, but higher levels of anti-oxidative biomarkers like SOD and GPx. The bioactive flavonoids and polyphenols content of cranberry extract could possibly account for its profound gastroprotective effects. The anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of cranberry extract could be a promising strategy for ameliorating the indomethacin-aggravated gastrotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1487/v3?src=rss">Sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of antibiotic resistance: a focus group study with parents of children under 5 years old, conducted mid-pandemic [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Most antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, largely in children under 5 years old, and often inappropriately. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KABs) towards common childhood infections, antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), among parents of children under 5 years old. The concept of individual sacrifice (forgoing antibiotics—a selective pressure for AMR) to mitigate future societal risk of AMR and how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped views were explored. Methods This qualitative study included three, one-hour, virtual focus groups with mothers from parenting networks across inner-city London and semi-rural England, held mid-pandemic (2020). All had ≥1 child <5 years old. The Framework Method of analysis was used. Parents’ KABs towards antibiotic use/AMR formed the primary outcome, with emphases on their sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of AMR for society, plus how the pandemic influenced views on infection prevention and care. Results Fourteen mothers (groups of six, four, four) participated, with mixed ethnicities, education and employment status. Parent perceptions of their individual child’s immediate need for antibiotics outweighed concerns for any possible future threat of AMR to society. Four key themes were identified: uncertainty around symptoms; impact of socio-cultural background on KAB; poor understanding of how antibiotics/AMR work; and opportunities within the doctor–patient dialogue to shape mindset around AMR. The pandemic influenced views across themes. Conclusion Parents prioritising their child’s perceived, immediate, individual ‘need’ for antibiotics over any future impact of AMR on society highlights a continuing need to engage parents in how to mitigate AMR through appropriate antibiotic use, reducing threat to both their child and others. Framing point-of-care dialogue around antibiotic use/AMR in the present (versus future), drawing on pandemic insights and tailoring according to nuanced socio-cultural influences, may encourage a greater sense of personal agency towards taking action to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

Invasive pests and pathogens are a major driver of biodiversity loss. Some rare species may persist through rapid evolution to tolerate or escape new threats, but representing the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes at the appropriate scale is analytically and computationally challenging. <i>Tillandsia utriculata</i> has been classified as endangered in Florida where its population has decreased significantly due to predation by the invasive Mexican weevil <i>Metamasius callizona</i>. Adult female weevils deposit their eggs in leaves of epiphytic bromeliads, preferentially ovipositing in the largest rosettes. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae consume the core of the rosette, often leading to pre-reproductive death. During the past three decades of predation, the <i>T. utriculata</i> population has shifted to initiating the production of inflorescences (to commence its single attempt at sexual reproduction) at smaller rosette sizes. Importantly, the rosette size at induction is correlated with the number of seeds produced. We have constructed an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of a Florida <i>T. utriculata</i> population over many generations where the minimum rosettes size required to initiate inflorescence production (minimum size of induction or MSI), is an inherited trait. We use the model to explore how predation may have shifted the population’s genetic composition and the impact this has on population viability. Our results show that larger germination rates are required for population viability when weevils are present. Parameter uncertainty analysis revealed that in the presence of weevil predation, only a population with a very high germination rate and a short period of predation would sustain its population for 100 years with sizes similar to simulations without weevil predation. Furthermore, uncertainty analysis showed that the mean MSI of the population decreased over a 100-year period without weevil predation, and this trend was exacerbated by the presence of weevil predation.

Animals optimize behavior by integrating sensory input with motor actions. We hypothesized that coupling thermosensory information with motor output enhances the brain’s capacity to process temperature changes, leading to more precise and adaptive behaviors. To test this, we developed a virtual “thermal plaid” environment where zebrafish either actively controlled temperature changes (sensorimotor feedback) or passively experienced the same thermal fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate that sensorimotor feedback amplifies the influence of thermal stimuli on swim initiation, resulting in more structured and organized motor output. We show that previously identified mixed-selectivity neurons that simultaneously encode thermal cues and motor activity enable the integration of sensory and motor feedback to optimize behavior. These results highlight the role of sensorimotor integration in refining thermosensory processing, revealing critical neural mechanisms underlying flexible thermoregulatory behavior. Our study offers new insights into how animals adaptively process environmental stimuli and adjust their actions, contributing to a deeper understanding of the neural circuits driving goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments.

                <p>by Mingfang Zhang, Raluca Chitic, Sander M. Bohté</p>

Predictive coding is a prominent theoretical framework for understanding hierarchical sensory processing in the brain, yet how it could be implemented in networks of cortical neurons is still unclear. While most existing studies have taken a hand-wiring approach to creating microcircuits that match experimental results, recent work in rate-based artificial neural networks revealed that suitable cortical connectivity might result from self-organisation given some fundamental computational principle, such as energy efficiency. As no corresponding approach has studied this in more plausible networks of spiking neurons, we here investigate whether predictive coding properties in a multi-compartment spiking neural network can emerge from energy optimisation. We find that a model trained with an energy objective in addition to a task-relevant objective is able to reconstruct internal representations given top-down expectation signals alone. Additionally, neurons in the energy-optimised model show differential responses to expected versus unexpected stimuli, qualitatively similar to experimental evidence for predictive coding. These findings indicate that predictive-coding-like behaviour might be an emergent property of energy optimisation, providing a new perspective on how predictive coding could be achieved in the cortex.

                <p>by Paweł Górecki, Alexey Markin, Sriram Vijendran, Oliver Eulenstein</p>

The cophenetic distance is a well-established metric in biology used to compare pairs of trees represented in a vector format. This distance was introduced by Cardona and his co-authors, building on the foundational work of Sokal and Rohlf, which dates back over 60 years. It is widely recognized for its versatility since it can analyze trees with edge weights using various vector norms. However, when comparing large-scale trees, the quadratic runtime of the current best-known (i.e., naïve) algorithm for computing the cophenetic distance can become prohibitive. Recently, a new algorithmic framework with near-linear time complexity has been developed to calculate the distances of a generalized class of cophenetic distances, which are derived from the work of Sokal and Rohlf. This improvement not only allows the cophenetic distance to be utilized in large-scale studies but also enhances the versatility of these studies by incorporating generalized variants of the cophenetic distance. However, the framework is limited to applying only the <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> vector norms, which significantly restricts the versatility of generalized cophenetic distances in large-scale applications. To address this limitation, we present a near-linear time algorithmic framework for computing the generalized cophenetic distances across all <i>L</i><sub>p</sub> vector norms. In our scalability study, we showcase the practical performance of our unrestricted algorithmic framework. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of the generalized cophenetic distances by analyzing the distributions of key components of these distances under various vector norms.

We discuss in this article the creation and organization of a national core facility for bioimage analysis, based on a distributed team. F-BIAS federates bioimage analysts across France and relies on them to deliver services to the researchers of this territory. The main challenge in implementing this structure is to ensure significant scientific value to the analysts, thereby encouraging their active participation and persuading their respective host teams to support their involvement. F-BIAS accomplished this by creating a professional network that mitigates the negative effects of isolation experienced by its members, who are often the sole bioimage analyst within their local teams, and fosters the development of their technical skills. In a second phase we capitalized on F-BIAS to create a virtual, remotely-operating core facility for bioimage analysis, offering consultations and collaborative project services to the scientific community of France. The services are organized so that they also contribute to the technical proficiency of the analysts. To promote the creation of similar structures, we present and discuss here the organization of this nationally distributed bioimage analysis service core, highlighting successes and challenges.

                <p>by William R. Cannon, Ethan King, Katherine A. Huening, Justin A. North</p>

During photoheterotrophic growth on organic substrates, purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacteria like <i>Rhodospirillum rubrum</i> can acquire electrons by multiple means, including oxidation of organic substrates, oxidation of inorganic electron donors (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>), and by reverse electron flow from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. These electrons are stored as reduced electron-carrying cofactors (e.g., NAD(P)H and ferredoxin). The overall ratio of oxidized to reduced cofactors (e.g., NAD(P)+:NAD(P)H), or ’redox poise’, is difficult to understand or predict, as are the cellular processes for dissipating these reducing equivalents. Using physics-based models that capture mass action kinetics consistent with the thermodynamics of reactions and pathways, a range of redox conditions for heterophototrophic growth are evaluated, from conditions in which the NADP+/NADPH levels approach thermodynamic equilibrium to conditions in which the NADP+/NADPH ratio is far above the typical physiological values. Modeling predictions together with experimental measurements indicate that the redox poise of the cell results in large-scale changes in the activity of biosynthetic pathways and, thus, changes in cell macromolecule levels (DNA, RNA, proteins, and fatty acids). Furthermore, modeling predictions indicate that during phototrophic growth, reverse electron flow from the quinone pool is a minor contributor to the production of reduced cofactors (e.g., NAD(P)H) compared to other oxidative processes (H<sub>2</sub> and carbon substrate oxidation). Instead, the quinone pool primarily operates to aid ATP production. The high level of ATP, in turn, drives reduction processes even when NADPH levels are relatively low compared to NADP+ by coupling ATP hydrolysis to the reductive processes. The model, in agreement with experimental measurements of macromolecule ratios of cells growing on different carbon substrates, indicates that the dynamics of nucleotide versus lipid and protein production is likely a significant mechanism of balancing oxidation and reduction in the cell.

                <p>by Zhanhao Zhang, Iryna Zabaikina, Cesar Nieto, Zahra Vahdat, Pavol Bokes, Abhyudai Singh</p>

Random fluctuations (noise) in gene expression can be studied from two complementary perspectives: following expression in a single cell over time or comparing expression between cells in a proliferating population at a given time. Here, we systematically investigated scenarios where both perspectives can lead to different levels of noise in a given gene product. We first consider a stable protein, whose concentration is diluted by cellular growth. This protein inhibits growth at high concentrations, establishing a positive feedback loop. Using a stochastic model with molecular bursting of gene products, we analytically predict and contrast the steady-state distributions of protein concentration in both frameworks. Although positive feedback amplifies the noise in expression, this amplification is much higher in the population framework compared to following a single cell over time. We also study other processes that lead to different noise levels even in the absence of such dilution-based feedback. When considering randomness in the partitioning of molecules between daughters during mitosis, we find that in the single-cell perspective, the noise in protein concentration is independent of noise in the cell cycle duration. In contrast, partitioning noise is amplified in the population perspective by increasing randomness in cell-cycle time. Overall, our results show that the single-cell framework that does not account for proliferating cells can, in some cases, underestimate the noise in gene product levels. These results have important implications for studying the inter-cellular variation of different stress-related expression programs across cell types that are known to inhibit cellular growth.

                <p>by Hannah Waddel, Katia Koelle, Max S. Y. Lau</p>

Phylodynamic models capture joint epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics during an outbreak, providing a powerful tool to enhance understanding and management of disease transmission. Existing phylodynamic approaches, however, mostly rely on various non-mechanistic or semi-mechanistic approximations of the underlying epidemiological-evolutionary process. Previous work by Lau and colleagues has shown that full Bayesian mechanistic models, without relying on these approximations, can enable highly accurate joint inference of the epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics including the unobserved transmission tree. However, the Lau method faces major computational bottlenecks. As the volume of genomic data collected during outbreaks continues to grow, it is crucial to develop scalable yet accurate phylodynamic methods. Here we propose a new Bayesian phylodynamic model, overcoming the major scalability issue in the previous method and enabling a readily deployable, yet accurate, phylodynamic modeling framework. Specifically, we develop a <i>sc</i>alable spatio-temporal phylodynamic framework for inferring the transmission <i>tree</i> (<i>ScITree</i>) and other key epidemiological parameters considering the infinite sites assumption in modeling mutation on the sequence level, in contrast to the Lau method in which mutation was modeled explicitly on the nucleotide level. Our approach features full Bayesian implementation utilizing an exact likelihood to mechanistically integrate epidemiological and evolutionary processes. We develop a computationally-efficient data-augmentation Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, inferring key model parameters and unobserved dynamics including the transmission tree. We assess performance of our method using multiple simulated outbreak datasets. Our results indicate that our method can achieve high inference accuracy, comparable to the performance of the Lau method. Additionally, our method scales significantly more efficiently for large outbreaks, with computing time increasing linearly with outbreak size, compared to the exponential scaling of the Lau method. We also demonstrate our method’s utility by applying our validated modeling framework to a dataset describing a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK. Our results show that our method is able to generate estimates of the transmission dynamics consistent with those from the prior method, further demonstrating the robustness of our new approach. In summary, our method provides a computationally-efficient, highly scalable, accurate modeling framework for inferring the joint spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemiological and evolutionary processes, facilitating timely and effective outbreak responses in space and time. Our method is implemented in our R package <i>ScITree</i>.

                <p>by Gaowei Jin, Joaquín Campos, Yang Liu, Berta Marcó de la Cruz, Shujing Zhang, Mingfu Liang, Kaiyue Li, Xingqiao Xie, Fredrik H. Sterky, Claudio Acuna, Zhiyi Wei</p>

Presynaptic scaffold proteins, including liprin-α, RIM, and ELKS, are pivotal to the assembly of the active zone and regulating the coupling of calcium signals and neurotransmitter release, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the liprin-α2/RIM1 complex, revealing a multifaceted intermolecular interaction that drives the liprin-α/RIM assembly. Neurodevelopmental disease-associated mutations block the formation of the complex. Disrupting this interaction in cultured human neurons impairs synaptic transmission and reduces the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. Super-resolution imaging analysis supports a role for liprin-α in recruiting RIM1 to the active zone, presumably by promoting the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RIM1. Strikingly, the liprin-α/RIM interaction modulates the competitive distribution of ELKS1 and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) in RIM1 condensates. Disrupting the liprin-α/RIM interaction significantly decreased VGCC accumulation in the condensed phase and rendered release more sensitive to the slow calcium buffer EGTA, suggesting an increased physical distance between VGCC and vesicular calcium sensors. Together, our findings provide a plausible mechanism of the liprin-α/RIM complex in regulating the coupling of calcium channels and primed synaptic vesicles via LLPS for efficient synaptic transmission and uncover the pathological implication of liprin-α mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Preclinical models vary in complexity and cost. Traditional 2D cell cultures that are high throughput and cost effective, but lack the complexity of multicellular interactions. Animal models and more complex, but are costly, raise ethical concerns and are not a human model to better understand human disease or response to novel treatments. Human precision cut tissue slice (hPCTS) models bridge this gap, maintaining the architecture and microenvironment of original tissues. This study examines the viability and functionality of hPCTS using different tissue culture formats. Previous studies have cultured hPCTS with gentle agitation, either on an insert or floating in tissue culture medium. More recently the use of a proprietary flow system for hPCTS culture has been explored, aiming to provide a more physiologically relevant environment. CELLBLOKS® provide a commercially available flow system platform designed for cell culture that we adapted to accommodate hPCTS. hPCTS were cultured for 15 days using an organotypic polytetrafluoroethylene Millicell insert, a CELLBLOKS® hydrophilic polyethylene terephthalate flow system plate or without an insert. Viability was assessed through MTS assays, while functionality was determined by measuring urea and albumin secretion across the 15 days in culture. The Millicell inserts maintained higher and more consistent viability and functionality over 15 days. Slices cultured with no inserts showed decreased viability and functionality after 7 days in culture. In contrast, CELLBLOKS® cultured hPCTS showed significantly decreased viability and function after 3 days in culture. This study suggests that while the CELLBLOKS® system shows promise for 2D cell line cultures, Millicell Biopore™ inserts offer a more reliable method for maintaining complex hPCTS cultures, preserving both viability and function. As a viable, human-specific alternative to animal models, hPCTS support the 3Rs and have the potential to reduced and potentially replace the use of animals in preclinical research, improving human disease modelling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-253/v2?src=rss">The relationship between digital transformation and digital literacy - an explanatory model: Systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Digital transformation has been one of the main trends in organizations in recent years, and digital literacy is a critical factor in the success of this transformation. Digital transformation involves the use of digital technologies to improve an organization’s processes, products, and services. For this transformation to be successful, it is necessary for employees to have knowledge of and skills in digital technologies. Digital literacy allows employees to understand technologies and their applications, know how to use them efficiently and safely, evaluate and select the most appropriate digital tools for each task, and be prepared to deal with problems and challenges that arise in the digital environment. This study investigates the relationship between digital transformation and digital literacy through a Systematic Literature Review conducted in accordance with Kitchenham’s guidelines. A total of 54 articles, published from 2018, were analyzed from databases such as Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE and Springer. The results reveal that digital literacy significantly influences the success of digital transformation, particularly in areas such as employee adaptability, innovation capacity, and digital tool integration. Key mediating and moderating factors identified include organizational learning culture, leadership support, ongoing training programs, and technological infrastructure. Based on these findings, an explanatory model was developed that maps the interaction between these variables and their impact on digital transformation outcomes. The study offers practical implications for organizations seeking to enhance their digital maturity: investing in employee digital literacy development, aligning leadership strategies with digital initiatives, and fostering a supportive culture for digital adoption are crucial steps. Thus, this study is relevant because it seeks to understand how digital literacy can impact Digital Transformation in organizations and, through the construction of an explanatory model, allows the identification of variables that influence this relationship by developing strategies to improve the digital literacy of employees in organizations.

<p>We physiologically quantify attentional and emotional dyregulations in combat pilots, following 24 h of sleep deprivation as well as to demonstrate recovery dynamics. Using machine learning, our measures were able to predict the aerial profession of the pilots, suggesting these measures as a potential physiomarker for quantifying attentional and emotional regulations.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Short sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental events. However, it is quite challenging to objectively quantify its impact on human cognitive performance. Thus, we aim to examine the effects of sleep deprivation on physiological measures of emotional and attention regulation, in terms of recovery dynamics among sleep-deprived air force pilots. Ninety-one pilots participated in a sleep deprivation workshop held by an aeromedical center. The Auditory Sustained Attention Test (ASAT) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test were applied to evaluate emotional and attention performance at baseline, post 24-h of sleep deprivation, following recovery of 3- and 8-h of sleep. Machine learning was used to predict the aerial professions based on the physiological measures. The results indicate that 24 h of sleep deprivation induced impairments in both attention and emotional regulation; however, while 3 h of sleep recovery have ameliorated emotional regulation and latency to response inhibition, attention performance required 8 h of sleep to ameliorate the observed 70% impairment. The physiologically measured adverse effects induced by sleep deprivation were distinctive among aerial professions, thus allowing machine learning prediction with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The effects of sleep-deprivation-induced fatigue were detected by the ASAT measures, which may be utilized as an objective, non-invasive physiological measure to quantify emotional and attention regulation. The ability to monitor sleep effects in a fast and accurate manner may be beneficial for the competence assessment of pilots and promote safety, and the differentiation across the aerial professions may potentially improve individual suitability assessment, together with the consequences of sleep deprivation.</p>

                Wu et al. used extracellularly displayed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to label cell-surface proteins (CSPs) of astrocytes and neurons. By mapping CSPs to their origins, they report shared interactions between astrocytes and neurons, as well as extensive interactions of astrocytes with other parenchymal cells. They provide a foundation for exploring astrocyte-neuron interactions in health and disease.

ACC stimulation impairs exploring relevant objects, which is linked to increased uncertainty about previous outcomes. Striatum stimulation improves exploring relevant objects, which is linked to a more efficient updating of relevant feature values.

                Kawashima et al. show, through voltage and neurotransmitter imaging in larval zebrafish, that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus compute action effectiveness during motor learning by associating actions with their outcomes. Each action induces inhibition, then rebound, during which visual outcomes trigger neural spikes conveying action effectiveness, enabling motor learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95897">Assessment of the histone mark-based epigenomic landscape in human myometrium at term pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                The myometrium plays a critical role during pregnancy as it is responsible for both the structural integrity of the uterus and force generation at term. Emerging studies in mice indicate a dynamic change of the myometrial epigenome and transcriptome during pregnancy to ready the contractile machinery for parturition. However, the regulatory systems underlying myometrial gene expression patterns throughout gestation remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated human term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies for transcriptome, enhancer histone mark cistrome, and chromatin conformation pattern mapping. More than thirty thousand putative enhancers with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double positive marks were identified in the myometrium. Enriched transcription factor binding motifs include known myometrial regulators AP-1, STAT, NFkB, and PGR among others. Putative myometrial super enhancers are mostly colocalized with progesterone receptor-occupying sites and preferentially associated with highly expressing genes, suggesting a conserved role of PGR in regulating the myometrial transcriptome between species. In human myometrial specimens, inferred PGR activities are positively correlated with phospholipase C like 2 (<i>PLCL2</i>) mRNA levels, supporting that PGR may act through this genomic region to promote <i>PLCL2</i> expression. PGR overexpression facilitated <i>PLCL2</i> gene expression in myometrial cells. Using CRISPR activation, we assessed the functionality of a PGR putative enhancer 35 kilobases upstream of the contractile-restrictive gene <i>PLCL2</i>. In summary, the results of this study serve as a resource to study gene regulatory mechanisms in the human myometrium at the term pregnancy stage for further advancing women’s health research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101163">Human brain ancestral barcodes</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic CpG methylation ‘barcodes’ were read from 15,000–21,000 single cells from three human male brains. To overcome sparse sequencing coverage, the barcode had ~31,000 rapidly fluctuating X-chromosome CpG sites (fCpGs), with at least 500 covered sites per cell and at least 30 common sites between cell pairs (average of ~48). Barcodes appear to start methylated and record mitotic ages because excitatory neurons and glial cells that emerge later in development were less methylated. Barcodes are different between most cells, with average pairwise differences (PWDs) of ~0.5 between cells. About 10 cell pairs per million were more closely related with PWDs &lt;0.05. Barcodes appear to record ancestry and reconstruct trees where more related cells had similar phenotypes, albeit some pairs had phenotypic differences. Inhibitory neurons showed more evidence of tangential migration than excitatory neurons, with related cells in different cortical regions. fCpG barcodes become polymorphic during development and can distinguish between thousands of human cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106042">A library of lineage-specific driver lines connects developing neuronal circuits to behavior in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord</a></h4>

              
                Understanding developmental changes in neuronal lineages is crucial to elucidate how they assemble into functional neural networks. Studies investigating nervous system development in model systems have only focused on select regions of the CNS due to the limited availability of genetic drivers that target specific neuronal lineages throughout development and adult life. This has hindered our understanding of how distinct neuronal lineages interconnect to form neuronal circuits during development. Here, we present a split-GAL4 library composed of genetic driver lines, which we generated via editing the genomic locus of lineage-specific transcription factors and demonstrate that we can use this library to specifically target most individual neuronal hemilineages in the <i>Drosophila</i> ventral nerve cord (VNC) throughout development and into adulthood. Using these genetic driver lines, we found striking morphological changes in neuronal processes within a lineage during metamorphosis. We also demonstrated how neurochemical features of neuronal classes can be quickly assessed. Lastly, we documented behaviors elicited in response to optogenetic activation of individual neuronal lineages and generated a comprehensive lineage-behavior map of the entire fly VNC. Looking forward, this lineage-specific split-GAL4 driver library will provide the genetic tools needed to address the questions emerging from the analysis of the recent VNC connectome and transcriptome datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101779">Activity-dependent synapse elimination requires caspase-3 activation</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, synapses are initially formed in excess and are later eliminated in an activity-dependent manner. Weak synapses are preferentially removed, but the mechanism linking neuronal activity to synapse removal is unclear. Here, we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 deficiency results in defects in synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Notably, caspase-3 deficiency blocks activity-dependent synapse elimination, as evidenced by reduced engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-β deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.

">Robust Input Disentanglement Through Dendritic Calcium-Mediated Action Potentials</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, living beings encounter a continuous stream of mixed information, which has to be disentangled by the brain to form proper representations. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that the interplay between dendritic calcium-mediated action potentials (dCaAPs) with synaptic plasticity and rewiring can enable single neurons to successfully perform this complex task. Compared to other types of dendritic spikes, dCaAPs exhibit a high triggering threshold, large, but graded spike amplitude, with lower amplitudes for stronger synaptic inputs. We show that these properties enable neurons to successfully learn to represent discrete items from a continuous input stream by facilitating the clustering of synapses with temporally correlated presynaptic activities onto the same dendritic branch. In comparison to NMDA spikes, dendrites generating dCaAPs can form representations of individual items more efficiently, independent of the temporal order of their presentation during learning - whether randomly, sequentially, as part of a random stream of simultaneously shown input items, or even as items with shared properties. Thus, our results provide further evidence about the critical role of dCaAPs for the computational capabilities of single neurons.

">CRISPR-mediated knockdown of oxytocin receptor in extended amygdala reduces stress-induced social avoidance and vigilance</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin receptors (OTR) within the extended amygdala and nucleus accumbens have been implicated in modulating social behaviors, particularly following stress. The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses.

">fMRI BOLD signals in the left angular gyrus and hippocampus are associated with memory precision</a></h4>

              
                Prior functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies examining the neural correlates of retrieval success and precision have reported inconsistent results. Here, we examined the neural correlates of success and precision in a test of memory for spatial location. The present study extended prior findings by employing an experimental design that minimized temporal overlap between mnemonic and visuomotor processing. At study, participants viewed a series of object images, each placed at a randomly selected location on an imaginary circle. At test, studied images were intermixed with new images and presented to the participants. The requirement was to make a covert recognition memory judgment to each image and to attempt to recall its studied location, guessing if necessary. A cue signaling the requirement to make a location memory judgment was presented 4 seconds after image onset. Memory precision was quantified as the angular difference between the studied location and the location selected by the participant. In an analysis that combined the data from the present study and a closely similar prior study, we replicated prior reports that fMRI BOLD activity in the left angular gyrus (AG) and the hippocampus tracks memory precision on a trial-wise basis. Linear mixed effects modeling indicated that the activity in the two regions explained independent sources of variability in these judgments. In addition, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis revealed robust evidence for an item-level reinstatement effect (as indexed by encoding-retrieval overlap) in the left AG that was restricted to items associated with high precision judgments. These findings suggest that the hippocampus and the left AG play non-redundant roles in the retrieval and behavioral expression of high precision episodic memories.

                Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in the stress response and in the regulation of circadian function, as well as cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic and immunological processes. While synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC) are widely used in treating inflammatory disorders, their impact on cognitive functions, which include memory deficits and dysregulation of mood, remains less understood. Here, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with the sGC methylprednisolone (MPL) dysregulates the synaptic proteome and impairs cognitive function in the perirhinal cortex, a region critical for recognition memory and visual perception. Further, we show that synaptic structure and plasticity are altered by MPL treatment, highlighting the mechanisms through which sGCs disrupt mnemonic processing. These results may have broad implications for understanding the cognitive side effects of widely used sGC treatments

">Emergent brain-like representations in a goal-directed neural network model of visual search</a></h4>

              
                Visual search, the act of locating a target among distractors, is a fundamental cognitive behavior and a core paradigm for studying visual attention. While its behavioral properties are well characterized in humans and non-human primates, the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unspecified. To address this gap, we developed a biologically aligned neural network model trained to perform visual search directly from pixels in natural scenes. This model exhibits strong generalization to novel scenes and objects, produces human-like scanpaths, and replicates previously known behavioral biases in humans. By analyzing the internal representations of the model, we found that it naturally develops a retinocentric cue-similarity map and prospective fixation signals, features that closely resemble neural activity in the primate fronto-parietal network. Beyond reproducing known behavior and neural signatures, the model makes testable predictions about the geometry and dynamics of internal representations underpinning cue-driven prioritization, fixation preferences, their perspective memories, and prospective plans. These findings offer a computational framework for understanding visual search and a roadmap for future neurophysiological and behavioral studies.

">Ionic Mechanisms Underlying Bistability in Spinal Motoneurons: Insights from a Computational Model</a></h4>

              
                Spinal motoneurons are the final output of spinal circuits that engage skeletal muscles to generate motor behaviors. Many motoneurons exhibit bistable behavior, alternating between a quiescent resting state and a self-sustained firing mode. This bistability is traditionally attributed to plateau potentials, which are driven by persistent inward currents. This intrinsic property is important for normal movement control, but can become dysregulated, causing motor control deficits, like spasticity. Here, we use a conductance-based single-compartment model to investigate the ionic conductances underlying the bistable behaviour of motoneurons. Our simulations demonstrate that the motoneuron bistability and how its emergence is regulated mainly depends on the interplay between several intrinsic ionic mechanisms. In particular, the calcium-activated nonspecific cation current (ICAN), which is amplified by ICaL and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), primarily drives the plateau potential to sustain bistability. Additional modulation is provided by the persistent sodium current (INaP) and the calcium- dependent potassium current (IKCa). This study provides a mechanistic model of motoneuron bistability, offering insights into its disruption in pathological conditions and setting the stage for future research and therapeutic development.

">Dual effect of alpha-synuclein disease variants on condensate formation</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein is a pre-synaptic protein implicated in synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, where it accumulates in intracellular aggregates termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Recent studies have reported that alpha-synuclein undergoes phase separation to form biomolecular condensates both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Alpha-synuclein condensates are thought to contribute to disease through progressive aggregation. Here we show that specific PD-associated alpha-synuclein variants fail to form biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that only two alpha-synuclein variants associated with familial disease, E46K and E83Q, enhance condensate formation in vitro and in cells. However, variants including A30G, G51D, and A53E fail to form or have reduced levels of condensate formation in cells. The same phenotypes are reflected in the budding yeast model showing differential inclusion formation. In iPSC-derived neurons, the propensity of alpha-synuclein variants to undergo VAMP2-mediated phase separation reflects the level of synaptic enrichment. We show that the intrinsic propensity of alpha-synuclein to form condensates and the ability to bind lipid membranes are important to mediate condensate formation in cells. Our results emphasize that alpha-synuclein pathology follows divergent pathways, with both increased and decreased condensate formation contributing to disease. This study establishes biomolecular condensates as a key intermediate in alpha-synuclein dysfunction, providing a novel foundation for translational research.

">Voluntary movement initiation is associated with cardiac input in Libet's task.</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between motor intention and initiation of voluntary movement remains a fundamental topic in neuroscience, originating from the B. Libet seminal framework introduced in 1983. Libet's paradigm significantly influenced discussions on intentionality, motor control, and free will. However, methodological critiques continue to challenge its interpretations, specifically the accuracy and validity of the 'urge to move' phenomenon. One understudied factor in this debate is the potential influence of interoceptive signals--particularly cardiac activity--in shaping the experience of motor intention and movement initiation. In our study, we addressed this gap by examining whether cardiac signals modulate participants' experience of the 'urge to move', using behavioural and electrophysiological measures in 34 healthy human participants performing Libet's task. Crucially, when participants were asked to report the perceived 'urge to move', their button press timings were predominantly aligned with the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, indicating cardiac modulation of motor intention perception. However, analysing heart evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes as a measure of cardiac input perception, we observed no differences in HEP amplitudes associated with changes in introspective demands during the task in both source and sensor spaces. Our results suggest that implicit perception of cardiac signals biases subjective experience of voluntary action initiation, independent from cortical interoceptive markers. These findings have implications for models of motor preparation, intentionality and the bodily basis of voluntary action, challenging conventional interpretations of motor intention and informing debates on volition and interoception.

">Neural signatures of automatic letter-speech sound integration in literate adults</a></h4>

              
                Automaticity in decoding print is crucial for fluent reading. This process relies on associative memories between letters and speech sounds (LSS) that are overlearned through years of reading practice. While previous neuroimaging studies have identified neural correlates of LSS integration across different stages of reading development, the specific neural signatures underlying automatic LSS integration remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to isolate neural components specifically associated with automatic LSS integration in literate adults. To this end, we developed an artificial script training paradigm in which adult native Finnish speakers were trained to associate novel foreign letters with familiar Finnish speech sounds. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we directly compared the audiovisual processing of newly learned and overlearned LSS associations within the same task, one day after training. Event-related fields (ERFs) and multivariate decoding revealed largely shared neural circuits of audiovisual integration for both types of LSS associations, as evidenced by multisensory interaction and congruency effects. Interestingly, the processing of congruent overlearned audiovisual associations uniquely recruited brain activity in the left parietal cortex during the 235-475 ms time window. Furthermore, temporal generalization analysis of the congruency effects revealed that while both newly learned and overlearned audiovisual associations engaged common neural mechanisms, the newly learned associations were processed systematically more slowly by a few hundred milliseconds. Our study identified the spatiotemporal neural signatures underlying automatized LSS processing, offering insights into neural markers that may help identify levels of reading proficiency.

">Layer 6 is a hub for cholinergic modulation in the mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) densely innervate auditory cortex (ACtx), conveying signals linked to internal brain states and external sensory cues. Several studies have shown that acetylcholine (ACh) rapidly modifies local cortical circuits via nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on layer 1 (L1) inhibitory neurons. BFCN terminals are also abundant in L6, though the mechanisms and functional consequences of cholinergic modulation in deeper cortical layers has received less attention. Here, we performed multi-plex in situ labeling across cortical layers and cell types and found that L6 pyramidal neurons (L6-PNs) were highly enriched in diverse nAChR subunit and muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) transcripts. In vivo optogenetic activation of BFCN axons revealed persistent modulation of regular spiking (RS) units in L2-6 but a rapid phasic activation only in L6. In acute slices, optogenetic activation of BFCN axons elicited fast excitatory post-synaptic potentials via nAChRs in L6-PNs, comparable to responses in L1-INs, and slower inhibitory responses mediated by mAChRs. These findings identify L1 inhibitory neurons and L6 excitatory neurons as two hubs that mediate BFCN modulation of cortical circuits. Transcriptional, synaptic, and local circuit connectivity differences between L1 and L6 hubs may allow BFCN inputs to shape perception and plasticity on distinct timescales.

                The neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) are closely related.

Development of both neuron types requires coordinated expression of transcription factors OTP, SIM1, ARNT2 and POU3F2. However, the exact transcription factors involved in the differential differentiation of the AVP and OXT lineages are yet unknown. We used a publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of the developing mouse hypothalamus to identify gene regulatory networks linked to AVP and OXT neuronal differentiation. We identified RORA, EBF3, FOXP1, FOXP2, and BCL11B as transcription factors with possible relevance for Avp and Oxt MCN divergence. We then modeled developmental gene expression dynamics using computational cell fate mapping. This revealed enrichment of EBF3 and BCL11B in the Avp lineage, while FOXP1 and FOXP2 are enriched in the Oxt lineage. Next, in silico analysis of Avp and Oxt promoters found predicted binding sites for FOXP1 and FOXP2 in the Oxt promoter, suggesting a role in Oxt MCN differentiation. Finally, we validated the role of one candidate (FOXP1) with a heterozygous knockout mouse line. Compared to wild-type littermates, we find decreased AVP and OXT neuron abundance, with OXT neurons disproportionally affected.

">Post-Saccadic Disruption of Semantic Category Information in Naturalistic Scenes</a></h4>

              
                During natural vision, people make saccades to efficiently sample visual information from complex scenes. However, a substantial body of evidence has shown impaired visual information processing around the time of a saccade. It remains unclear how saccades affect the processing of high-level visual attributes - such as semantic category information - which are essential for navigating dynamic environments and supporting complex behavioral goals. Here, we investigated whether/how the processing of semantic category information in naturalistic scenes is altered immediately after a saccade. Through both human behavioral and neuroimaging studies, we compared semantic category judgments (Experiments 1A and 1B) and neural representations (Experiment 2) for scene images presented at different time points following saccadic eye movements. In the behavioral experiments, we found a robust reduction in scene categorization accuracy when the scene image was presented within 50 ms after saccade completion. In the neuroimaging experiment, we examined neural correlates of semantic category information in the visual system using fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We found that scene category representations embedded in the neural activity patterns of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) were degraded for images presented with a short (0-100 ms) compared to a long post-saccadic delay (400-600 ms), despite no corresponding reduction in overall activation levels. Together, these findings reveal that post-saccadic disruption extends beyond basic visual features to high-level visual attributes of naturalistic scenes, highlighting a limitation of visual information processing in the short post-saccadic period before executing the next saccade.

">The link between steady-state EEG and rs-fMRI metrics in healthy young adults: the effect of macrovascular correction</a></h4>

              
                To improve the clinical utility of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), enhancing its interpretability is paramount. Establishing links with electrophysiological activities remains the benchmark for understanding the neuronal basis of rs-fMRI signals. Existing research, while informative, suffers from inconsistencies and a limited scope of rs-fMRI metrics (e.g., seed-based functional connectivity). Phenotypic variables like sex and age are suspected to obscure reliable fMRI-EEG associations. A major contributing factor to these inconsistencies may be the neglect of macrovascular correction in rs-fMRI metrics. Given that macrovascular contributions can inflate rs-fMRI connectivity and power, they may lead to misleading fMRI-EEG associations that do not reflect genuine neuronal underpinnings. In this study, we addressed this by applying macrovascular correction and performing a systematic, inter-participant analysis of multiple rs-fMRI and EEG metrics. Our key findings demonstrate that: 1) Macrovascular correction enhances the relationship between EEG and rs-fMRI metrics and improves model fit in many instances; 2) sex significantly modulates EEG-fMRI associations; 3) EEG complexity is significantly associated with resting-state functional activity (RSFA). This research provides crucial insights into the interplay between rs-fMRI and EEG, ultimately improving the interpretability of rs-fMRI measurements and building upon our prior work linking fMRI and metabolism.

">Unsupervised Phenotyping Reveals Disrupted Neural Firing Characteristics in the Anterior Thalamus and Surrounding Brain Regions Following Third-Trimester Equivalent Alcohol Exposure in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Acute binge-like third-trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure (TTAE) causes apoptosic neurodegeneration in brain regions necessary for spatial learning and memory, such as the anterior thalamus (AT), which encodes context-relevant information, including head direction. While we are beginning to understand the behavioral consequences of this exposure, the neural correlates of spatial cognition deficits are underexplored. Thus, we recorded a mixture of neurons from the AT and surrounding brain regions in mice with TTAE while they freely moved within a controlled environment. To model acute binge-like TTAE, C57BL/6J mice received 2 injections of 2.5 g/kg alcohol (or saline) on post-natal day (PND) 7. Subjects were then left undisturbed until the day of surgery as adults (>PND 60), when they were implanted with silicon or multi-wire arrays. Mice were placed in a circular 40 cm diameter arena under dim red light with 2 LED cues on the walls that rotated on a pseudo-random basis while electrophysiological data was recorded. Following data preprocessing, spike and waveform features were extracted from each putative single spiking unit. These features were reduced utilizing uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Following dimensionality reduction, we used agglomerative hierarchical clustering to find populations of neurons with similar features. Following this, we compared each feature based on treatment and found the features most important to disambiguate TTAEs impact on neural activity. TTAE was associated with decreases in mean firing rate, peak firing rate, rebound index, and tail decay constant, increases in alpha, peak to trough time, and repolarization time, and bidirectional differences as a function of neuronal subtype in burst index and rebound index. This suggests that TTAE produces long-lasting and fundamental differences in spiking features that can be observed in vivo and are amenable to intervention. Together, this dataset provides further clarifying criteria that can be utilized to diagnose and treat FASD.

">Hyperpolarization activated cation channel mediated intrinsic plasticity changes underlie the malleability of with-in cell-type electrophysiological heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Within cell-type neuronal electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic heterogeneity is the norm in the brain. Although generally considered a fixed property within cell-types, this heterogeneity is malleable and declines in regions of the human brain that generate seizures. Building off this foundational work we hypothesize that such plasticity of cell-type heterogeneity, specifically its decline, arises from the shared history of neuronal activity that drive intrinsic plasticity mechanisms in a concerted fashion. To explore this hypothesis we study neuronal activity in two model systems: human cortical slice cultures from patients with epilepsy as well as slices from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and subiculum of rodent kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Biophysical properties and spiking dynamics were characterized using whole-cell patch clamp recordings of layer 2 and layer 3 (L2&3) pyramidal neurons in human slice culture as well as deep layer subicular neurons and layer 5 (L5) mPFC of KA mice. We found a significant decline in biophysical heterogeneity and a reduction in information coding in both the KA and slice culture models. In both these models we found a consistent increase in hyperpolarization activated cation current (HCN) dependent electrophysiological properties, the blockade of which restored electrophysiological heterogeneity and information coding. Our findings demonstrate that within cell-type heterogeneity is malleable, and despite being a complex distributed network property, can be tuned by a single ionic current. These findings emphasize the plasticity of within cell-type heterogeneity, suggesting the potential for targeted interventions to restore neuronal heterogeneity changes that accompany epilepsy and potentially other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.

                Background Vehicle safety and stability are critical in the automotive industry, with aerodynamics playing a key role in enhancing these attributes. Spoilers, when effectively designed, can significantly influence airflow, downforce, and lift. This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of spoilers modeled as airfoils with adjustable trailing edges, aiming to dynamically control aerodynamic forces and improve vehicle stability and performance. Methods Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using ANSYS Fluent® to analyze the impact of varying trailing edge angles (AOTE) on aerodynamic forces. A detailed Tesla vehicle model was created in CATIA™, and simulations were performed across a speed range of 120–350 km/h. The Shear Stress Transport (SST) k–ω turbulence model was employed to ensure accurate flow prediction. A wind tunnel domain and grid independence validation were used to ensure numerical reliability. Boundary conditions included velocity inlets, pressure outlets, and no-slip wall boundaries. Results Adjusting the trailing edge angle produced significant variations in lift and downforce. At an angle of 30°, the negative lift (downforce) increased by up to 36%. At 0°, it increased by up to 17%. During acceleration phases, the controlled generation of positive lift improved aerodynamic efficiency, yielding a total lift increase of up to 15%. The simulated drag coefficient was 0.256, differing by 6% from Tesla’s reported value of 0.24, primarily due to mesh refinement level and geometric simplifications. Conclusions This study demonstrates that a spoiler with a movable trailing edge can significantly enhance vehicle handling, acceleration, and aerodynamic stability by actively modulating lift and downforce. The findings support the integration of active aerodynamic control systems in vehicle design. Future research will focus on control system development and experimental validation under real-world driving conditions.

                Background Previous studies compared the cardiorenal efficacy of these two types of SGLT2 inhibitors; however, the findings are inconsistent and do not reflect the population of Type 2 diabetic Mellitus (T2DM) patients in Indonesia, which ranks fifth globally in the number of diabetic patients. This study aims to evaluate the effects and safety of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on cardiorenal risk factors in T2DM Indonesian patients over a 12-month. Methods This study utilized a multicenter retrospective cohort to evaluate diverse cardiorenal risk factors, encompassing glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) risk, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), alongside the safety profile of SGLT2is. Paired data analysis, comparative analysis between groups, and linear regression were conducted to adjust the confounding. Results Both groups exhibited enhancements in HbA1c, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C). Improvements in BMI, Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), triglycerides, ASCVD risk, and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) were only seen in the dapagliflozin group. The comparative study indicated that dapagliflozin markedly decreased body weight and BMI; however, the results became analogous between groups after correction for confounding variables. No significant differences were observed in the average alteration of HbA1c, FPG, SBP, DBP, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, eGFR, and ASCVD risk values. A comparable safety profile was found between groups. Conclusion Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin provide similar advantages in reducing cardiorenal risk after 12 months of treatment in Indonesian patients with T2DM.

                One important performance metric in healthcare, particularly in Malaysia’s public hospitals, is patient turnaround time (PTAT). It describes the time that passes between receiving a patient’s request or sample and making a diagnosis or treatment decision. To guarantee prompt patient care, efficient treatment planning, and general healthcare quality, PTAT optimization is essential. Delays in public hospitals are often caused by complex procedures and inefficiencies in patient flow, particularly the lack of tracking when patients leave waiting areas. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA methodology to examine existing research on PTAT in healthcare. The findings highlight critical factors affecting PTAT in Malaysian hospitals, emphasizing the need for improved patient tracking systems to enhance operational efficiency and healthcare service delivery. It pinpoints recurring themes, knowledge gaps, and possible improvement opportunities. By knowing the elements driving PTAT, administrators, policymakers, and healthcare professionals can be better equipped to adopt measures for improvement. To overcome PTAT difficulties, our study emphasizes the significance of a real-time patient localization system utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This internet of things (IoT) based solution provides a unified strategy for enhancing turnaround times by enabling the real-time tracking of patient movements. The proposed method aims to achieve a PTAT of less than an hour by reducing waiting times by 35% through the integration of current technologies into a unified system. Achieving this objective would enhance the overall effectiveness of patient treatment and drastically reduce missed visits.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in millions of deaths globally. Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montréal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8 + T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunctions in type I interferon and CD8 + T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.

The epidermis is formed by layers of keratinocytes with increasing levels of differentiation towards the outer skin called skin barrier, which protects our body from environmental stressors and dehydration. When skin barrier is damaged, keratinocyte differentiation is triggered, and terminally differentiated keratinocytes express skin barrier components, achieving skin barrier homeostasis. However, the dynamic and quantitative understanding of how skin barrier homeostasis is achieved remains unknown. To elucidate how keratinocyte differentiation is dynamically affected by skin barrier damage, especially in the presence of infection, we developed a mechanistic model of keratinocyte differentiation by integrating experimental results from 101 manually curated publications. To extract the key regulatory structure of the model, we applied model reduction, called the kernel reduction methodology to obtain the minimal reaction network. The key regulatory structure is characterised by positive feedback with cooperativity between Np63 and Stat3, two master regulators of keratinocyte differentiation. This regulatory structure gives rise to bistable behaviour for the expression of terminal differentiation markers of keratinocytes when the skin barrier is damaged and the extracellular calcium level is varied. We validated the model by confirming it produces the history-dependent and switch-like keratinocyte differentiation observed in in vitro reversibility assays. Analysis of the validated model shows that bacterial infection augments keratinocytes’ sensitivity to skin barrier damage by decreasing the level required for differentiation and de-differentiation. Our results suggest the mechanisms by which skin barrier homeostasis is maintained even when the skin is exposed to fluctuating environments that perturb the barrier composition.

                <p>by Qi Sun, Ling-Hao Xu, Alan A. Stocker</p>

Accurate estimation of heading direction from optic flow is a crucial aspect of human spatial perception. Previous psychophysical studies have shown that humans are typically biased in their estimates of heading directions, but the reported results are inconsistent. While some studies found that humans generally underestimate heading direction (central bias), others observed the opposite, an overestimation of heading direction (peripheral bias). We conducted three psychophysical experiments showing that these conflicting findings may not reflect inherent differences in heading perception but can be attributed to the different sizes of the response range that participants were allowed to utilize when reporting their estimates. Notably, we show that participants’ heading estimates monotonically scale with the size of the response range, leading to underestimation for small and overestimation for large response ranges. Additionally, neither the speed profile of the optic flow pattern nor the response method (mouse vs. keyboard) significantly affected participants’ estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a Bayesian heading estimation model that can quantitatively account for participants’ heading reports. The model assumes efficient sensory encoding of heading direction according to a prior inferred from human heading discrimination data. In addition, the model assumes a response mapping that linearly scales the perceptual estimate with a scaling factor that monotonically depends on the size of the response range. This simple perception-action model accurately predicts participants’ estimates both in terms of mean and variance across all experimental conditions. Our findings underscore that human heading perception follows efficient Bayesian inference; differences in participants reported estimates can be parsimoniously explained as differences in mapping percept to probe response.

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, produces psychotomimetic effects when administered in sub-anesthetic dosages. While previous research suggests that Ketamine alters the excitation/inhibition (E/I)-balance in cortical microcircuits, the precise neural mechanisms by which Ketamine produces these effects are not well understood. We analyzed resting-state MEG data from n = 12 participants who were administered Ketamine to assess changes in gamma-band (30–90 Hz) power and the slope of the aperiodic power spectrum compared to placebo. In addition, correlations of these effects with gene-expression of GABAergic interneurons and NMDA-Rs subunits were analyzed. Finally, we compared Ketamine-induced spectral changes to the effects of systematically changing NMDA-R levels on pyramidal cells, and parvalbumin-, somatostatin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons in a computational model of cortical layer-2/3 to identify crucial sites of Ketamine action. Ketamine resulted in a flatter aperiodic slope and increased gamma-band power across brain regions, with pronounced effects in prefrontal and central areas. These effects were correlated with the spatial distribution of parvalbumin and GluN2D gene expression. Computational modeling revealed that reduced NMDA-R activity in parvalbumin or somatostatin interneurons could reproduce increased gamma-band power by increasing pyramidal neuron firing rate, but did not account for changes in the aperiodic slope. The results suggest that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons may underlie increased gamma-band power following Ketamine administration in healthy volunteers, while changes in the aperiodic component could not be recreated. These findings have implications for current models of E/I-balance, as well as for understanding the mechanisms underlying the circuit effects of Ketamine.

Variation in bacterial composition inside a host is a result of complex dynamics of microbial community assembly, but little is known about these dynamics. To deconstruct the factors that contribute to this variation, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. We found that demographic stochasticity and stationary heterogeneity in the host carrying capacity or bacterial growth rate are insufficient to explain quantitatively the variation observed in our empirical data. Instead, we found that the data can be understood if the host-bacteria system can be viewed as stochastically switching between high and low growth rates phenotypes. This suggests the dynamics significantly more complex than logistic growth used in canonical models of microbiome assembly. We develop mathematical models of this process that can explain various aspects of our data. We highlight the limitations of snapshot data in describing variation in host-associated communities and the importance of using time-series data along with mathematical models to understand microbial dynamics within a host.

Genes do not act in isolation, and the effects of a specific variant at one locus can often be greatly modified by polymorphic variants at other loci. A good example is <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>), which has been inferred to explain much of the flowering time variation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We use a set of 62 <i>flc</i> species-wide mutants to document pleiotropic, genotype-dependent effects for <i>FLC</i> on flowering as well as several other traits. Time to flowering was greatly reduced in all mutants, with the remaining variation explained mainly by allelic variation at the <i>FLC</i> target <i>FT</i>. Analysis of <i>FT</i> sequence variation suggested that extremely early combinations of <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> alleles should exist in the wild, which we confirmed by targeted collections. Our study provides a proof-of-concept on how pan-genetic analysis of hub genes can reveal the true extent of genetic networks in a species.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Moderate-to-late preterm (MLP) infants contribute to the greatest proportion of preterm children with neurodevelopmental impairments. White matter injury (WMI) is common and predicts adverse outcomes in very preterm (VP) infants. However, little is known about white matter abnormality (WMA) in MLP infants. We investigated the burden and distribution of WMA in MLP infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MLP infants were recruited from a randomized trial on neonatal nutrition and a prospective observational cohort in New Zealand, and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) soon after birth and at term-equivalent age (TEA). WMA was manually segmented using an established method. Total and regional WMA volumes and percentage of WMA to total cerebral volume were calculated. Probabilistic WMA maps were generated and compared with WMI in VP infants and term infants with congenital heart disease.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 101 infants (32 females), 40 (39.6%) had WMA on at least 1 scan. In 37 infants with WMA who had both scans, WMA was less visible in 22 (59.5%) or undetectable in 7 (18.9%) infants with a mean reduction of 72.7 ± 207.5 mm<sup>3</sup> in WMA volume from early-life to term. Infants with and without WMA had mostly comparable pregnancy and neonatal characteristics. Probabilistic maps demonstrated a characteristic WMA topology, with most lesions in posterior followed by central and anterior regions. Trigonal areas were vulnerable across neonatal populations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>WMA is much more common in MLP infants than previously reported and occurs in a characteristic topology. WMA may be missed on TEA MRI, and its relationship with outcomes in MLP infants warrants attention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali which also lead to an overall development of floriculture in India.

<p>This study examined the long-term consequences of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) on Executive Functions (EFs) and its association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) were assessed. Results showed significant EF decline in PASC, inversely associated with serum TNF-α levels, persistent beyond 1 year post-infection. Increased levels of TNF-α were observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Beyond the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, survivors often grapple with incapacitating post-infection symptoms, referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC) when persistent beyond 90 days. Cognitive manifestations, encompassing attention, memory, and executive functions (EF), collectively termed brain fog, contribute to functional challenges in PASC. This infection also elicits a long-lasting pro-inflammatory response that persists even after viral clearance, potentially correlated with brain fog. However, it is unclear whether pro-inflammatory responses and cognitive sequelae persist beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Thus, this study sought to investigate the long-term consequences of PASC on EFs as well as a potential association with markers of inflammation. Forty individuals with PASC who passed performance validity testing (PVT) and 40 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent neuropsychological assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment to assess global cognition, Victoria Stroop Test to assess inhibitory control, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test to assess cognitive flexibility, Digit Span Task to assess working memory, and Mackworth Clock Test to assess sustained attention on the Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) toolkit. Serum was assayed for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Results indicate significant EF decline in PASC, inversely correlated with serum TNF-α concentrations, approximately 562 ± 225 days after the onset of infection. Thus, there exists protracted EF decline in PASC, persistent even beyond 1 year after the onset of infection. Increased levels of TNF-α are observed to be associated with poorer executive functioning in PASC.</p>

                Chen et al. demonstrate the mechanisms by which KRASG12D-mutant cancer cells are resistant to ferroptosis. Under the circumstances of highly lactate production, ACAT2 facilitates the lactylation of GCLM at K34, which increases the enzymatic activity of the GCL and increases GSH synthesis, resulting in ferroptosis resistance.

                Xue et al. developed an integrated approach for investigating the physiological role and mechanisms of action for long noncoding haplotype regions. They applied the approach to study a haplotype containing 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms spanning 17.4 kbp, demonstrating substantial blood pressure effects and identifying a long-range chromatin interaction mechanism involved.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103620">Heterozygosity for neurodevelopmental disorder-associated TRIO variants yields distinct deficits in behavior, neuronal development, and synaptic transmission in mice</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variants in <i>TRIO</i> are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability. TRIO uses its two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains to activate GTPases (GEF1: Rac1 and RhoG; GEF2: RhoA) that control neuronal development and connectivity. It remains unclear how discrete <i>TRIO</i> variants differentially impact these neurodevelopmental events. Here, we investigate how heterozygosity for NDD-associated <i>Trio</i> variants – <i>+/K1431M</i> (ASD), <i>+/K1918X</i> (SCZ)<i>,</i> and <i>+/M2145T</i> (bipolar disorder, BPD) – impacts mouse behavior, brain development, and synapse structure and function. Heterozygosity for different <i>Trio</i> variants impacts motor, social, and cognitive behaviors in distinct ways that model clinical phenotypes in humans. <i>Trio</i> variants differentially impact head and brain size, with corresponding changes in dendritic arbors of motor cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons (M1 L5 PNs). Although neuronal structure was only modestly altered in the <i>Trio</i> variant heterozygotes, we observe significant changes in synaptic function and plasticity. We also identified distinct changes in glutamate synaptic release in <i>+/K1431M</i> and <i>+/M2145T</i> cortico-cortical synapses. The TRIO K1431M GEF1 domain has impaired ability to promote GTP exchange on Rac1, but <i>+/K1431M</i> mice exhibit increased Rac1 activity, associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1. Acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in <i>+/K1431M</i> variant cortex. Our work reveals that discrete NDD-associated <i>Trio</i> variants yield overlapping but distinct phenotypes in mice, demonstrates an essential role for Trio in presynaptic glutamate release, and underscores the importance of studying the impact of variant heterozygosity in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101338">Oviductin sets the species-specificity of the mammalian zona pellucida</a></h4>

              
                The zona pellucida (ZP) is vital for species-specific fertilization as this barrier mediates sperm-oocyte binding. Here, we determined whether sperm from distant mammalian orders (Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) could penetrate bovine oocytes by examining the role of bovine oviductal fluid and species-specific oviductal glycoprotein (OVGP1 or oviductin) from bovine, murine, or human sources in modulating the species-specificity of bovine and murine oocytes. Sperm from all the species were found to penetrate intact bovine ovarian oocytes to form hybrid embryos. However, contact with oviductal fluid or bovine, murine, or human OVGP1, conferred the ZP species-specificity, allowing only the penetration of the corresponding sperm regardless of the ZP’s origin. Glycolytic and microstructural analyses revealed that OVGP1 covers the pores present in the ZP and that OVGP1 glycosylation determines sperm specificity. This suggests specific fertilization capacity is acquired in the oviduct through the ZP’s incorporation of specific oviductin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101197">Xist RNA binds select autosomal genes and depends on Repeat B to regulate their expression</a></h4>

              
                <i>Xist,</i> a pivotal player in X chromosome inactivation (XCI), has long been perceived as a cis-acting long noncoding RNA that binds exclusively to the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, <i>Xist</i>’s ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that <i>Xist</i> RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that <i>Xist</i> RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to ~100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. <i>Xist</i> binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human <i>XIST</i> RNA. We find that <i>Xist</i> binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, <i>Xist</i> binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing <i>Xist</i> in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting <i>Xist</i>’s Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the <i>Xist</i> inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that <i>Xist</i> targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100037">Fat body-derived cytokine Upd2 controls disciplined migration of tracheal stem cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated activation and directional migration of adult stem cells are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. <i>Drosophila</i> tracheal progenitors are adult stem cells that migrate posteriorly along the dorsal trunk to replenish degenerating branches that disperse the fibroblast growth factor mitogen. However, it is currently unknown how the overall anterior-to-posterior directionality of such migration is controlled. Here, we show that individual progenitor cells migrate together in a concerted, disciplined manner, a behavior that is dependent on the neighboring fat body. We identify the fat body-derived cytokine, Upd2, in targeting and inducing JAK/STAT signaling in tracheal progenitors to maintain their directional migration. Perturbation of either Upd2 production in fat body or JAK/STAT signaling in trachea causes aberrant bidirectional migration of tracheal progenitors. We show that JAK/STAT signaling promotes the expression of genes involved in planar cell polarity leading to asymmetric localization of Fat in progenitor cells. We provide evidence that Upd2 transport requires Rab5- and Rab7-mediated endocytic sorting and Lbm-dependent vesicle trafficking. Our study thus uncovers an inter-organ communication in the control of disciplined migration of tracheal progenitor cells, a process that requires vesicular trafficking of fat body-derived cytokine Upd2 and JAK/STAT signaling-mediated activation of PCP genes.

">Intrinsic plasticity underlies malleability of network heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brain's composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.

">Altered GluN2A levels reduce the emergence of seizure-like events in a rat model of GRIN2A haploinsufficiency</a></h4>

              
                GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, encoded by the GRIN2A gene, are critical components of excitatory synaptic transmission and are essential for proper brain development and function. Dysregulation of NMDA receptor activity is strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. While excessive GluN2A-mediated signalling can lead to hyperexcitability and seizure generation, loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, which result in reduced GluN2A expression, have also been identified in patients with various forms of epilepsy, including focal epilepsies and epileptic encephalopathies. This paradox highlights the complexity of NMDA receptor contributions to network excitability and suggests that both gain- and loss-of-function mutations can be pathogenic. However, the mechanisms through which reduced GluN2A expression influences seizure susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of reduced and absence of GluN2A on seizure-like activity using in vitro model system. Hippocampal slices were prepared from wild-type littermate controls (Grin2a+/+), heterozygous (Grin2a+/-) and homozygous (Grin2a-/-) transgenic rats and subjected to pro-convulsant conditions to elicit epileptiform-like events. Specifically, we employed three well established in vitro epilepsy models: (i) 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), (ii) zero-magnesium with elevated potassium (0Mg2+/5K+), and (iii) high-potassium (high-K+). Local field potentials were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal layer to quantify interictal and seizure-like activity, by measuring latency to onset, event frequency, and duration. Spectral analyses were also conducted to assess alterations in network dynamics. Our findings reveal that reduced GluN2A expression alters the susceptibility of hippocampal circuits to seizure-like activity in a model-dependent manner. In the 4-AP model, Grin2a-/- slices exhibited a significantly lower frequency of interictal events and a delayed onset of seizure-like activity relative to both wild-type and heterozygous slices. In the 0Mg2+/5K+ model, both Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/- slices displayed reduced seizure susceptibility compared to wild-type. Finally, in the high-K+ model, Grin2a-/- slices showed a reduced incidence of seizure-like events compared to wild-type controls when extracellular potassium concentration was increased to 7.5 mM, although this effect was less apparent at higher concentrations (9.5 mM). These results suggest that partial or complete loss of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors reduces the propensity of hippocampal networks to develop epileptiform activity, potentially by altering intrinsic or synaptic excitability. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how GRIN2A loss-of-function variants may contribute to epilepsy and highlight the need to consider developmental and circuit-level compensations when interpreting the impact of GluN2A disruption.

">Pupil-linked arousal differentially modulates cell-type-specific sensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Arousal is a ubiquitous influence on the brain that fluctuates during wakefulness and modulates sensation and perception. These fluctuations impact membrane potential, cortical state, and sensory encoding, yet prior studies report inconsistent effects, likely due to averaging across heterogeneous cell types. To resolve this, we combined two-photon calcium imaging and pupillometry in awake mice to examine arousal-related activity in excitatory subpopulations of the auditory cortex: intratelencephalic (IT), extratelencephalic (ET), and corticothalamic (CT) neurons. Pupil-linked arousal modulated all cell types through diverse linear and non-linear response motifs. ET neurons showed significant multiplicative and additive gain modulation, with enhanced response magnitude and encoding but reduced frequency selectivity. CT and L2/3 neurons exhibited inverted-U relationships between arousal and both response strength and decoding accuracy, while IT neurons were minimally affected. These patterns closely tracked changes in population-level reliability, revealing a mechanistic link between internal state and the stability of sensory representations.

">Lateral hypothalamus directs stress-induced modulation of acute and psoriatic itch</a></h4>

              
                Stress and anxiety are well-known modulators of both physiological and pathological itch. Acute stress suppresses itch, while chronic stress exacerbates it. These effects are mediated by neural circuits within the brain, though the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of neurons in the stress-sensitive lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in modulating itch. Using neural activity-dependent genetic labeling and chemogenetic tools, we selectively engaged a population of LHA neurons (LHAstress-TRAP neurons) responsive to stress. Transient stimulation of these neurons induced anxiety-like behaviors, conditioned place aversion, and suppressed acute (chloroquine-induced) and chronic (psoriatic) itch. Conversely, the inhibition of the LHAstress-TRAP neurons enhanced acute and chronic itch. Interestingly, LHAstress-TRAP neurons did not respond to acute itch stimuli, but their activity was temporally correlated with scratching episodes in mice with psoriasis. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that these neurons exhibit heightened excitability in psoriatic animals. Anterograde viral tracing demonstrated that LHAstress-TRAP neurons project to brainstem regions implicated in itch modulation, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Furthermore, chemogenetic activation and optogenetic silencing of LHAstress-TRAP axon terminals revealed that bidirectional modulation of itch is primarily mediated through projections to the PAG. Together, these findings identify a previously unrecognized central mechanism by which stress modulates itch, centered on a specific population of LHA neurons and their downstream brainstem targets.

">AAV gene therapy for Cockayne syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive, progressive developmental and neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 30% of cases are caused by mutations in the ERCC8/CSA gene. Patients with CS present with cutaneous photosensitivity, growth failure, shorter life span and a progressive degeneration of the central nervous system. Loss of function mutations in CSA result in deficiencies in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, regulation of RNA Pol II mediated transcription repair of oxidative DNA damage, and mitochondrial metabolism. Currently there are no available therapies for these patients. AAV gene therapy offers an opportunity to address this unmet need. We designed a new AAV vector encoding human CSA under a CBA promoter. We tested the therapeutic efficacy of this AAV9-CSA vector by neonatal ICV injection in the Csa-/-;Xpa-/- mouse model. Treatment with AAV9-CSA resulted in a significant increase in lifespan, and broad distribution of human CSA in the brain and heart. Despite clear therapeutic benefit, we also observed neuroradiological abnormalities, neuropathologic alterations including hypo-myelination, astrocytosis, microgliosis, and likely life limiting transcriptomic alterations in liver at endpoint. Nonetheless, the success of these experiments paves the way for the first in human clinical translation of a gene therapy for CS patients.

">Effects of diffusion MRI spatial resolution on human brain short-range association fiber reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation</a></h4>

              
                Short-range association fibers (SAFs) are critical for cortical communications but are often underestimated in conventional resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) since they locate within a ~1.5mm thin layer of superficial white matter. With the emergence of sub-millimeter diffusion imaging techniques, this study timely evaluated the effects of image spatial resolution on SAF reconstruction using simulation data and multi-resolution (2, 1.5, and 0.96 mm iso.) empirical data acquired on the same 20 healthy subjects using the gSlider sequence and 20 widely used tractography approaches. Resolution effects were qualitatively assessed through model fitting and tractography results and quantitatively evaluated using global and regional short-range connectivity strength (SCS). It is found that lower resolution systematically reduced SCS across all methods in a spatially varying way. Moreover, tractography methods exhibited significant differences in resolution sensitivity, with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based single-tissue single-fiber tractography showing greater vulnerability than constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based multi-tissue multi-fiber tractography, and probabilistic tracking with anatomical constraints (ACT) and filtering (SIFT) improved robustness. Finally, up-sampling data to nominally higher resolution partially mitigated resolution-induced degradation and improved SAF reconstruction accuracy, particularly for DTI tractography. Based on these findings, higher resolution and multi-shell imaging is recommended if possible. For a given dataset, data up-sampling and DTI-based probabilistic tracking with ACT is recommended for single-shell low b-value data. CSD-based probabilistic tracking with ACT and SIFT is recommended for single-shell higher b-value data and multi-shell data. In summary, this study systematically and quantitatively evaluated resolution effects on SAF reconstruction and structural connectivity estimation and provides practical guidelines for more accurate mapping of SAFs that will improve the characterization of healthy and diseased human brains in a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications.

">Accumulation of LRRK2-associated phospho-Rab12 degenerative lysosomes in tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with endolysosomal dysfunction across cell types, and carriers of LRRK2 mutations variably present with phosphorylated tau and -synuclein deposits in post-mortem analysis. LRRK2 mutations increase the phosphorylation of Rab substrates including Rab12. Rab12 is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal cells with localization to membranes in the endolysosomal compartment. Under lysosomal stress, LRRK2 interaction with Rab12 upregulates LRRK2 kinase activity. In this study, using a recently developed monoclonal antibody directed to the LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation site on Rab12 at amino acid Ser106 (pS106-Rab12), we test whether aberrant LRRK2 phosphorylation is associated with tau and/or -synuclein pathology across clinically distinct neurodegenerative diseases. Analysis of brain tissue lysates and immunohistochemistry of pathology-susceptible brain regions demonstrate that pS106-Rab12 levels are increased in Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In early pathological stages, phosphorylated Rab12 localizes to granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs), which are thought to be active lysosomal-like structures, in neurons. pS106-Rab12-positive GVBs accumulate with pathological tau stage across brain tissues in DLB, AD, and PD, and in LRRK2 mutation carriers. In a mouse model of tauopathy, pS106-Rab12 localizes to GVBs during early tau deposition in an age-dependent manner. While GVBs are largely absent in neurons with mature protein pathology, subsets of both tau and -synuclein inclusions appear to incorporate pS106-Rab12 at later pathological stages. Finally, pS106-Rab12 labels GVBs in neurons and shows widespread co-pathology with tau inclusions in primary tauopathies including Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. These results implicate LRRK2 kinase activity and Rab phosphorylation in endolysosomal dysfunction in both tau and -synuclein-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

">Smelling the Risk: Early Olfactory Deficits, Brain Networks, and Blood Markers of Alzheimers Disease Risk in Humanized APOE Mice</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory impairment is a hallmark of early Alzheimers disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms connecting sensory decline to genetic and environmental risk factors remain unclear. Our integrative analysis combines ethologically relevant olfactory behavior assays, high-resolution diffusion MRI connectomics, and blood transcriptomics in a large cohort of humanized APOE mice stratified by APOE genotype (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4), age, sex, high-fat diet, and immune background (HN). Behaviorally, APOE4 mice exhibited accelerated deficits in odor salience, novelty detection, and memory, especially when exposed to a high-fat diet, whereas APOE2 mice showed resilience (ANOVA: APOE x HN, F(2,1669)=77.25, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.08). Notably, age and diet exerted compounding effects, with older and HFD-fed mice displaying reduced odor-guided exploration (diet x age: F(1,1669)=16.04, p<0.001, eta squared effect size = 0.01). Memory analyses revealed robust genotype- and age-dependent impairments: at 24- and 48-hour delays, recognition indices were significantly lower in APOE4 mice compared to APOE2 (long-term memory: APOE x HN, F(2,395)=5.6, p=0.004). Elastic Net-regularized multi-set canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) linked behavior to brain network substrates, revealing subnetworks whose connectivity explained up to 24 percent of behavioral variance (sum of canonical correlations: 1.27, 95% CI [1.18, 1.85], p<0.0001). High-weighted connections between the ventral orbital cortex, somatosensory cortex, and cerebellar-brainstem pathways were identified as critical nodes for risk or compensation. Integrative blood transcriptomics revealed eigengene modules strongly correlated with imaging changes in olfactory-memory circuits (for example, eigengene 2 vs. subiculum diffusivity: r = -0.5, p < 1e-30, explaining up to 24 percent of variance). Gene ontology analysis pinpointed shared pathways in synaptic signaling, translation, and metabolic regulation across brain and blood. Notably, glutamatergic and synaptic pathways were enriched among genes linking peripheral and central compartments. Collectively, these results demonstrate that olfactory behavior, quantitatively shaped by genotype, age, diet, and immune status, serves as a sensitive and translatable early biomarker of Alzheimers disease risk. Our systems-level approach identifies specific brain networks and peripheral molecular signatures underlying sensory-cognitive vulnerability, providing a robust framework for early detection and targeted intervention in AD.

">TURBO: Automated Total-body PET Image Processing and Kinetic Modeling Toolbox</a></h4>

              
                ABSTRACT Total-body PET imaging is a novel concept that requires a high level of automatization and standardization, as the large number of target tissues increases manual workload significantly. We introduce an automated analysis pipeline (TURBO) for preprocessing and kinetic modeling of total-body [15O]H2O and [18F]FDG PET data, enabling efficient and reproducible analysis of tissue perfusion and metabolism at regional and voxel level. The approach employs automated CT segmentation for ROI delineation, image-derived input determination, and region-specific PET data kinetic modelling. Methods: We validated the analysis pipeline using Biograph Vision Quadra (Siemens Healthineers) total-body PET/CT scans from 21 subjects scanned with [15O]H2O and 16 subjects scanned with [18F]FDG using six ROIs (cortical brain gray matter, left iliopsoas, right kidney, pancreas, spleen and liver) representing different levels of blood flow and glucose metabolism. Results: Model fits showed good quality with consistent parameter estimates at both regional and voxel levels (R^2 > 0.91 for [15O]H2O, R^2 > 0.99 for [18F]FDG). Estimates from manual and automated input functions were correlated (R^2 > 0.86 for [15O]H2O, and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) with minimal bias (<10% for [15O]H2O and <2% for [18F]FDG). Manually and automatically (CT-based) extracted ROI level data showed strong agreement (R^2 > 0.82 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.83 for [18F]FDG), while motion correction had little impact on parameter estimates (R^2 > 0.83 for [15O]H2O and R^2 > 0.88 for [18F]FDG) compared with uncorrected data. Conclusion: Our automated analysis pipeline provides reliable and reproducible parameter estimates across different regions, with average processing time of <180 min per subject. This pipeline completely automatizes total-body PET analysis, reducing manual effort and enabling reproducible studies of inter-organ blood flow and metabolism, including brain-body interactions.

">Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury causes neuronal damage in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease without an enduring impact on amyloid pathology, sleep, or epileptiform activity</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. Sleep disturbances and epileptiform abnormalities can appear after TBI and may contribute to the development of neuropathology. In this study, we characterized sleep, epileptiform activity, and neuropathology after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We used the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to deliver rmTBI or sham (control) treatment to 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice (n=19). One month post-injury, we implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes, recorded for 72 hours, and then collected brain tissue and blood plasma. Our assessment of sleep architecture showed that time spent in vigilance state was not affected by the rmTBI one month post-injury; however, power spectra analysis showed a statistically significant shift towards higher frequencies in the rmTBI group during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Epileptiform activity did not differ between sham and rmTBI. Compared to sham controls, the rmTBI group showed higher neurofilament light (NF-L), but not glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in blood plasma and no change in amyloid pathology. These results indicate sustained neurological injury in the APP/PS1 mice one month after rmTBI without affecting amyloid deposition in the brain. Our study suggests that rmTBI can induce neural injury without causing enduring sleep disruption, seizures, and exacerbation of amyloidosis in the APP/PS1 mouse model.

">Integrated Profiling of Synaptic E/I Balance Reveals Altered Synaptic Organization and Phenotypic Variability in a Prenatal ASD Model</a></h4>

              
                Proper regulation of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) is essential for maintaining stable neural circuit function and flexible behavior. Disruptions of E/I balance have been implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, despite advances in connectomics and molecular neuroscience, how localized disruptions in E/I balance within cortical laminar architectures contribute to behavioral abnormalities remains to be elucidated. Here, we developed a standardized analysis pipeline that combines depth-aligned synaptic mapping, perspective and logarithmic transformations, and multivariate behavioral profiling. Applying this approach to a prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure model of ASD, we identified depth-specific disruptions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic organization within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), alongside impairments in social behavior. Principal component analysis (PCA) integrating synaptic and behavioral parameters revealed convergent abnormalities that robustly distinguished VPA-exposed mice from wild-type (WT) controls. Furthermore, although still at an exploratory stage, our findings demonstrate that the robustness of this pipeline enables both the identification of resilient individuals and the quantification of intervention effects. Together, our findings establish a new cross-level analytical framework linking synaptic organization to organismal behavior and provide insights into circuit-level mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes.

">Structural insights into wiring specificity in the neuromuscular system through the Beat-Side complex</a></h4>

              
                Nervous system assembly is guided by the actions of cell surface receptors. In Drosophila, members of the Beaten Path (Beat) and Sidestep (Side) protein families have been described as axon guidance receptor-cue pairs, in addition to roles in specifying synaptic connectivity in the optic lobe. To understand the molecular basis and specificity of Beat-Side interactions, we report here the first Beat-Side structure, Beat-Vc bound to Side-VI. The structure showed a binding topology similar to other neuronal immunoglobulin superfamily receptors, especially Nectins, SynCAMs, Dprs and DIPs, despite lack of established evolutionary relationships. Using a structure-based rational approach, we engineered and validated point mutations to break the binding between Beats and Sides. Using these mutant variants, we demonstrated in developing Drosophila larvae that the interaction between Beat-Ia and Side is required for establishing proper connectivity of motor neurons with muscles.

">Metformin boosts mitochondria and neurogenesis via AMPK/mTOR/SIRT3 in POLG mutant organoids</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mutations in the POLG gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, are the most common cause of mitochondrial diseases affecting the central nervous system. These mutations frequently result in neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying POLG related encephalopathies remain poorly understood. In particular, how POLG mutations affect mitochondrial function, neural progenitor behavior, and early neurogenesis in the developing human brain has not been fully elucidated. Methods: To investigate the impact of POLG mutations on human neurodevelopment, we generated 3D cortical brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient carrying compound heterozygous POLG mutations (A467T/W748S). Organoid development was monitored using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and live-cell mitochondrial assays. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to profile cellular diversity and transcriptional changes. Organoids were treated with metformin, a known mitochondrial modulator, and mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring membrane potential (TMRE), ATP production, and mtDNA copy number. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR signaling and markers of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy. Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests or ANOVA, with p-values < 0.05 considered significant. Results: POLG mutant cortical organoids exhibited impaired neural differentiation, with expansion of stress-associated neural progenitors and reduced neuronal populations. scRNA seq analysis revealed transcriptional signatures of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and suppressed neurogenesis, particularly in a specific neural progenitor subpopulation. Metformin treatment significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP output, and mtDNA copy number in POLG organoids. It also promoted neuronal differentiation and reduced reactive progenitor states. Mechanistically, metformin activated AMPK and SIRT3, inhibited mTOR, enhanced expression of mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis markers (OPA1, PGC-1), and increased autophagic and mitophagic activity (LC3B, BNIP3). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that POLG mutations disrupt early cortical development by impairing mitochondrial function and skewing progenitor fate. Metformin mitigates these effects by restoring mitochondrial homeostasis and promoting neurogenesis through the AMPK/SIRT3/mTOR axis. These findings offer mechanistic insights into POLG-related encephalopathy and support metformin as a candidate for therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Multivariate Resting-State Functional Connectivity Features Linked to Transdiagnostic Psychopathology in Early Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early psychosis (EP) is characterized by neurobiological changes, including alterations in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). We now understand that symptoms and neural changes may overlap across EP diagnostic categories. However, the relationship between RSFC patterns and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions remains poorly understood. Methods: We employed Partial Least Squares correlation to examine multivariate relationships between whole-brain RSFC and clinical symptoms in 124 EP patients (aged 16-35 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or a psychotic mood disorder. RSFC was computed among 216 cortical and subcortical regions. Clinical assessment included 41 symptom measures spanning positive, negative, general psychopathology, and manic dimensions. Results: Analysis revealed one significant latent component (p<0.001) capturing 41.6% of the RSFC-symptom covariance. This component was characterized by increased between-network connectivity, particularly involving sensory-motor, default mode, and subcortical regions including the amygdala and thalamus. The associated symptom profile included cognitive rigidity and arousal dysregulation (stereotyped thinking, anxiety, and somatic concerns), rather than traditional positive or negative symptoms. This brain-behavior relationship was consistent across diagnoses and independent of medication and substance use. The clinical relevance was validated through significant correlations with standardized measures of hostility (r=0.23), negative affect (r=0.25), and perceived stress (r=0.22). Conclusions: Our findings reveal a distinct transdiagnostic phenotype in EP characterized by cognitive inflexibility and arousal dysregulation that is associated with altered integration between sensory, default mode, and subcortical networks. This work suggests that specific patterns of network-level functional connectivity may relate to symptom dimensions that cut across conventional diagnostic boundaries, potentially informing more targeted therapeutic approaches.

">Childhood Maltreatment and Deviations from Normative Brain Structure: Results from 3,711 Individuals from the ENIGMA MDD and ENIGMA PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Childhood maltreatment (CM), encompassing abuse and neglect, affects over two-thirds of the general population and increases risk for stress-related psychopathology, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The extent to which neuroanatomical alterations in MDD and PTSD are attributable to CM, however, is uncertain. Here, we analyzed CM and 3D structural brain MRI data from 3,711 participants in the ENIGMA MDD and PTSD Working Groups (25 sites; 33.3+/-13.0 years; 59.9% female). Normative modeling estimated deviation z-scores for 14 subcortical volumes (SV), 68 cortical thickness (CT), and 68 surface area (SA) measures, capturing differences from population norms. Transdiagnostic associations between CM and brain deviation scores were evaluated within each sex and age cohort. In young adults (ages 18-35), abuse was associated with larger volumes in thalamus and pallidum, thinner isthmus cingulate and middle frontal regions, and thicker medial orbitofrontal cortex; there were no significant effects in pediatric ([&le;]18 years) participants. The strongest effects were observed in young female adults (|{beta}|=.07-.22, q<.05): greater abuse and neglect were correlated with smaller hippocampus and putamen volumes, thinner entorhinal cortex, and smaller SA in fusiform/inferior parietal regions, and with larger SA in orbitofrontal and occipital cortices. In males, abuse had widespread effects on CT and SA (|{beta}|=.1-.18, q<.05); effects for neglect were minimal. Our findings of age- and sex-specific instantiations of CM on brain morphometry highlight the importance of developmental context in understanding how adverse experiences shape neurobiological vulnerability to MDD and PTSD.

Multi-site extracellular recordings served to quantify local field potential-driven activity at rest and during burst STN stimulation at multiple stimulation-frequencies for 10 min. The combination of frequency-specific coherence and information flow dynamics from effective connectivity (EC) demonstrated that 160 Hz STN stimulation increases the high-γ power in RFA and CFA. Additionally, 160 Hz STN stimulation reduced the β- and high γ-frequency coherence between RFA, CFA, and STN, as well as the EC from STN towards RFA and CFA, but no change in the connectivity from cortex towards STN was attested, demonstrating hyperdirect pathway activation.

Recent findings suggest the existence of brain–behavior relationship heterogeneities during infancy; however, it remains unclear whether sex underlies these heterogeneities during this critical period when sex-related behavioral differences arise. A sample of 316 infants was included with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at neonate (3 weeks), 1 year and 2 years of age. We used multiple linear regression to test interactions between sex and resting-state functional connectivity on behavioral scores of working memory, inhibitory self-control, intelligence, and anxiety collected at 4 years of age. We found 6 age-specific, intra-hemispheric connections showing significant and robust sex differences in functional connectivity–behavior relationships. All connections are either with the prefrontal cortex or in regions with direct anatomical pathways to the prefrontal cortex. These sex differences in functional connectivity only emerge when associated with behavior and not in functional connectivity independently. Taken together, we capture robust and conserved brain mechanisms that are distinct to sex and are defined by their relationship to behavioral outcomes.

                Shimizu et al. identified a unique subset of CD9hiCD63hiCD206+Class IIlo hypoxic TAMs in the vicinity of tumor cells that “cross-dress” major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC)/tumor antigen epitopes through trogocytosis. This TAM trogocytosis is regulated by Ch25h expression, and their elimination can enhance antitumor effects of immunotherapy.

                <p>Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual tasks and whether neural correlates before or after the primary decision contribute to self-reported confidence. This focus has been useful, yet the reliance on subjective confidence reports may confound our understanding of key everyday features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions must be rapidly evaluated without explicit feedback and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations led us to hypothesize that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (<I>N</I> = 21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual task generalized to distinguish correct and error trials in the subsequent nonspeeded auditory discrimination. This generalization did not occur for classifiers trained on the visual stimulus-locked data and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping post-response neural activity provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>Rod and cone photoreceptor cells selectively contact different compartments of axon-bearing retinal horizontal cells in the mammalian retina. Cones synapse exclusively on the soma whereas rods synapse exclusively on a large axon terminal compartment. The possibility that rod signals can travel down the axon from terminal to soma has been proposed as a means of producing spectrally opponent interactions between rods and cones, but there is conflicting data about whether this actually occurs. The spectral overlap between rods and cones in mouse makes it difficult to stimulate rod and cone pigments separately. We therefore used optogenetic techniques to analyze photoreceptor inputs into horizontal somas by selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in rods and/or cones. Optogenetic stimulation of rods and cones both evoked large fast inward currents in horizontal cell somas. Cone-driven responses were abolished by eliminating synaptic release in a cone-specific knock-out of the exocytotic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, rod-driven responses in horizontal somas were unchanged after eliminating synaptic release from rods but abolished by eliminating release from both rods and cones. This suggests that release from cones is required for transmission of rod signals to horizontal cell somas. Rods and cones are coupled by Cx36 gap junctions, and we found that selective elimination of Cx36 from rods also abolished rod-driven optogenetic responses in horizontal cell somas. Together, these results show that rod signals reach the somas of B-type horizontal cells exclusively via gap junctions with cones and not by transmission down the axon from the axon terminal.</p>

                <p>Perceptual localization of brief, high-contrast perisaccadic visual probes is grossly erroneous. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory&ndash;motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, noncardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a saccade toward an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally imposed delay, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade toward the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization toward the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is the strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.</p>

                <p>by Wiep Stikvoort, Eider Pérez-Ordoyo, Iván Mindlin, Anira Escrichs, Jacobo D. Sitt, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Yonatan Sanz Perl</p>

Assessing someone’s level of consciousness is a complex matter, and attempts have been made to aid clinicians in these assessments through metrics based on neuroimaging data. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in altered states of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after <i>in silico</i> perturbations, using a simulated fMRI-based version of the Perturbational Complexity Index, a measure that has been shown to distinguish different levels of consciousness in <i>in vivo</i> settings. Crucially, we found that states of consciousness involving lower arousal and/or lower awareness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities, a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity compared to control subjects. We show that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

                <p>by Kevin J. Flynn, Andrew Yu. Morozov</p>

Many organisms, notably phototrophs, routinely acquire resources over only a fraction of the day. They have to balance their main period of initial biosynthesis against cell cycle events. Because of their short generation times, this challenge is especially acute for the planktonic microalgae that perform 50% of global C-fixation. Empirical evidence indicates that microalgal day-average growth is a function of the ability to acquire resources rapidly when available, retaining initial products of assimilation to support growth. A fundamental question arises over the optimal physiological configuration to support such activity. Here, we applied computer simulations implementing a development of the quota concept, in which the internal limiting resource is itself C, ratioed against total organism C-biomass. The model comprises metabolite and core pools of carbon C (<sup>M</sup><i>C</i> and <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>, respectively), with growth modulated by <sup>M</sup><i>C</i>/(<sup>M</sup><i>C</i><sup> </sup>+ <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>); <sup>M</sup><i>C</i> supports growth of <sup>C</sup><i>C</i> in the absence of concurrent resource acquisition. Dynamic feedback interactions from the relative size of <sup>M</sup>C controls resource acquisition. The model reproduces the general pattern of growth at different light:day fraction (<i>LD</i>), and of afternoon-depression of C-fixation. We explored the efficiency of the physiological cell configuration to locate optimal configurations at different combinations of maximum growth rates (<i>U</i><sub>max</sub>) and <i>LD</i> values across plausible parameter values for microalgae. While the optimum maximum resource acquisition rate deployed during the L phase scales with <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>LD</i>, the maximum size of the metabolite pool scales to <i>LD</i>/<i>DV</i>, where <i>DV</i> is division time (i.e. <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/Ln(2)). Accordingly, we conclude that faster growing organisms carry a penalty limiting their geographic spread to latitudes and seasons where <i>LD</i> is high. Larger, vacuolated organisms (such as diatoms), having a bigger metabolite compartment, may be at an advantage in such situations.

                <p>by Swathi Anil, Dan F. M. Goodman, Marcus Ghosh</p>

Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of pediatric “mild” traumatic brain injury (pmTBI), very little is known about the long-term effects of injury on brain structure and how injuries manifest in the context of dynamic and regionally specific neurodevelopmental changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospective study design characterizing long-term effects of pmTBI on both global (brain age) and regional (hippocampal volume, hippocampal subfields, and cortical thickness) brain structure at approximately 7 days, 4 months, and 1-year post-injury. A large sample of age- and sex-matched healthy controls was imaged at identical temporal intervals to account for typical neurodevelopmental changes, and to assess how trauma potentially affects developmental trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 269 pmTBI (age = 14.4 ± 2.9; 41.6% female) and 232 healthy controls (age = 14.1 ± 2.9; 44.8% female) were included in the final analyses (&gt;70% 1-year retention). Results demonstrated that the presence of loss of consciousness and/or post-traumatic amnesia was associated with increased brain age up to 1-year post-injury, increased frontal cortical thickness at 4 months, as well as hippocampal atrophy across all time points relative to controls. “Mild” head trauma also interfered with hippocampal neurodevelopment in a dose-dependent fashion, including within the CA1 subfield. In contrast, post-concussive symptom burden was not associated with any structural abnormalities or alterations to neurodevelopment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Current findings suggest a dose-dependent relationship between injury severity and alterations in both global and regional brain structure within the spectrum of pmTBI. Our results emphasize the importance of using objective biomarkers rather than subjective self-reported symptoms to better understand the long-term effects of injury.

<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy filters and 2-fuzzy filters of a quasi-ordered residuated system K . This research explores comparative, normal, implicative and associative fuzzy filters within a quasi-ordered residuated system. It establishes the sufficient conditions under which a comparative fuzzy filter in K qualifies as a normal fuzzy filter and vice-versa. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the collection of all comparative fuzzy filters in K constitutes a complete lattice. The notion of fuzzy filters of a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated system is introduced and the analysis extends to fantastic, comparative, associative and implicative fuzzy filters within a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated framework. Finally, it is proven that an associative fuzzy filter in K inherently satisfies the criteria for both implicative and comparative fuzzy filters.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1.3% to 4% of paediatric appendectomies. It is the most common complication after an appendectomy. Surgical complications in paediatric patients increase patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections, falls and drug-related side effects The aim of this study was to identify the modifiable risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Methodology Paediatric patients who underwent appendectomies from April 2018 to April 2023 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in coastal Karnataka were included. Clinical characteristics of patients were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results A total of 459 paediatric patients underwent appendectomies between 2018 and 2023. 45 (9.8%) developed surgical site infections (SSIs). Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate) revealed significant associations (p < 0.05) between SSIs and the following categorical variables: faecal incontinence, surgical technique, wound type, type of appendicitis, postoperative stay and use of invasive devices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further identified laparotomy (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.31–14.74), presence of invasive devices (OR = 104.4, 95% CI: 5.45–2002.93), longer consultation-to-surgery time (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17–1.88), and increased surgery duration (OR = 1.02 per minute, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04) as independent risk factors significantly associated with the development of SSIs. Discussion The study identified laparotomy, use of drains, delayed surgery, and longer operation time as key risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Despite standard precautions, high SSI rates were observed, likely due to modifiable surgical factors and antimicrobial resistance. The findings highlight the need for optimized surgical practices, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary strategies to reduce SSI rates and improve patient outcomes.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897.

                Introduction phlebitis is one of the complications associated with the placement of peripheral intravascular lines in neonates and serves as an indicator of the quality of care provided by health professionals. Determining its incidence and predictors provides valuable evidence for stakeholders to address this issue and the potential factors contributing to phlebitis. Objective This study aims to determine the incidence and predictors of phlebitis among neonates with perinatal asphyxia admitted at the neonatal intensive care unit of West Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Method A multicentered, institution-based prospective follow-up study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2024, at the Northwest Amhara Region Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was employed, and data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry of neonates. The collected data were entered into EPI-DATA V.4.6.0.0 and analyzed using STATA V.14. The Kaplan-Meier failure curve and log-rank test were utilized, and both bivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of phlebitis. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Result The overall incidence of phlebitis was 20.9 per 1,000 neonate-day observations (95% CI: 17.12-25.54) during the entire follow-up period. Of the 423 neonates admitted to the NICU, 96 (22.69%) (95% CI: 18.93-26.94) developed phlebitis. Significant predictors included birth asphyxia (AHR= 2.1; 95% CI: 1.38-3.19), trials of cannulation (AHR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.01-6.36), macrosomic neonates (AHR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.17-7.96), flushed cannulas (AHR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.97), and short dwelling time (AHR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.765). Conculsion The incidence rate of phlebitis was higher than that reported in other studies. Predictors of phlebitis included birth asphyxia, the number of cannulation trials, macrosomic neonates, flushed cannulas, and shorter dwelling times.

                Introduction Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a serious concern for preterm infants and can predispose such infants to brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim The present study aimed to determine the frequency of IVH and its risk factors in the premature newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at King Fahd University Hospital. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 201 preterm neonates admitted at King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Saudi Arabia over a period of 7 years (from 2016 to 2023). These neonates were diagnosed by cranial ultrasound. IVH was classified into four grades based on Papile classification. The frequency of IVH was compared across various attributing factors i.e., gestational age at delivery, gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal antenatal steroids. Results Two hundred and one patients were analyzed (male 50.7% vs. female 49.3%). 51.2% had a gestational age of 29 weeks or less. More than half (54.2%) had a birth weight of ≤1200g. The incidence of IVH in a 7-year duration was 41.8%, with stage 1 (41.7%) and stage 2 (34.5%) being the most common IVH stages. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CHD, seizure, and ROP were identified as the significant independent predictors of IVH among preterm infants. Conclusion IVH in premature infants remains a complex and delicate issue in neonatology. An integrated approach covering both prevention and treatment is essential to minimize the negative impact of this complication on the neurological development of premature infants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v1?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Income gaps threaten democratic vitality, yet the evidence is mixed on whether economic inequality inevitably suppresses citizens’ political voices. We argue that institutional integrity—particularly the capacity to curb corruption—conditions how inequality translates into civic disengagement. By embedding governance quality in the inequality-participation debate, this study addresses a significant omission in comparative political-economy scholarship and offers policy-relevant insights. Methods We compile a balanced panel of ten democracies—Australia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—for 2002-2022. Voice and Accountability (Worldwide Governance Indicators) are the outcome variable; predictors include the lagged Gini Index, extreme poverty headcount, GDP-per-capita growth, and five governance metrics. Country- and year-fixed-effects regressions with cluster-robust errors are estimated. Diagnostic tests (Pesaran LM, IPS, Westerlund, VIF) guide specification and interaction terms to assess whether strong corruption control moderates inequality’s impact in developed versus developing subsamples. Results Corruption control is the strongest positive predictor of democratic voice, while inequality and poverty are insignificant in isolation. Interaction models reveal pronounced asymmetries. In developed economies, the deleterious effect of inequality is neutralised—and sometimes reversed—when corruption is tightly controlled (β = +0.028, p < 0.01). In developing economies, inequality remains benign until corruption escalates, at which point higher Gini scores significantly erode Voice and Accountability (β = -0.020, p ≈ 0.07). Corrected models confirm a modest universal adverse effect of inequality once institutional dynamics are constant. Conclusions Inequality is not destiny; its democratic toll depends on whether institutions can control corruption. Policy agendas that redistribute income will underperform if they neglect governance reforms. Combating graft, professionalising public administration, and expanding digital feedback channels can shield civic participation even in unequal societies. Conversely, failing to fortify institutions leaves democracies—especially developing ones—vulnerable to a corrosive feedback loop of widening gaps and falling political voices.

<br/>
<p>The advances achieved against multiple sclerosis (MS) represent one of the great success stories of modern molecular medicine. The development of therapies with increasing selectivity and safety, guided by gains in understanding the fundamental immunology, neurobiology, genetics, and triggers of this disease, have broadened the traditional focus on treatment, adding realistic possibilities for prevention and repair. Here, we summarize recent advances that have together transformed the disease from the most common crippler of young adults in the western world to its place today as a condition in which most newly diagnosed patients can anticipate lives free from disability.
