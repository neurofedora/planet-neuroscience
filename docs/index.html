	<p>This study introduces Multi-Threshold Recurrence Rate Plots (MTRRP), a novel methodology for analyzing dynamic patterns in complex systems, such as those influenced by neurodegenerative diseases in brain activity. MTRRP characterizes how recurrence rates evolve with increasing recurrence thresholds. A key innovation of our approach, Recurrence Complexity, captures structural complexity by integrating local randomness and global structural features through the product of Recurrence Rate Gradient and Recurrence Hurst, both derived from MTRRP. We applied this technique to resting-state EEG data from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and age-matched healthy controls. The results revealed significantly higher recurrence complexity in the occipital areas of AD and FTD patients, particularly pronounced in the Alpha and Beta frequency bands. Furthermore, EEG features derived from MTRRP were evaluated using a Support Vector Machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.7%. These findings not only underscore the utility of MTRRP in detecting distinct neurophysiological patterns associated with neurodegenerative diseases but also highlight its broader applicability in time series analysis, providing a substantial tool for advancing medical diagnostics and research.</p>

                In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1076/v2?src=rss">Effect of blood flow restriction training on pressure pain threshold and hand function among adults with persistent neck pain: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Persistent neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that affects the quality of life and functional abilities of individuals. Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFRT) is a novel therapeutic approach that involves restricting blood flow to exercising muscles to enhance strength and function. However, limited research has been conducted on the effects of BFRT on pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the potential benefits of BFRT as a treatment intervention for this population. Methods This study will be a prospective 1:1 allocation, parallel group active controlled trail conducted at Physiotherapy Department, Galgotias University. The trial was prospectively registered with the Clinical Trial Registry India CTRI/2023/06/053439. Informed consent will be obtained from all the participants who are eligible to be included in the study. A total of 110 patients with persistent neck pain will be randomly allocated into two groups. The BFRT group will receive supervised training sessions three times a week for eight weeks, performing low-load resistance exercises with blood flow restriction applied using personalized cuff pressure. The control group will receive standard care for neck pain, which may include general advice, manual therapy, and/or home exercises without BFRT. The primary outcome measures will be the pressure pain threshold, assessed using a pressure Algometer, and hand function, evaluated using standardized tests such as Hand Grip Strength and Purdue Peg board Test. Results The data obtained will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Conclusion This trial will contribute valuable contribution highlighting the potential benefits of BFR training in improving pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain.

                Background In recent years, various advancements in anticancer therapy have led to the development of multiple regimens and protocols. This study endeavors to provide an extensive evaluation of anticancer therapy prescription patterns in correlation with patient outcomes. Methods From June 2014 to April 2022, we included adult cancer patients who received anticancer therapy in our cancer center. Collected data encompassed demographic characteristics of patients and cancer, chemotherapy protocols or agents, antiemetics, drug side effects, and the patient’s last status. The prescribed drugs were assessed using the Essential Medicines List, while the prescription’s rationality was determined using the World Health Organization indicators. Results The mean age was 55.16 ± 17.04 years, with 56.4% of the patients being males. Gastrointestinal (29.7%) and breast (25.8%) cancers were the most common malignancies. The main protocols included a combination of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (20.1%) and folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOX) regimen (13.5%). The most frequently used drugs were doxorubicin (14.0%), cyclophosphamide (13.3%), and docetaxel (9.9%). The majority of patients also did not report any acute adverse events related to chemotherapy (81.1%). Antiemetics, mainly metoclopramide-based, were used in 76.07% of cases. Remarkably, 86.7% of anticancer agents were from the EML, and 90.1% were prescribed generically. Conclusion In this study, gastrointestinal cancers were the most prevalent cancers observed, with more preponderance among males. Most anticancer agents were taken from the essential drug list, with the majority being prescribed under generic names, indicating rational use.

                Background Pulmonary involvement is a major cause of internal organ complication and the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study aimed to demonstrate the characteristics of pulmonary function (PF) in Thai patients with SSc and the association between PF and body mass index (BMI) and anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl70). Methods All patients diagnosed with SSc in our tertiary care teaching hospital database between 2016 and 2021 were reviewed and analyzed. Results Of 211 SSc patients, 128 patients who underwent the PF test were enrolled; 102 (79.7%) were female. The mean age was 54 years. The median BMI for all patients was 21.7 kg/m2. Regarding anti-Scl70, 10.9% of patients were positive, 7.8% were negative, and the status was unreported for 81.3%. The mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.8 (0.1). The mean (SD) % predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were 76.3 (16.3), 69.1 (15.8), and 75.5 (22.8), respectively. A restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP) was found in 78.8% of the patients. DLCO had a moderate positive linear correlation with FVC (r=0.50, p <0.001) and a moderate negative linear correlation with BMI (r=-0.36, p <0.001). However, there was no correlation between FVC and BMI. There was no statistical difference in demographic data or the presence of anti-Scl70 among patients with or without RSP. Conclusions RSP is common among Thai patients with SSc. However, the power of using demographic data and the presence of anti-Scl70 to determine the probability of pulmonary involvement remains limited.

                Introduction The commonest type of cancer in the head and neck region is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) due to its high rates of occurrence and mortality. The early diagnosis of oral cancer gives better prognosis. Brandwein-Gensler criteria predict the early stage of OSCC cases with a high risk of locoregional recurrence. Objectives To correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion of OSCC with three-year survival. Methodology In the study, This study will include 80 random histopathologically-diagnosed cases of OSCC. hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained section slides will be used to evaluate, Brandwein and Gensler criteria by three histopathologists in a blinded manner. The depth of invasion assessment will be done from the basement-membrane (BM), in regions where the BM has been lost, as well as from an illustrative line connecting the BM from the neighbouring epithelium to the point of deepest tumour invasion in the connective-tissue stroma with the help of a research microscope (Leica-DMLB2) in resected tissue specimens of OSCC cases. Expected results The present study will find the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion in OSCC in order to evaluate the locoregional recurrence in OSCC cases. In high-risk OSCC cases, there may be an increased depth of invasion in resected tissues. Conclusions We hypothesized that the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion can be used as an independent predictor for locoregional recurrence in OSCC.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-968/v3?src=rss">The realization of interpersonal meanings in cosmetic Maybelline New York in 2018 advertisements [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Interpersonal meaning is the interaction between the speaker and the listener and the writer and the reader. This study aims to determine the structure of mood and how the structure of mood is found. The purposes of this study are (1) to be more sensitive to the mood structure shown in Maybelline New York cosmetic advertisement. (2) to investigate the reason of why interrogative sentences are more difficult to find than declarative sentences. Through this research, we can see the types of mood structures, and how these mood structures are used. Methods The type of research approach used is descriptive qualitative. Research in this case describes systematically, factually and accurately facts and causal relationships of the phenomena studied. The sources of data in this study are eight cosmetic Maybelline New York products, namely the Maybelline gel pencil, L’oreal colour riche nail, Maybelline mascara and eyeliner, Maybelline creamy lipmatte and Maybelline eyeshadow, Maybelline eyeliner, Maybelline lipstick, and Maybelline clear smooth all in one. Results In analyzing the data, the researcher of the 2014 Halliday theory revised by Mathiesse found that there are three types of manifested mood, four types of realized speech function, and mood-based realization of speech function. The moods manifested were declarative (48.64%), interrogative (5.40%) and imperative (45.94%). Speech functions that are realized are statements (48.64%), questions (5.40%), offers (18.91%) and command (24.32%). Conclusions It can be concluded that declarative sentences are mostly found in Maybelline New York products. Researchers suggest that readers be more careful in using mood structures in cosmetic advertisements so that there are no misunderstandings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1339/v3?src=rss">Outward investment of Portuguese small and medium enterprises in the Central and Eastern European countries: motivations and challenges [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion. The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-559/v1?src=rss">Distress and Rewards of Nurses with Experience in COVID-19 Wards: A Qualitative Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Amidst the global escalation of COVID-19, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to some moral dilemmas. This study aims to explore the psychological burden and dilemmas faced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards, elucidating their professional distress and rewards, and examining their interrelation. Methods This qualitative descriptive study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data on the experiences of nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results The study involved 12 participants (8 women and 4 men). Their experience ranged from 4-21 years. The group included 6 staff nurses, 3 head or deputy head nurses, and 3 head nurses. No significant changes were observed in weekly working hours pre- and post-COVID-19. Analysis of the interviews revealed that nurses working in COVID-19 wards experienced conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they also reported finding rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions This study revealed that nurses experienced distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges, leading to a sense of mistrust towards their organizations. However, working in COVID-19 wards also brought a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly through interactions with individuals they had not previously encountered. These experiences are illustrative of the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the distress and rewards inherent in their roles.

                Background Differentiating between ameloblastoma (AB) and ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is difficult, especially when AB has atypical cytological characteristics or an uncommon clinical history. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the differential expression of immunohistochemical markers between AB and AC. Methods We conducted a thorough search of PUBMED and SCOPUS according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify cross-sectional studies that compared the expression of immunohistochemical markers in AB and AC. We used a random-effects model to analyze the risk ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The Egger’s test was used to assess publication bias. Results In total, 301 articles were identified. After excluding irrelevant titles and abstracts, 86 articles were selected for full-text review. We categorized the 41 markers into proliferative and non-proliferative markers. Among non-proliferative markers, nuclear markers were differentially expressed in AB and AC. SOX2 was the only marker that significantly differentiated AB and AC, with an RR of -0.19 (CI 0.10-0.36, I2=0). Conclusion The current evidence suggests the significance of SOX2 in differentiating between AB and AC, warranting prospective confirmation in well-defined extensive studies. We highlight the paucity of high-quality replicated studies of other markers in this field. Collaborative efforts with standardized techniques are necessary to generate clinically useful immunohistochemical markers.

                Background Determining the appropriate computational requirements and software performance is essential for efficient genomic surveillance. The lack of standardized benchmarking complicates software selection, especially with limited resources. Methods We developed a containerized benchmarking pipeline to evaluate seven long-read assemblers—Canu, GoldRush, MetaFlye, Strainline, HaploDMF, iGDA, and RVHaplo—for viral haplotype reconstruction, using both simulated and experimental Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of HIV-1 and other viruses. Benchmarking was conducted on three computational systems to assess each assembler’s performance, utilizing QUAST and BLASTN for quality assessment. Results Our findings show that assembler choice significantly impacts assembly time, with CPU and memory usage having minimal effect. Assembler selection also influences the size of the contigs, with a minimum read length of 2,000 nucleotides required for quality assembly. A 4,000-nucleotide read length improves quality further. Canu was efficient among de novo assemblers but not suitable for multi-strain mixtures, while GoldRush produced only consensus assemblies. Strainline and MetaFlye were suitable for metagenomic sequencing data, with Strainline requiring high memory and MetaFlye operable on low-specification machines. Among reference-based assemblers, iGDA had high error rates, RVHaplo showed the best runtime and accuracy but became ineffective with similar sequences, and HaploDMF, utilizing machine learning, had fewer errors with a slightly longer runtime. Conclusions The HIV-64148 pipeline, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and offers flexibility to select from a range of assemblers to match computational systems or study requirements. This tool aids in genome assembly and provides valuable information on HIV-1 sequences, enhancing viral evolution monitoring and understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012186">Astrocytes as a mechanism for contextually-guided network dynamics and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lulu Gong, Fabio Pasqualetti, Thomas Papouin, ShiNung Ching</p>

Astrocytes are a ubiquitous and enigmatic type of non-neuronal cell and are found in the brain of all vertebrates. While traditionally viewed as being supportive of neurons, it is increasingly recognized that astrocytes play a more direct and active role in brain function and neural computation. On account of their sensitivity to a host of physiological covariates and ability to modulate neuronal activity and connectivity on slower time scales, astrocytes may be particularly well poised to modulate the dynamics of neural circuits in functionally salient ways. In the current paper, we seek to capture these features via actionable abstractions within computational models of neuron-astrocyte interaction. Specifically, we engage how nested feedback loops of neuron-astrocyte interaction, acting over separated time-scales, may endow astrocytes with the capability to enable learning in context-dependent settings, where fluctuations in task parameters may occur much more slowly than within-task requirements. We pose a general model of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interaction and use formal analysis to characterize how astrocytic modulation may constitute a form of meta-plasticity, altering the ways in which synapses and neurons adapt as a function of time. We then embed this model in a bandit-based reinforcement learning task environment, and show how the presence of time-scale separated astrocytic modulation enables learning over multiple fluctuating contexts. Indeed, these networks learn far more reliably compared to dynamically homogeneous networks and conventional non-network-based bandit algorithms. Our results fuel the notion that neuron-astrocyte interactions in the brain benefit learning over different time-scales and the conveyance of task-relevant contextual information onto circuit dynamics.

                <p>by Garrick W. Bruening, Robert J. Courter, Shruthi Sukumar, Megan K. O’Brien, Alaa A. Ahmed</p>

On any given day, we make countless reaching movements to objects around us. While such ubiquity may suggest uniformity, each movement’s speed is unique—why is this? Reach speed is known to be influenced by accuracy; we slow down to sustain high accuracy. However, in other forms of movement like walking or running, metabolic cost is often the primary determinant of movement speed. Here we bridge this gap and ask: how do metabolic cost and accuracy interact to determine speed of reaching movements? First, we systematically measure the effect of increasing mass on the metabolic cost of reaching across a range of movement speeds. Next, in a sequence of three experiments, we examine how added mass affects preferred reaching speed across changing accuracy requirements. We find that, while added mass consistently increases metabolic cost thereby leading to slower metabolically optimal movement speeds, self-selected reach speeds are slower than those predicted by an optimization of metabolic cost alone. We then demonstrate how a single model that considers both accuracy and metabolic costs can explain preferred movement speeds. Together, our findings provide a unifying framework to illuminate the combined effects of metabolic cost and accuracy on movement speed and highlight the integral role metabolic cost plays in determining reach speed.

                <p>by Thomas J. Hladish, Alexander N. Pillai, Carl A. B. Pearson, Kok Ben Toh, Andrea C. Tamayo, Arlin Stoltzfus, Ira M. Longini</p>

We evaluate approaches to vaccine distribution using an agent-based model of human activity and COVID-19 transmission calibrated to detailed trends in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, seroprevalence, and vaccine breakthrough infections in Florida, USA. We compare the incremental effectiveness for four different distribution strategies at four different levels of vaccine supply, starting in late 2020 through early 2022. Our analysis indicates that the best strategy to reduce severe outcomes would be to actively target high disease-risk individuals. This was true in every scenario, although the advantage was greatest for the intermediate vaccine availability assumptions and relatively modest compared to a simple mass vaccination approach under high vaccine availability. Ring vaccination, while generally the most effective strategy for reducing infections, ultimately proved least effective at preventing deaths. We also consider using age group as a practical surrogate measure for actual disease-risk targeting; this approach also outperforms both simple mass distribution and ring vaccination. We find that quantitative effectiveness of a strategy depends on whether effectiveness is assessed after the alpha, delta, or omicron wave. However, these differences in absolute benefit for the strategies do not change the ranking of their performance at preventing severe outcomes across vaccine availability assumptions.

                <p>by Philippe Nguyen, Jinani Sooriyaarachchi, Qianyu Huang, Curtis L. Baker Jr.</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond selectively to simple features of visual stimuli, such as orientation and spatial frequency. Simple cells, which have phase-sensitive responses, can be modeled by a single receptive field filter in a linear-nonlinear model. However, it is challenging to analyze phase-invariant complex cells, which require more elaborate models having a combination of nonlinear subunits. Estimating parameters of these models is made additionally more difficult by cortical neurons’ trial-to-trial response variability. We develop a simple convolutional neural network method to estimate receptive field models for both simple and complex visual cortex cells from their responses to natural images. The model consists of a spatiotemporal filter, a parameterized rectifier unit (PReLU), and a two-dimensional Gaussian "map" of the receptive field envelope. A single model parameter determines the simple vs. complex nature of the receptive field, capturing complex cell responses as a summation of homogeneous subunits, and collapsing to a linear-nonlinear model for simple type cells. The convolutional method predicts simple and complex cell responses to natural image stimuli as well as grating tuning curves. The fitted models yield a continuum of values for the PReLU parameter across the sampled neurons, showing that the simple/complex nature of cells can vary in a continuous manner. We demonstrate that complex-like cells respond less reliably than simple-like cells. However, compensation for this unreliability with noise ceiling analysis reveals predictive performance for complex cells proportionately closer to that for simple cells. Most spatial receptive field structures are well fit by Gabor functions, whose parameters confirm well-known properties of cat A17/18 receptive fields.

                <p>by Tomas Ferreira Amaro Freire, Zhijian Hu, Kevin B. Wood, Erida Gjini</p>

Multi-drug combinations to treat bacterial populations are at the forefront of approaches for infection control and prevention of antibiotic resistance. Although the evolution of antibiotic resistance has been theoretically studied with mathematical population dynamics models, extensions to spatial dynamics remain rare in the literature, including in particular spatial evolution of multi-drug resistance. In this study, we propose a reaction-diffusion system that describes the multi-drug evolution of bacteria based on a drug-concentration rescaling approach. We show how the resistance to drugs in space, and the consequent adaptation of growth rate, is governed by a Price equation with diffusion, integrating features of drug interactions and collateral resistances or sensitivities to the drugs. We study spatial versions of the model where the distribution of drugs is homogeneous across space, and where the drugs vary environmentally in a piecewise-constant, linear and nonlinear manner. Although in many evolution models, per capita growth rate is a natural surrogate for fitness, in spatially-extended, potentially heterogeneous habitats, fitness is an emergent property that potentially reflects additional complexities, from boundary conditions to the specific spatial variation of growth rates. Applying concepts from perturbation theory and reaction-diffusion equations, we propose an analytical metric for characterization of <i>average mutant fitness</i> in the spatial system based on the principal eigenvalue of our linear problem, λ<sub>1</sub>. This enables an accurate translation from drug spatial gradients and mutant antibiotic susceptibility traits to the relative advantage of each mutant across the environment. Our approach allows one to predict the precise outcomes of selection among mutants over space, ultimately from comparing their λ<sub>1</sub> values, which encode a critical interplay between growth functions, movement traits, habitat size and boundary conditions. Such mathematical understanding opens new avenues for multi-drug therapeutic optimization.

                <p>by Yifei Ren, Pouya Bashivan</p>

Unit activity in particular deep neural networks (DNNs) are remarkably similar to the neuronal population responses to static images along the primate ventral visual cortex. Linear combinations of DNN unit activities are widely used to build predictive models of neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Nevertheless, prediction performance in these models is often investigated on stimulus sets consisting of everyday objects under naturalistic settings. Recent work has revealed a generalization gap in how predicting neuronal responses to synthetically generated out-of-distribution (OOD) stimuli. Here, we investigated how the recent progress in improving DNNs’ object recognition generalization, as well as various DNN design choices such as architecture, learning algorithm, and datasets have impacted the generalization gap in neural predictivity. We came to a surprising conclusion that the performance on none of the common computer vision OOD object recognition benchmarks is predictive of OOD neural predictivity performance. Furthermore, we found that adversarially robust models often yield substantially higher generalization in neural predictivity, although the degree of robustness itself was not predictive of neural predictivity score. These results suggest that improving object recognition behavior on current benchmarks alone may not lead to more general models of neurons in the primate ventral visual cortex.

Negation is key for cognition but has no physical basis, raising questions about its neural origins. A new study in PLOS Biology on the negation of scalar adjectives shows that negation acts in part by altering the response to the adjective it negates.

All languages make use of negation, but the neural bases of our cognitive ability to process negation remain unknown. This Primer explores a new PLOS Biology study which shows that humans first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning.

Vesicular trafficking, including secretion and endocytosis, plays fundamental roles in the unique biology of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage parasites. Endocytosis of host cell cytosol (HCC) provides nutrients and room for parasite growth and is critical for the action of antimalarial drugs and parasite drug resistance. Previous work showed that PfVPS45 functions in endosomal transport of HCC to the parasite’s food vacuole, raising the possibility that malaria parasites possess a canonical endolysosomal system. However, the seeming absence of VPS45-typical functional interactors such as rabenosyn 5 (Rbsn5) and the repurposing of Rab5 isoforms and other endolysosomal proteins for secretion in apicomplexans question this idea. Here, we identified a parasite Rbsn5-like protein and show that it functions with VPS45 in the endosomal transport of HCC. We also show that PfRab5b but not PfRab5a is involved in the same process. Inactivation of PfRbsn5L resulted in PI3P and PfRab5b decorated HCC-filled vesicles, typical for endosomal compartments. Overall, this indicates that despite the low sequence conservation of PfRbsn5L and the unusual N-terminal modification of PfRab5b, principles of endosomal transport in malaria parasite are similar to that of model organisms. Using a conditional double protein inactivation system, we further provide evidence that the PfKelch13 compartment, an unusual apicomplexa-specific endocytosis structure at the parasite plasma membrane, is connected upstream of the Rbsn5L/VPS45/Rab5b-dependent endosomal route. Altogether, this work indicates that HCC uptake consists of a highly parasite-specific part that feeds endocytosed material into an endosomal system containing more canonical elements, leading to the delivery of HCC to the food vacuole.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

                Disentangling how cognitive functions emerge from the interplay of brain dynamics and network architecture is among the major challenges that neuroscientists face. Pharmacological and pathological perturbations of consciousness provide a lens to investigate these complex challenges. Here, we review how recent advances about consciousness and the brain’s functional organisation have been driven by a common denominator: decomposing brain function into fundamental constituents of time, space, and information. Whereas unconsciousness increases structure–function coupling across scales, psychedelics may decouple brain function from structure. Convergent effects also emerge: anaesthetics, psychedelics, and disorders of consciousness can exhibit similar reconfigurations of the brain’s unimodal–transmodal functional axis. Decomposition approaches reveal the potential to translate discoveries across species, with computational modelling providing a path towards mechanistic integration.

                The adhesive interaction between endothelial cells (ECs) and the matrix generates restrictive endothelium but the mechanism remains unclear. Akhter et al. show that, in a kinase-independent manner, FAK suppression of the RhoA pathway safeguards tension transmission to the nucleus, limiting emerin-DNMT3a activities and enabling KLF2 transcription of the restricted ECs for vascular homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93087">Aberrant methylation and expression of TNXB promote chondrocyte apoptosis and extracullar matrix degradation in hemophilic arthropathy via AKT signaling</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent joint bleeding in hemophilia patients frequently causes hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. In HA cartilages, we found server matrix degradation and increased expression of DNA methyltransferase proteins. We thus performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on human HA (N=5) and osteoarthritis (OA) (N=5) articular cartilages, and identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the association between DMR genes (DMGs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Among these DMGs, Tenascin XB (TNXB) expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. The loss of <i>Tnxb</i> in <i>F8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse cartilage provided a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed chondroprotective effects following <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown. Together, our findings indicate that exposure of cartilage to blood leads to alterations in DNA methylation, which is functionally related to ECM homeostasis, and further demonstrate a critical role of TNXB in HA cartilage degeneration by activating AKT signaling. These mechanistic insights allow development of potentially new strategies for HA cartilage protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89516">Genetically defined nucleus incertus neurons differ in connectivity and function</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus incertus (NI), a conserved hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of <i>goosecoid homeobox 2</i> (<i>gsc2</i>) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to <i>relaxin 3a</i> (<i>rln3a</i>) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate the characteristics of the <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression specifically in each neuronal group, and found that they differ in their efferent and afferent connectivity, spontaneous activity, and functional properties. <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons have widely divergent projection patterns and innervate distinct subregions of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Whereas <i>gsc2</i> neurons are activated more robustly by electric shock, <i>rln3a</i> neurons exhibit spontaneous fluctuations in calcium signaling and regulate locomotor activity. Our findings define heterogeneous neurons in the NI and provide new tools to probe its diverse functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91798">SMAD4 promotes somatic-germline contact during murine oocyte growth</a></h4>

              
                Development of the mammalian oocyte requires physical contact with the surrounding granulosa cells of the follicle, which provide it with essential nutrients and regulatory signals. This contact is achieved through specialized filopodia, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that extend from the granulosa cells to the oocyte surface. Transforming growth factor (TGFβ) family ligands produced by the oocyte increase the number of TZPs, but how they do so is unknown. Using an inducible Cre recombinase strategy together with expression of green fluorescent protein to verify Cre activity in individual cells, we examined the effect of depleting the canonical TGFβ mediator, SMAD4, in mouse granulosa cells. We observed a 20–50% decrease in the total number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cell-oocyte complexes, and a 50% decrease in the number of newly generated TZPs when the granulosa cells were reaggregated with wild-type oocytes. Three-dimensional image analysis revealed that TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were longer than controls and more frequently oriented towards the oocyte. Strikingly, the transmembrane proteins, N-cadherin and Notch2, were reduced by 50% in SMAD4-depleted cells. SMAD4 may thus modulate a network of cell adhesion proteins that stabilize the attachment of TZPs to the oocyte, thereby amplifying signalling between the two cell types.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93178">Bacterial vampirism mediated through taxis to serum</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovars, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Citrobacter koseri</i> are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96065">Neutralizing gut-derived lipopolysaccharide as a novel therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis</a></h4>

              
                Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Humans and some mammals can develop severe forms of leptospirosis accompanied by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which often results in death. The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a vital element in systemic health. However, the precise role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. Our study showed that leptospires were able to multiply in the intestine, cause pathological injury, and induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory responses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that <i>Leptospira</i> infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota of hamsters with an expansion of Proteobacteria. In addition, gut barrier permeability was increased after infection, as reflected by a decrease in the expression of tight junctions. Translocated Proteobacteria were found in the intestinal epithelium of moribund hamsters, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the serum. Moreover, gut microbiota depletion reduced the survival time, increased the leptospiral load, and promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after <i>Leptospira</i> infection. Intriguingly, fecal filtration and serum from moribund hamsters both increased the transcription of <i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-10</i>, and <i>TLR4</i> in macrophages compared with those from uninfected hamsters. These stimulating activities were inhibited by LPS neutralization using polymyxin B. Based on our findings, we identified an LPS neutralization therapy that significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis when used in combination with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy. In conclusion, our study not only uncovers the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis but also provides a therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94191">Visual working memories are abstractions of percepts</a></h4>

              
                During perception, decoding the orientation of gratings depends on complex interactions between the orientation of the grating, aperture edges, and topographic structure of the visual map. Here, we aimed to test how aperture biases described during perception affect working memory (WM) decoding. For memoranda, we used gratings multiplied by radial and angular modulators to generate orthogonal aperture biases for identical orientations. Therefore, if WM representations are simply maintained sensory representations, they would have similar aperture biases. If they are abstractions of sensory features, they would be unbiased and the modulator would have no effect on orientation decoding. Neural patterns of delay period activity while maintaining the orientation of gratings with one modulator (e.g. radial) were interchangeable with patterns while maintaining gratings with the other modulator (e.g. angular) in visual and parietal cortex, suggesting that WM representations are insensitive to aperture biases during perception. Then, we visualized memory abstractions of stimuli using models of visual field map properties. Regardless of aperture biases, WM representations of both modulated gratings were recoded into a single oriented line. These results provide strong evidence that visual WM representations are abstractions of percepts, immune to perceptual aperture biases, and compel revisions of WM theory.

                Objects in expected locations are recognised faster and more accurately than objects in incongruent environments. This congruency effect has a neural component, with increased activity for objects in incongruent environments. Studies have increasingly shown differences between neural processes in realistic environments and tasks, and neural processes in the laboratory. To what extent do findings obtained from a laboratory setting translate to neural processes elicited in real-world environments? We investigated how object recognition is modulated when objects are placed in real environments using augmented reality while recording mobile EEG. Participants approached, viewed, and rated how congruent they found the objects with the environment. We found significantly higher theta-band power for objects in incongruent contexts than objects in congruent contexts. This demonstrates that real-world contexts impact on how we recognize objects, and that mobile brain imaging and augmented reality are effective tools to study cognition in the wild.

">Time-resolved coupling between connectome harmonics and subjective experience under the psychedelic DMT</a></h4>

              
                Exploring the intricate relationship between brain's structure and function, and how this affects subjective experience is a fundamental pursuit in neuroscience. Psychedelic substances offer a unique insight into the influences of specific neurotransmitter systems on perception, cognition and consciousness. Specifically, their impact on brain function propagates across the structural connectome, a network of white matter pathways linking different regions. To comprehensively grasp the effects of psychedelic compounds on brain function, we used a theoretically rigorous framework known as connectome harmonic decomposition. This framework provides a robust method to characterize how brain function intricately depends on the organized network structure of the human connectome. We show that the connectome harmonic repertoire under DMT is reshaped in line with other reported psychedelic compounds; psilocybin, LSD and ketamine. Furthermore, we show that the repertoire entropy of connectome harmonics increases under DMT, as with those other psychedelics. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that measures of energy spectrum difference and repertoire entropy of connectome harmonics indexes the intensity of subjective experience of the participants in a time-resolved manner reflecting close coupling between connectome harmonics and subjective experience.

">Selective Labeling Meets Semi-Supervised Neuron Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                Semi-supervised learning holds promise for cost-effective neuron segmentation in Electron Microscopy (EM) volumes. This technique fully leverages extensive unlabeled data to regularize supervised training for robust predictions. However, diverse neuronal patterns and limited annotation budgets may lead to distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data, hindering the generalization of semi-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose an improved pipeline for cost-effective neuron segmentation by integrating selective labeling and semi-supervised training. For selective labeling, we present an unsupervised heuristic tailored for labeled dataset selection in EM volumes. Guided by self-supervised learning on local patches, representative sub-volumes comprising spatially associated patches are greedily selected via a coverage-based criterion. Those sub-volumes can effectively reflect unlabeled data distribution within a limited budget. For semi-supervised training, we introduce spatial mixing into neuron segmentation and integrate it within a Siamese architecture. This enhancement allows us to reinforce cross-view consistency through intra- and inter-mixing of labeled and unlabeled datasets. The proposed strategies bridge the distribution gap and encourage the model to learn shared semantics across datasets, promoting more effective semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, providing a practical and efficient solution for large-scale neuron reconstruction. Codes and data will be available.

">Strong Protection by Bazedoxifene Against Chemically-Induced Ferroptotic Neuronal Death In Vitro and In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by excessive iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis can be induced in cultured cells by exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., erastin and RSL3). Recently it was shown that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a mediator of chemically-induced ferroptosis and also a target for ferroptosis protection. In this study, we find that bazedoxifene (BAZ), a selective estrogen receptor modulator with reported neuroprotective actions in humans, can inhibit PDI function and also strongly protect against chemically-induced ferroptosis in cultured neuronal cells. We find that BAZ can directly bind to PDI in vitro and in intact neuronal cells, and also can inhibit PDIs catalytic activity. Computational modeling analysis reveals that BAZ forms a hydrogen bond with PDI-His256. Inhibition of PDI by BAZ markedly reduces nNOS and iNOS dimerization and NO accumulation, which have recently been shown to play a crucial role in mediating chemically-induced ferroptosis. In addition, the direct antioxidant activity of BAZ may also partially contribute to its protective effect against chemically-induced ferroptosis. Behavioral analysis shows that mice treated with BAZ are strongly protected against kainic acid-induced memory deficits and hippocampal neuronal damage in vivo. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that BAZ is an inhibitor of PDI and can strongly prevent chemically-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons both in vitro and in vivo. These observations offer a novel, estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for the recently-reported neuroprotective actions of BAZ in humans.

">Real-time optimization to enhance noninvasive cortical excitability assessment in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We currently lack a robust noninvasive method to measure prefrontal excitability in humans. Concurrent TMS and EEG in the prefrontal cortex is usually confounded by artifacts. Here we asked if real-time optimization could reduce artifacts and enhance a TMS-EEG measure of left prefrontal excitability. Methods: This closed-loop optimization procedure adjusts left dlPFC TMS coil location, angle, and intensity in real-time based on the EEG response to TMS. Our outcome measure was the left prefrontal early (20-60 ms) and local TMS-evoked potential (EL-TEP). Results: In 18 healthy participants, this optimization of coil angle and brain target significantly reduced artifacts by 63% and, when combined with an increase in intensity, increased EL-TEP magnitude by 75% compared to a non-optimized approach. Conclusions: Real-time optimization of TMS parameters during dlPFC stimulation can enhance the EL-TEP. Significance: Enhancing our ability to measure prefrontal excitability is important for monitoring pathological states and treatment response.

">Working memory enhancement using real-time phase-tuned transcranial alternating current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prior work has shown that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of parietooccipital alpha oscillations (8 - 14 Hz) can modulate working memory (WM) performance as a function of the phase lag to endogenous oscillations. However, leveraging this effect using real-time phase-tuned tACS was not feasible so far due to stimulation artifacts. Objectives/Hypothesis: We aimed to develop a system that tracks and adapts the phase lag between tACS and ongoing parietooccipital alpha oscillations in real-time. We hypothesized that such real-time phase-tuned tACS enhances working memory performance, depending on the phase lag. Methods: We developed real-time phase-tuned closed-loop amplitude-modulated tACS (CLAM-tACS) targeting parietooccipital alpha oscillations. CLAM-tACS was applied at six different phase lags relative to ongoing alpha oscillations while participants (N = 21) performed a working memory task. To exclude that behavioral effects of CLAM-tACS were mediated by other factors such as sensory co-stimulation, a second group of participants (N = 25) received equivalent stimulation of the forehead. Results: WM accuracy improved in a phase lag dependent manner (p < 0.05) in the group receiving parietooccipital stimulation, with the strongest enhancement observed at 330 degrees phase lag between tACS and ongoing alpha oscillations (p < 0.01, d = 0.976). Moreover, across participants, modulation of frontoparietal alpha oscillations correlated both in amplitude (p < 0.05) and phase (p < 0.05) with the modulation of WM accuracy. No such effects were observed in the control group receiving frontal stimulation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of real-time phase-tuned CLAM-tACS in modulating both brain activity and behavior, thereby paving the way for further investigation into brain-behavior relationships and the exploration of innovative therapeutic applications.

">Human sensorimotor cortex reactivates recent visuomotor experience during awake rest</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have suggested that awake rest after training is helpful in improving motor performance and memory consolidation in visuomotor learning. Re-emergence of task-related activation patterns during awake rest has been reported, which play a role in memory consolidation or perceptual learning. This study aimed to test whether such reactivation occurs after visuomotor learning in the primary sensorimotor cortex. During fMRI scanning, 42 normal participants learned visuomotor tracking, while a rotational perturbation was introduced between a cursor position and a joystick angle. This visuomotor learning block was interleaved with the control block, during which the participants passively viewed a replay of previously performed cursor movements of their own. Half of the participants used their right hand, and the other half used their left hand to control the joystick. The resting-state scans were measured before and after the visuomotor learning sessions. A multivariate pattern classifier was trained to classify task and control blocks and then tested with resting scans before and after learning. Results revealed a significant increase in the number of volumes classified as the task in the post-learning rest compared with the pre-learning, indicating a re-emergence of task-related activities. Representational similarity analysis also showed a more similar pattern of activity with the task during the post-learning rest period. Furthermore, this effect is specific to the primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand used and significantly correlated with motor improvement after rest. Our finding revealed the reactivation of task-related patterns in the primary sensorimotor cortex for offline visuomotor learning.

">Impaired Hippocampal Reactivation Preceding Robust Aβ Deposition in a Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) target amyloid-beta (A{beta}) fibrils and high molecular weight protofibrils associated with plaques, but other bioactive species may directly contribute to neural systems failure in AD. Employing hippocampal electrophysiological recordings and dynamic calcium imaging across the sleep-wake cycle in young mice expressing human A{beta} and A{beta} oligomers, we reveal marked impairments of hippocampal function long before amyloid plaques predominate. In slow wave sleep (SWS), A{beta} increased the proportion of hypoactive cells and reduced place-cell reactivation. During awake behavior, A{beta} impaired theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and drove excessive synchronization of place cell calcium fluctuations with hippocampal theta. Remarkably, the on-line impairment of hippocampal theta-gamma PAC correlated with the SWS impairment of place-cell reactivation. Together, these results identify toxic effects of A{beta} on memory encoding and consolidation processes before robust plaque deposition and support targeting soluble A{beta}-related species to treat and prevent AD.

">Upregulation of FasII underlies synergistic neuropathological and behavioral defects in a Drosophila model of myotonic dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder that has been extensively studied for decades, yet our understanding of its neuropathological aspect remains rudimentary. In this study, we characterized a novel model of DM1 neuropathology by expressing untranslated expanded CUG repeats at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. In this model, both pre- and postsynaptic expression of CUG repeats participate to induce reduction of synaptic boutons, increase of arbor disassembly and impairment of larval locomotor activity. We found that the expression of CUG repeats caused an upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule, FasII (NCAM1 in mammals), in both the motor neurons and the body wall muscles. Knockdown of fasII was sufficient to rescue bouton numbers and locomotor impairment in this model. Further analyses identified the upregulation of the FasII-C isoform as a major contributor of these phenotypes. Remarkably, overexpressing the FasII-A-PEST+ isoform rescued the synaptic and behavioral defects, likely by outcompeting the upregulated FasII-C. Our study provided the foundation for a basic mechanism of synapse dysregulation in DM1.

">Multiparametric quantitative MRI uncovers putamen microstructural changes in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder dominated by motor and non-motor dysfunction. Despite extensive research, the in vivo characterization of PD-related microstructural brain changes remains an ongoing challenge, limiting advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The putamen, a critical structure within the basal ganglia, plays a key role in regulating movement and is profoundly affected in early PD-related neurodegeneration. In this study, we collected multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) brain data of PD patients and healthy controls, to investigate microstructural alterations in the putamen in PD. We utilized a gradient analysis technique to analyze the spatial variations of various qMRI parameters, including relaxation rates (R1, R2, R2*), water fraction (WF), susceptibility, magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat), and diffusion metrics (MD, FA). Our findings reveal significant spatial gradients and interhemispheric asymmetries in these biophysical properties along the anterior-posterior axis of the putamen. Notably, PD patients exhibited increased water fraction and altered transverse relaxation rate R2*, particularly in the posterior putamen, correlated with motor symptom laterality. These microstructural changes suggest underlying tissue atrophy or neuroinflammatory processes associated with PD. The study underscores the importance of the posterior putamen as a focal point for PD pathology and highlights the potential of localized gradient analysis in detecting subtle yet clinically significant brain changes. The new qMRI dataset provides valuable insights into PD pathology, potentially aiding in the development of more precise diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.

">BOLD Contrast Response Characteristics of Aberrant Voxels with Bilateral Visual Population Receptive Fields in Human Albinism</a></h4>

              
                Albinism is an inherited disorder characterized by disrupted melanin production in the eye, and often in the skin and hair. This retinal hypopigmentation is accompanied by pathological decussation of many temporal retinal afferents at the optic chiasm during development, ultimately resulting in partially superimposed representations of opposite visual hemifields in each cortical hemisphere. Within these aberrant regions of hemifield overlap, individual voxels have been shown to have bilateral, dual population receptive fields (pRFs) responding to roughly mirror-image locations across the vertical meridian. Nonetheless, how these two conflicting inputs combine to determine a voxel's response to image contrast is still unknown. To address this, we stimulated the right and left hemifields with separately controlled sinusoidal gratings, each having a variety of contrasts (0, 8, 20, 45, 100%), and extracted voxel-wise BOLD response amplitudes to each contrast combination in visual areas V1-V3. We then compared voxels' responses to each hemifield stimulated individually with conditions when both hemifields were stimulated simultaneously. We hypothesized that simultaneous stimulation of the two pRF components will result in either a suppressive or facilitative interaction. However, we found that BOLD responses to simultaneous stimulation appeared to reflect simple summation of the neural activity from the individual hemifield conditions. This suggests that the superimposed opposite hemifield representations do not interact. Thus, dual pRFs in albinism likely reflect two co-localized, but functionally independent populations of neurons each of which respond to a single hemifield. This finding is commensurate with psychophysical studies which have shown no clear perceptual interaction between opposite visual hemifields in human albinism.

">Cued probabilistic expectations do not modulate grating-evoked event-related potentials in the visual system</a></h4>

              
                We can rapidly learn recurring patterns that occur within our sensory environments. This knowledge allows us to form expectations about future sensory events. Several influential predictive coding models posit that, when a stimulus matches our expectations, the activity of feature-selective neurons in visual cortex will be suppressed relative to when that stimulus is unexpected. However, after accounting for known critical confounds, there is currently scant evidence for these hypothesised effects from studies recording electrophysiological neural activity. To provide a strong test for expectation effects on stimulus-evoked responses in visual cortex, we performed a probabilistic cueing experiment while recording electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (n=48) learned associations between visual cues and subsequently presented gratings. A given cue predicted the appearance of a certain grating orientation with 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90% validity. We did not observe any stimulus expectancy effects on grating-evoked event-related potentials. Bayes factors generally favoured the null hypothesis throughout the time-courses of the grating-evoked responses. Multivariate classifiers trained to discriminate between grating orientations also did not substantively differ in their performance across stimulus expectancy conditions. Our null findings provide further evidence against modulations of prediction error signalling by probabilistic expectations as specified in contemporary predictive coding models.

">Amplitude entropy captures chimera-like behavior in epileptic seizure dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by epileptic seizures, which manifest with localized high-synchrony, high-amplitude activity that spreads from an onset zone to the rest of the epileptic network. Chimeras, defined as states of co-occurring synchrony and asynchrony in symmetrically coupled networks are increasingly invoked for characterization of seizures. In particular, chimera-like states have been observed during the transition from a normal (asynchronous) to a seizure (synchronous) network state. However, chimeras in epilepsy have only been investigated with respect to the varying phases of oscillators. We propose a novel method capturing the characteristic pronounced changes in the recorded EEG amplitude during seizures by estimating chimera-like states directly from the signals in a frequency- and time-resolved manner. We test the method on a publicly available intracranial EEG dataset of 16 patients with focal epilepsy. We show that the proposed measure, titled Amplitude Entropy, is sensitive to seizure onset dynamics, demonstrating its significant increases during seizure as compared to before and after seizure. This finding is robust across patients, their seizures, and different frequency bands. In the future, Amplitude Entropy could serve as a tool for seizure detection, but also help to characterize amplitude chimeras in other networked systems with characteristic amplitude dynamics.

">Learning Conjunctive Representations</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing patterns, which has led to the suggestion that they encode an animal's location. However, place cells also respond to contextual cues, such as smell. Furthermore, they have the ability to remap, wherein the firing fields and rates of cells change in response to environmental changes. How place cell responses emerge, and how these representations remap is not fully understood. In this work, we propose a similarity-based objective function that translates proximity in space, to proximity in representation. We show that a neural network trained to minimize the proposed objective learns place-like representations. We also show that the proposed objective is trivially extended to include other sources of information, such as context information, in the same way. When trained to encode multiple contexts, networks learn distinct representations, exhibiting remapping behaviors between contexts. The proposed objective is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Such transformations of the original trained representation (e.g. rotations), therefore yield new representations distinct from the original, without explicit relearning, akin to remapping. Our findings shed new light on the formation and encoding properties of place cells, and also demonstrate an interesting case of representational reuse.

                This research investigates whether ventricular-focused ultrasound stimulation (ventricle-FUS) can serve as an effective control in studies using transcranial FUS, a non-invasive technology for brain modulation. FUS has notable potential for therapeutic applications but requires a robust control to accurately assess its effects. We evaluated the effectiveness of ventricle-FUS, as an active, non-cerebrum control for FUS research, comparing it to sham stimulation. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of ventricle-FUS, employing both questionnaires and multiple neuroimaging metrics such as grey matter and white matter volumes, and functional connectivity. Ventricle-FUS did not alter any of these metrics, thereby successfully retaining the auditory, somatosensory, and experiential elements of FUS without affecting brain structure or function. Importantly, participants were unable to distinguish whether they received ventricle-FUS or sham FUS. Our findings confirm that ventricle-FUS establishes it as a reliable control approach in FUS research, crucial for advancing its therapeutic applications

">Cognitive Computational Model Reveals Repetition Bias in a Sequential Decision-Making Task</a></h4>

              
                Humans tend to repeat past actions due to rewarding outcomes. Recent computational models propose that the probability of selecting a specific action is also, in part, based on how often this action was selected before, independent of previous outcomes or reward. However, these new models so far lack empirical support. Here, we present evidence of a repetition bias using a novel sequential decision-making task and computational modeling to reveal the influence of choice frequency on human value-based choices. Specifically, we find that value-based decisions can be best explained by concurrent influence of both goal-directed reward seeking and a repetition bias. We also show that participants differ substantially in their repetition bias strength, and relate these measures to task performance. The new task enables a novel way to measure the influence of choice repetition on decision-making. These findings can serve as a basis for further experimental studies on the interplay between rewards and choice history in human decision-making.

">Single neuron contributions to the auditory brainstem EEG</a></h4>

              
                The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is an acoustically evoked EEG potential that is an important diagnostic tool for hearing loss, especially in newborns. The ABR originates from the response sequence of auditory brainstem nuclei, and a click-evoked ABR typically shows three positive peaks ('waves') within the first six milliseconds. However, an assignment of the waves of the ABR to specific sources is difficult, and a quantification of contributions to the ABR waves is not available. Here, we exploit the large size and physical separation of the barn owl first-order cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) to estimate single-cell contributions to the ABR. We simultaneously recorded NM neurons' spikes and the EEG, and found that > 5,000 spontaneous single-cell spikes are necessary to isolate a significant spike-triggered average response at the EEG electrode. An average single-neuron contribution to the ABR was predicted by convolving the spike-triggered average with the cell's peri-stimulus time histogram. Amplitudes of predicted contributions of single NM cells typically reached 32.9 nV (mean, range: 2.5 - 162.7 nV), or 0.07% (median, range: 0.01 - 4.0%) of the ABR amplitude. The time of the predicted peak coincided best with the peak of the ABR wave II, and this coincidence was independent of the click sound level. Our results suggest that wave II of the ABR is shaped by a small fraction of NM units.

">Location- and feature-based selection histories make independent, qualitatively distinct contributions to urgent visuomotor performance</a></h4>

              
                Attention mechanisms that guide visuomotor behaviors are classified into three broad types according to their reliance on stimulus salience, current goals, and selection histories (i.e., recent experience with events of many sorts). These forms of attentional control are clearly distinct and multifaceted, but what is largely unresolved is how they interact dynamically to determine impending visuomotor choices. To investigate this, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform an urgent version of an oddball search task in which a red target appears among three green distracters, or vice versa. By imposing urgency, performance can be tracked continuously as it transitions from uninformed guesses to informed choices, and this, in turn, permits assessment of attentional control as a function of time. We found that the probability of making a correct choice was strongly modulated by the histories of preceding target colors and target locations. Crucially, although both effects were gated by success (or reward), the two variables played dynamically distinct roles: whereas location history promoted an early motor bias, color history modulated the later perceptual evaluation. Furthermore, target color and location influenced performance independently of each other. The results show that, when combined, selection histories can give rise to enormous swings in visuomotor performance even in simple tasks with highly discriminable stimuli.

">Periodic ER-plasma membrane junctions support long-range Ca2+ signal integration in dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal dendrites must relay synaptic inputs over long distances, but the mechanisms by which activity-evoked intracellular signals propagate over macroscopic distances remain unclear. Here, we discovered a system of periodically arranged endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions tiling the plasma membrane of dendrites at ~1 m intervals, interlinked by a meshwork of ER tubules patterned in a ladder-like array. Populated with Junctophilin-linked plasma membrane voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and ER Ca2+-release channels (ryanodine receptors), ER-PM junctions are hubs for ER-PM crosstalk, fine-tuning of Ca2+ homeostasis, and local activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Local spine stimulation activates the Ca2+ modulatory machinery facilitating voltage-independent signal transmission and ryanodine receptor-dependent Ca2+ release at ER-PM junctions over 20 m away. Thus, interconnected ER-PM junctions support signal propagation and Ca2+ release from the spine-adjacent ER. The capacity of this subcellular architecture to modify both local and distant membrane-proximal biochemistry potentially contributes to dendritic computations.

">The diversity of SNCA transcripts in neurons, and its impact on antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                The role of the SNCA gene locus in driving Parkinsons disease (PD) through rare and common genetic variation is well-recognized, but the transcriptional diversity of SNCA in vulnerable cell types remains unclear. We performed SNCA long-read RNA sequencing in human dopaminergic neurons and show that annotated SNCA transcripts account for only 5% of expression. Rather, the majority of expression (75%) at the SNCA locus originates from transcripts with alternative 5 and 3 untranslated regions. Importantly, 10% originates from transcripts encoding open reading frames not previously annotated, which are translated and detectable in human postmortem brain. Defining the 3 untranslated regions enabled the rational design of antisense oligonucleotides targeting the majority of SNCA transcripts, leading to the effective reversal of PD pathology, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and toxicity. Resolving the complexity of the SNCA transcriptional landscape impacts RNA therapies and highlights differences in protein isoforms and their contribution to disease.

                Neuropeptides are the largest class of neuromodulators, which can be co-released together with classical neurotransmitters. It has been shown that subpopulations of dopamine neurons express mRNA for the neuropeptide Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP); however, its functional relevance in dopaminergic circuits is unknown. Here, we find that the GRP receptor (GRPR) is present in the nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAc MSh), which is targeted by GRP-expressing midbrain dopamine neurons as well as glutamatergic inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala. We show that the NAc MSh GRPR-positive cells are a subpopulation of D2 receptor-expressing neurons, which have high intrinsic excitability and can be activated by GRP in vivo. Selective deletion of Grpr from the NAc MSh increases motivation in a progressive ratio test, indicating a role for GRPR in motivated behaviors. These experiments establish GRP/GRPR signaling as a novel regulator of mesolimbic circuits and advance our understanding of neuropeptides in the striatum.

                Members of the synaptophysin and synaptogyrin family are vesicle proteins with four transmembrane domains. In spite of their abundance in synaptic vesicle (SV) membranes, their role remains elusive and only mild defects at the cellular and organismal level are observed in mice lacking one or more family members. Here, we show that co-expression with synapsin of each of the four brain-enriched members of this family - synaptophysin, synaptoporin, synaptogyrin1 and synaptogyrin3 - in fibroblasts is sufficient to generate clusters of small vesicles in the same size range of SVs. Moreover, mice lacking all these four proteins have larger SVs. We conclude that synaptophysin and synaptogyrin family proteins play an overlapping function in the biogenesis of SVs and in determining their small size.

">Excitation/Inhibition imbalance impairs multisensory causal inference by increasing the proneness to experience the sound-induced flash illusion in the schizophrenia spectrum</a></h4>

              
                The spectrum of schizophrenia is characterised by an altered sense of self with known impairments in tactile sensitivity, proprioception, body-self boundaries, and self-recognition. These are thought to be produced by failures in multisensory integration mechanisms, commonly observed as enlarged temporal binding windows during audiovisual illusion tasks. To our knowledge, there is an absence of computational explanations for multisensory integration deficits in patients with schizophrenia and individuals with high schizotypy, particularly at the neurobiological level. We implemented a multisensory causal inference network to reproduce the responses of individuals who scored low in schizotypy in a simulated double flash illusion task. Next, we explored the effects of Excitation/Inhibition imbalance, feedback weights, and synaptic density on the visual illusory responses of the network. Using quantitative fitting to empirical data, we found that an increase in recurrent excitation or cross-modal connectivity in the network enlarges the temporal binding window and increases the overall proneness to experience the illusion, matching the responses of individuals scoring high in schizotypy. Moreover, we found that an increase in the E/I balance by either neural mechanism increases the probability of inferring a common cause from the stimuli. We propose an E/I imbalance account of reduced temporal discrimination in the SCZ spectrum and discuss possible links with Bayesian theories of schizophrenia. We highlight the importance of adopting a multisensory causal inference perspective to address body-related symptomatology of schizophrenia.

">Genetic ablation of GABAB receptors from oligodendrocyte precursor cells protects against demyelination in the mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic signaling and GABAB receptors play crucial roles in regulating the physiology of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, including their proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. Therefore, they are promising targets for studying how spinal oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) respond to injuries and neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis. Taking advantage of the temporally controlled and cell-specific genetic removal of GABAB receptors from OPCs, our investigation addresses their specific influence on OPC behavior in the gray and white matter of the mouse spinal cord. Our results show that while GABAB receptors do not significantly alter OPC cell proliferation and differentiation under physiological conditions, they distinctly regulate the Ca2+ signaling of OPCs. In addition, we investigate the impact of OPC-GABAB receptors in two models of toxic demyelination, namely the cuprizone and the lysolecithin models. The genetic removal of OPC-GABAB receptors protects against demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss. Additionally, we observe enhanced resilience to cuprizone-induced pathological alterations in OPC Ca2+ signaling. Our results provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic implications of manipulating GABAB receptors in spinal cord OPCs and deepen our understanding of the interplay between GABAergic signaling and spinal cord OPCs, providing a basis for future research.

">Dysregulation of synaptic transcripts underlies network abnormalities in ALS patient-derived motor neurons</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by dysfunction and loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Several studies have identified structural and functional alterations in the motor neurons before the manifestation of symptoms, yet the underlying cause of such alterations and how they contribute to the progressive degeneration of affected motor neuron networks remain unclear. Importantly, the short and long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal network activity make it challenging to discern how ALS-related network reconfigurations emerge and evolve. To address this, we systematically monitored the structural and functional dynamics of motor neuron networks with a confirmed endogenous C9orf72 mutation. We show that ALS patient-derived motor neurons display time-dependent neural network dysfunction, specifically reduced firing rate and spike amplitude, impaired bursting, but higher overall synchrony in network activity. These changes coincided with altered neurite outgrowth and branching within the networks. Moreover, transcriptional analyses revealed dysregulation of molecular pathways involved in synaptic development and maintenance, neurite outgrowth and cell adhesion, suggesting impaired synaptic stabilization. This study identifies early synaptic dysfunction as a contributing mechanism resulting in network-wide structural and functional compensation, which may over time render the networks vulnerable to neurodegeneration.

">Bifurcation enhances temporal information encoding in the olfactory periphery</a></h4>

              
                Living systems continually respond to signals from the surrounding environment. Survival requires that their responses adapt quickly and robustly to the changes in the environment. One particularly challenging example is olfactory navigation in turbulent plumes, where animals experience highly intermittent odor signals while odor concentration varies over many length- and timescales. Here, we show theoretically that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) can exploit proximity to a bifurcation point of their firing dynamics to reliably extract information about the timing and intensity of fluctuations in the odor signal, which have been shown to be critical for odor-guided navigation. Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently. Importantly, we find that proximity to the bifurcation is maintained by mean adaptation alone and therefore does not require any additional feedback mechanism or fine-tuning. Using a biophysical model with calcium-based feedback, we demonstrate that this mechanism can explain the measured adaptation characteristics of Drosophila ORNs.

">DENOISING: Dynamic Enhancement and Noise Overcoming in Multimodal Neural Observations via High-density CMOS-based Biosensors</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale multimodal neural recordings on high-density biosensing microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) offer unprecedented insights into the dynamic interactions and connectivity across various brain networks. However, the fidelity of these recordings is frequently compromised by pervasive noise, which obscures meaningful neural information and complicates data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce DENOISING, a versatile data-derived computational engine engineered to adjust thresholds adaptively based on large-scale extracellular signal characteristics and noise levels. This facilitates the separation of signal and noise components without reliance on specific data transformations. Uniquely capable of handling a diverse array of noise types (electrical, mechanical, and environmental) and multidimensional neural signals, including stationary and non-stationary oscillatory local field potential (LFP) and spiking activity, DENOISING presents an adaptable solution applicable across different recording modalities and brain networks. Applying DENOISING to large-scale neural recordings from mice hippocampal and olfactory bulb networks yielded enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of LFP and spike firing patterns compared to those computed from raw data. Comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art denoising methods, employing SNR and root mean square noise (RMS), underscores DENOISING's performance in improving data quality and reliability. Through experimental and computational approaches, we validate that DENOISING improves signal clarity and data interpretation by effectively mitigating independent noise in spatiotemporally structured multimodal datasets, thus unlocking new dimensions in understanding neural connectivity and functional dynamics.

">Predicting Suicide Risk in Bipolar Disorder patients from Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines genetic signatures</a></h4>

              
                This research investigates the genetic signatures associated with a high risk of suicide in Bipolar disorder (BD) patients through RNA sequencing analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). By identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their enrichment in pathways and disease associations, we uncover insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying suicidal behavior. LCL gene expression analysis reveals significant enrichment in pathways related to primary immunodeficiency, ion channel, and cardiovascular defects. Notably, genes such as LCK, KCNN2, and GRIA1 emerged as pivotal in these pathways, suggesting their potential roles as biomarkers. Machine learning models trained on a subset of the patients and then tested on other patients demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing low and high-risk of suicide in BD patients. Moreover, the study explores the genetic overlap between suicide-related genes and several psychiatric disorders. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and suicidal behavior, laying the groundwork for future prevention strategies.

">Theoretical proposal for restoration of hand motor function utilizing plasticity of motor-cortical interhemispheric interaction</a></h4>

              
                After stroke, the poorer recovery of motor function of upper extremities compared to other body parts is a longstanding problem. Based on our recent functional MRI evidence on healthy volunteers, this perspective paper proposes systematic hand motor rehabilitation utilizing the plasticity of interhemispheric interaction between motor cortices and following its developmental rule. We first discuss the effectiveness of proprioceptive intervention on the paralyzed (immobile) hand synchronized with voluntary movement of the intact hand to induce muscle activity in the paretic hand. In healthy participants, we show that this bilateral proprioceptive-motor coupling intervention activates the bilateral motor cortices (= bilaterally active mode), facilitates interhemispheric motor-cortical functional connectivity, and augments muscle activity of the passively-moved hand. Next, we propose training both hands to perform different movements, which would be effective for stroke patients who become able to manage to move the paretic hand. This bilaterally different movement training may guide the motor cortices into left-right independent mode to improve interhemispheric inhibition and hand dexterity, because we have shown in healthy older adults that this training reactivates motor-cortical interhemispheric inhibition (= left-right independent mode) declined with age, and can improve hand dexterity. Transition of both motor cortices from the bilaterally active mode to the left-right independent mode is a developmental rule of hand motor function and a common feature of motor function recovery after stroke. Hence, incorporating the brain's inherent capacity for spontaneous recovery and adhering to developmental principles may be crucial considerations in designing effective rehabilitation strategies.

">Multiple mechanisms of aminoglycoside ototoxicity are distinguished by subcellular localization of action</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear are vulnerable to environmental insult, with damage resulting in hearing and balance disorders. Hair cells are sensitive to exposure to toxic agents including therapeutic drugs such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin and gentamicin. Here we describe distinct mechanisms for aminoglycoside-induced cell death in zebrafish lateral line hair cells. Neomycin exposure results in death from acute exposure with most cells dying within 1 hour of exposure. By contrast exposure to gentamicin results in delayed death, taking up to 24 hours for maximal effect. Washout experiments demonstrate that delayed death does not require continuous exposure, demonstrating two mechanisms where downstream responses differ in their timing. Acute damage is associated with mitochondrial calcium fluxes and can be alleviated by the mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO, while delayed death is independent of these factors. Conversely delayed death is associated with lysosomal accumulation and is reduced by altering endolysosomal function, while acute death is not sensitive to these manipulations. These experiments reveal the complexity of responses of hair cells to closely related compounds, suggesting that intervention focusing on early events rather than specific death pathways may be a successful therapeutic strategy.

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons from the brain and spinal cord. The excessive neuroinflammation is thought to be a common determinant of ALS. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is pathologically upregulated after injury/diseases to negatively regulate a broad range of cytokines/chemokines that mediate inflammation; however, the role that SOCS3 plays in ALS pathogenesis has not been explored. Here, we found that SOCS3 protein levels were significantly increased in the brainstem of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-G93A ALS mice, which is negatively related to a progressive decline in motor function from the pre-symptomatic to the early symptomatic stage. Moreover, SOCS3 levels in both cervical and lumbar spinal cords of ALS mice were also significantly upregulated at the pre-symptomatic stage and became exacerbated at the early symptomatic stage. Concomitantly, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages were progressively increased and reactivated over time. In contrast, neurons were simultaneously lost in the brainstem and spinal cord examined over the course of disease progression. Collectively, SOCS3 was first found to be upregulated during ALS progression to directly relate to both increased astrogliosis and increased neuronal loss, indicating that SOCS3 could be explored to be as a potential therapeutic target of ALS.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore the impact of the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical states of sports students from Romania and also to compare the differences according to gender and the type of sport. Initially, in order to collect demographic data and health reports, a cross-sectional survey was developed to evaluate the emotional needs of sports students during the pandemic. After the second wave, the coping strategies used by the participants to fight negative emotions were assessed using the CERQ questionnaire. The results indicate that depression symptoms are the most reported psychological issues among the participants and that there are differences according to gender concerning the cognitive schemas they use in order to reduce the symptoms. Also, it was found that there are differences, corresponding to the type of sport, in choosing adaptive coping mechanisms. Ultimately, it was confirmed that higher levels of hopelessness among sports students are associated with increased vulnerability to substance use, with the correlation between those two indicators being strong. Delving deeper into this relationship can help identify critical points for intervention to prevent substance abuse. At the same time, the dichotomic analysis of the results found as moderators&amp;amp;mdash;the gender and the type of sport in decreasing the severity of depression could be an important aspect of the next counseling interventions.</p>

                Background A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. Results Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. The levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmentally constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to therapeutic pressure or liver toxicity. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. The Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, phylogenetic and mutation analysis. A correlation test was performed to measure the association between polymerase and surface mutations. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive and 92% (N=38/41) sequenced. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]) and (24% [N=7/26]) as genotypes B, C, D, E, F, and G. Prevalence of the mutations in the Surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and vaccines escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT was at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. There was no statistical significance between S and RT mutations at P>0.005 and the statistical correlation between RT and SHB mutations was weak at 0.877. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. We provide evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance. Mutations have no statistical significance but can have clinical Implication on the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals.

                <p>by Amber Marijn Brands, Sasha Devore, Orrin Devinsky, Werner Doyle, Adeen Flinker, Daniel Friedman, Patricia Dugan, Jonathan Winawer, Iris Isabelle Anna Groen</p>

Neural responses in visual cortex adapt to prolonged and repeated stimuli. While adaptation occurs across the visual cortex, it is unclear how adaptation patterns and computational mechanisms differ across the visual hierarchy. Here we characterize two signatures of short-term neural adaptation in time-varying intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data collected while participants viewed naturalistic image categories varying in duration and repetition interval. Ventral- and lateral-occipitotemporal cortex exhibit slower and prolonged adaptation to single stimuli and slower recovery from adaptation to repeated stimuli compared to V1-V3. For category-selective electrodes, recovery from adaptation is slower for preferred than non-preferred stimuli. To model neural adaptation we augment our delayed divisive normalization (DN) model by scaling the input strength as a function of stimulus category, enabling the model to accurately predict neural responses across multiple image categories. The model fits suggest that differences in adaptation patterns arise from slower normalization dynamics in higher visual areas interacting with differences in input strength resulting from category selectivity. Our results reveal systematic differences in temporal adaptation of neural population responses between lower and higher visual brain areas and show that a single computational model of history-dependent normalization dynamics, fit with area-specific parameters, accounts for these differences.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012071">The evolution of environmentally mediated social interactions and posthumous spite under isolation by distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Mullon, Jorge Peña, Laurent Lehmann</p>

Many social interactions happen indirectly via modifications of the environment, e.g. through the secretion of functional compounds or the depletion of renewable resources. Here, we derive the selection gradient on a quantitative trait affecting dynamical environmental variables that feed back on reproduction and survival in a finite patch-structured population subject to isolation by distance. Our analysis shows that the selection gradient depends on how a focal individual influences the fitness of all future individuals in the population through modifications of the environmental variables they experience, weighted by the neutral relatedness between recipients and the focal. The evolutionarily relevant trait-driven environmental modifications are formalized as the extended phenotypic effects of an individual, quantifying how a trait change in an individual in the present affects the environmental variables in all patches at all future times. When the trait affects reproduction and survival through a payoff function, the selection gradient can be expressed in terms of extended phenotypic effects weighted by scaled relatedness. We show how to compute extended phenotypic effects, relatedness, and scaled relatedness using Fourier analysis, which allow us to investigate a broad class of environmentally mediated social interactions in a tractable way. We use our approach to study the evolution of a trait controlling the costly production of some lasting commons (e.g. a common-pool resource or a toxic compound) that can diffuse in space and persist in time. We show that indiscriminate posthumous spite readily evolves in this scenario. More generally, whether selection favours environmentally mediated altruism or spite is determined by the spatial correlation between an individual’s lineage and the commons originating from its patch. The sign of this correlation depends on interactions between dispersal patterns and the commons’ renewal dynamics. More broadly, we suggest that selection can favour a wide range of social behaviours when these have carry-over effects in space and time.

                <p>by Yahaya A Yabo, Dieter Henrik Heiland</p>

Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.

                <p>by Yatian Chen, Jiayue Gu, Biao Yang, Lili Yang, Jie Pang, Qinghua Luo, Yirong Li, Danyang Li, Zixin Deng, Changjiang Dong, Haohao Dong, Zhengyu Zhang</p>

The peptidoglycan (PG) layer is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and serves as an important target for antibiotics in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The hydrolysis of septal PG (sPG) is a crucial step of bacterial cell division, facilitated by FtsEX through an amidase activation system. In this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsEX and FtsEX-EnvC in the ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.05 Å and 3.11 Å, respectively. Our PG degradation assays in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> reveal that the ATP-bound conformation of FtsEX activates sPG hydrolysis of EnvC-AmiB, whereas EnvC-AmiB alone exhibits autoinhibition. Structural analyses indicate that ATP binding induces conformational changes in FtsEX-EnvC, leading to significant differences from the apo state. Furthermore, PG degradation assays of AmiB mutants confirm that the regulation of AmiB by FtsEX-EnvC is achieved through the interaction between EnvC-AmiB. These findings not only provide structural insight into the mechanism of sPG hydrolysis and bacterial cell division, but also have implications for the development of novel therapeutics targeting drug-resistant bacteria.

                <p>by Arianna Zuanazzi, Pablo Ripollés, Wy Ming Lin, Laura Gwilliams, Jean-Rémi King, David Poeppel</p>

Combinatoric linguistic operations underpin human language processes, but how meaning is composed and refined in the mind of the reader is not well understood. We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (“not”) and intensifiers (“really”) on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., “good”) in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal significant above chance decoding accuracy for negated adjectives within 600 ms from adjective onset, suggesting that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., “not bad” represented as “good”); furthermore, decoding accuracy for negated adjectives is found to be significantly lower than that for affirmative adjectives. Overall, these results suggest that negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.

The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas12a has become a powerful genome-editing tool in biomedical research due to its ease of use and low off-targeting. However, the size of Cas12a severely limits clinical applications such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy. Here, we characterized a novel compact Cas12a ortholog, termed EbCas12a, from the metagenome-assembled genome of a currently unclassified <i>Erysipelotrichia</i>. It has the PAM sequence of 5′-TTTV-3′ (V = A, G, C) and the smallest size of approximately 3.47 kb among the Cas12a orthologs reported so far. In addition, enhanced EbCas12a (enEbCas12a) was also designed to have comparable editing efficiency with higher specificity to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in mammalian cells at multiple target sites. Based on the compact enEbCas12a, an all-in-one AAV delivery system with crRNA for Cas12a was developed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Overall, the novel smallest high-fidelity enEbCas12a, this first case of the all-in-one AAV delivery for Cas12a could greatly boost future gene therapy and scientific research.

                <p>by Marlen C. Rice, Andrew J. Janik, Nels C. Elde, James A. Gagnon, Keir M. Balla</p>

Zebrafish are popular research organisms selected for laboratory use due in part to widespread availability from the pet trade. Many contemporary colonies of laboratory zebrafish are maintained in aquaculture facilities that monitor and aim to curb infections that can negatively affect colony health and confound experiments. The impact of laboratory control on the microbial constituents associated with zebrafish in research environments compared to the pet trade are unclear. Diseases of unknown causes are common in both environments. We conducted a metatranscriptomic survey to broadly compare the zebrafish-associated microbes in pet trade and laboratory environments. We detected many microbes in animals from the pet trade that were not found in laboratory animals. Cohousing experiments revealed several transmissible microbes including a newly described non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the Birnaviridae family we name Rocky Mountain birnavirus (RMBV). Infections were detected in asymptomatic animals from the pet trade, but when transmitted to laboratory animals RMBV was associated with pronounced antiviral responses and hemorrhagic disease. These experiments highlight the pet trade as a distinct source of diverse microbes that associate with zebrafish and establish a paradigm for the discovery of newly described pathogenic viruses and other infectious microbes that can be developed for study in the laboratory.

                Background Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) ion release, and surface topography change from the orthodontic wire are the initial processes of corrosion that may affect the mechanical properties of the archwire. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of CHX, NaF, and chitosan on the corrosion of CuNiTi wire nickel and copper ions released, surface roughness change, and archwire deflection. Methods Ninety samples of CuNiTi Tanzo™ archwires were divided into five groups according to their immersion solution: Artificial Saliva, CHX, NaF, CHX-NaF, and chitosan group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (n=6) corresponding immersion time, i.e., two, four, and six weeks. The corrosion of the samples was analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and universal testing machine (UTM). Results The amount of nickel ion releases was increasing, but the copper ion releases were reduced by the time of observations. The highest nickel ion was released in the CHX-NaF group and the lowest in the chitosan group for six-week immersion. It also corresponded to the surface topography by SEM analysis which showed the most extended cracks and deep pits in the CHX-NaF group and a smoother surface in the chitosan group. Copper ion release showed the highest ion release in the NaF group and the lowest release in the chitosan group. The unloading force of CuNiTi archwire deflection remains the same at week two and week four for all mouthwashes. Conclusion The use of mouthwashes that contained CHX, NaF, and chitosan could further alter the passive layer and cause higher nickel and copper ion release and increased CuNiTi archwire surface structure porosity. But there is no distinction between mouthwashes to release the unloading force within two until four weeks.

                Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are well-recognised antidiabetic medications among clinicians due to its highly protective effects on cardiovascular and renal systems on diabetic patients. However, one of its uncommonly reported side effects is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) which is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, ketosis and acidosis. Chest pain as a clinical presentation of EuDKA has been rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a 46-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia presented to the hospital with central chest pain that radiates to the back and is associated with mild shortness of breath and one bout of vomiting. She had been taking dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for four years. She was found to have a blood glucose level of 7 mmol\L, high anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria. Toxicology screening was unremarkable. She was diagnosed as a case of SGLT2-induced EuDKA and was treated with fluid, insulin and potassium chloride (KCL). Her hospital course went smoothly. Dapagloflzi was discontinued, and she was discharged home on oral metformin and subcutaneous insulin. This study highlights the rare occurance of chest pain as a presentation of EuDKA, an uncommon side effect of the widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. Chest pain in patients using SGLT2 Inhibitors should raise the clinician’s suspicion for possible EuDKA.

                Chronic respiratory diseases often necessitate lung transplantation due to irreversible damage. Organ engineering offers hope through stem cell-based organ generation. However, the crucial sterilization step in scaffold preparation poses challenges. This study conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the extracellular matrix (ECM) conditions of decellularised lungs subjected to different sterilisation processes. A search was performed for articles published in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and SciELO databases according to the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, five articles that presented positive results regarding the effectiveness of the sterilisation process were selected, some of which identified functional damage in the ECM. Was possible concluded that regardless of the type of agent used, physical or chemical, all of them demonstrated that sterilisation somehow harms the ECM. An ideal protocol has not been found to be fully effective in the sterilisation of pulmonary scaffolds for use in tissue and/or organ engineering.

                Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Anopheles are the only vectors of human malaria. Anopheles gibbinsi has been linked to malaria transmission in Kenya, with recent collections in Zambia reporting the mosquito species exhibiting zoophilic and exophilic behavioral patterns with occasional contact with humans. Given the paucity of genetic data, and challenges to identification and molecular taxonomy of the mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles genus; we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of An. gibbinsi using a genome skimming approach. An Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform was used for sequencing, the length of the mitochondrial genome was 15401 bp, with 78.5% AT content comprised of 37 genes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood using concatenation of the 13 protein coding genes demonstrated that An. marshallii was the closest relative based on existing sequence data. This study demonstrates that the skimming approach is an inexpensive and efficient approach for mosquito species identification and concurrent taxonomic rectification, which may be a useful alternative for generating reference sequence data for evolutionary studies among the Culicidae.

<p>In the developing chick pallium, input neurons located in the entopallium (top, green region) are born from lateral and ventral pallial (LP and VP) precursors (bottom left, blue). LP- and VP-derived neurons then receive thalamic axons around E10 and are specified into input neurons by receiving neuronal activity from thalamic axon within the entopallium E11 onward (bottom right, green cells)

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During development, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors play important roles in neuronal differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms in nonmammalian species remain largely unknown. We here investigated the mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of sensory input neurons in the chick entopallium, which receives its primary visual input via the tectofugal pathway from the nucleus rotundus. The results obtained revealed that input neurons in the entopallium expressed Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 5 (KCNH5/EAG2) mRNA from embryonic day (E) 11. On the other hand, the onset of protein expression was E20, which was 1 day before hatching. We confirm that entopallium input neurons in chicks were generated during early neurogenesis in the lateral and ventral ventricular zones. Notably, neurons derived from the lateral (LP) and ventral pallium (VP) exhibited a spatially distinct distribution along the rostro–caudal axis. We further demonstrated that the expression of EAG2 was directly regulated by input activity from thalamic axons. Collectively, the present results reveal that thalamic input activity is essential for specifying input neurons among LP- and VP-derived early-generated neurons in the developing chick entopallium.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Pioneering investigations in the mid-19th century revealed that the perception of tactile cues presented to the surface of the skin improves with training, which is referred to as tactile learning. Surprisingly, tactile learning also occurs for body parts and skin locations that are not physically involved in the training. For example, after training of a finger, tactile learning transfers to adjacent untrained fingers. This suggests that the transfer of tactile learning follows a somatotopic pattern and involves brain regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in which the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations are represented close to each other. However, other results showed that transfer occurs between body parts that are not represented close to each other in S1—for example, between the hand and the foot. These and similar findings have led to the suggestion of additional cortical mechanisms to explain the transfer of tactile learning. Here, different mechanisms are reviewed, and the extent to which they can explain the transfer of tactile learning is discussed. What all of these mechanisms have in common is that they assume a representational or functional relationship between the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations. However, none of these mechanisms alone can explain the complex pattern of transfer results, and it is likely that different mechanisms interact to enable transfer, perhaps in concert with higher somatosensory and decision-making areas.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 6; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-733/v3?src=rss">Identification of predictive factors for surgical site infections in gastrointestinal surgeries: A retrospective cross-sectional study in a resource-limited setting [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgical site infection (SSI), albeit infrequent, drastically impacts the quality of care. This article endeavors to investigate the predictive factors of SSIs following surgical interventions that involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within a single institution in a resource-limited setting. Methods Over seven years from June 2015 to June 2022, patients who underwent GI surgery and developed SSI were retrospectively matched with an unaffected case-control cohort of patients. Standardized techniques for wound culture, laboratory evaluation of bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were employed. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the predictive factors associated with 30-day postoperative SSI occurrence. Results A total of 525 patients who underwent GI surgical procedures were included, among whom, 86 (16.4%) developed SSI and the majority of SSIs were superficial (74.4%). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacterium (54.4%), and a high percentage of multidrug-resistant organisms were observed (63.8%). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, illiteracy (Odds ratio [OR]:40.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.54-170.26), smoking (OR: 21.15; 95% CI: 4.63-96.67), diabetes (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 2.27-11.35), leukocytosis (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24-5.53), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.35-10.16), contaminated and dirty wounds (OR: 6.51; 95% CI:1.62-26.09), longer operation duration (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), emergency operations (OR: 12.58; 95% CI: 2.91-54.30), and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.28-7.10) were the independent risk factors for SSI (all p < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights significant predictors of SSI, including illiteracy, smoking, diabetes, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, contaminated and dirty wounds, longer operative time, emergency operations, and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Identifying these risk factors can help surgeons adopt appropriate measures to reduce postoperative SSI and improve the quality of surgical care, especially in a resource-limited setting with no obvious and strict policy for reducing SSI.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The plains vizcacha, <i>Lagostomus maximus</i>, is a precocial hystricomorph rodent with a gyrencephalic brain. This work aimed to perform a time-lapse analysis of the embryonic brain cortical development in the plains vizcacha to establish a species-specific temporal window for corticogenesis and the gyrencephaly onset. Additionally, a comparative examination with evolutionarily related rodents was conducted. Embryos from 40 embryonic days (ED) until the end of pregnancy (∼$\sim $154 ED) were evaluated. The neuroanatomical examination determined transverse sulci at 80 ED and rostral lateral and caudal intraparietal sulci around 95 ED. Histological examination of corticogenesis showed emergence of the subplate at 43 ED and expansion of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and its division into inner and outer SVZs around 54 ED. The neocortical layers formation followed an inside-to-outside spatiotemporal gradient beginning with the emergence of layers VI and V at 68 ED and establishing the final six neocortical layers around 100 ED. A progressive increment of gyrencephalization index (GI) from 1.005 ± 0.003 around 70 ED, which reflects a smooth cortex, up to 1.07 ± 0.009 at the end of gestation, reflecting a gyrencephalic neuroanatomy, was determined. Contrarily, the minimum cortical thickness (MCT) progressively decreased from 61 ED up to the end of gestation. These results show that the decrease in the cortical thickness, which enables the onset of neocortical invaginations, occurs together with the expansion and subdivision of the SVZ. The temporal comparison of corticogenesis in plains vizcacha with that in relative species reflects a prenatal long process compared with other rodents that may give an evolutionary advantage to <i>L. maximus</i> as a precocial species.</p>

                Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) controls cholesterol homeostasis. To assess the feasibility of a PCSK9-based heart attack vaccine, Zhang et al. create a PCSK9 mimic and demonstrate in mice and NHPs its ability to significantly reduce cholesterol. Unexpectedly, the vaccine-induced antibodies also altered the PCSK9 half-life, blunting vaccine impact.

                Hulin-Curtis et al. demonstrate that a single targeted mutation in an HLA-DR1-presented epitope enhances control of primary influenza infection and long-term immunity after heterosubtypic re-challenge in HLA-DR1 mice. Enhanced protection appears to be mainly mediated by lung-derived T cells.

Next to microglia, astrocytes emerge as a key signaling partner in this disease environment, interacting with both microglia and neurons. By interrogating signaling pathways, this study highlights the role activated astrocytes play in disrupting neuronal signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81875">Fetal growth delay caused by loss of non-canonical imprinting is resolved late in pregnancy and culminates in offspring overgrowth</a></h4>

              
                Germline epigenetic programming, including genomic imprinting, substantially influences offspring development. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from <i>Eed</i>-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen-enriched cell population, and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency, and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter <i>Slc38a4</i> was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of <i>Eed</i> in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91533">Theoretical principles explain the structure of the insect head direction circuit</a></h4>

              
                To navigate their environment, insects need to keep track of their orientation. Previous work has shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is just an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91711">The larva and adult of Helicoverpa armigera use differential gustatory receptors to sense sucrose</a></h4>

              
                Almost all herbivorous insects feed on plants and use sucrose as a feeding stimulant, but the molecular basis of their sucrose reception remains unclear. <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. In this study, we determined that the sucrose sensory neurons located in the contact chemosensilla on larval maxillary galea were 100–1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those on adult antennae, tarsi, and proboscis. Using the <i>Xenopus</i> expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas9, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt toward the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94315">Neurexins control the strength and precise timing of glycinergic inhibition in the auditory brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Neurexins play diverse functions as presynaptic organizers in various glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. However, it remains unknown whether and how neurexins are involved in shaping functional properties of the glycinergic synapses, which mediate prominent inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. To address these issues, we examined the role of neurexins in a model glycinergic synapse between the principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and the principal neuron in the lateral superior olive (LSO) in the auditory brainstem. Combining RNAscope with stereotactic injection of AAV-Cre in the MNTB of neurexin1/2/3 conditional triple knockout mice, we showed that MNTB neurons highly express all isoforms of neurexins although their expression levels vary remarkably. Selective ablation of all neurexins in MNTB neurons not only reduced the amplitude but also altered the kinetics of the glycinergic synaptic transmission at LSO neurons. The synaptic dysfunctions primarily resulted from an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of release and a loosened coupling between voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles. Together, our current findings demonstrate that neurexins are essential in controlling the strength and temporal precision of the glycinergic synapse, which therefore corroborates the role of neurexins as key presynaptic organizers in all major types of fast chemical synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90316">Proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of the TRMT1 tRNA modification enzyme by SARS-CoV-2 main protease</a></h4>

              
                Nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings provide evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89353">H1 restricts euchromatin-associated methylation pathways from heterochromatic encroachment</a></h4>

              
                Silencing pathways prevent transposable element (TE) proliferation and help to maintain genome integrity through cell division. Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT DNA methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an <i>h1</i> mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase, Pol V. Loss of H1 resulted in NRPE1 enrichment predominantly in heterochromatic TEs. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in <i>h1</i>, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an <i>h1/nrpe1</i> double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in <i>h1</i> corresponded to the loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 similarly restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader, SUVH1, and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.

	<p>Researchers have long recognized that friends tend to exhibit behaviors that are more similar to each other than to those of non-friends. In recent years, the concept of neural similarity or neural synchrony among friends has garnered significant attention. This body of research bifurcates into two primary areas of focus: the specificity of neural similarity among friends (vs. non-friends) and the situational factors that influence neural synchrony among friends. This review synthesizes the complex findings to date, highlighting consistencies and identifying gaps in the current understanding. It aims to provide a coherent overview of the nuanced interplay between social relationships and neural processes, offering valuable insights for future investigations in this field.</p>

	<p>Disease prediction is greatly challenged by the scarcity of datasets and privacy concerns associated with real medical data. An approach that stands out to circumvent this hurdle is the use of synthetic data generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs can increase data volume while generating synthetic datasets that have no direct link to personal information. This study pioneers the use of GANs to create synthetic datasets and datasets augmented using traditional augmentation techniques for our binary classification task. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of our novel Conditional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (C-DCNN) model in classifying brain tumors by leveraging these augmented and synthetic datasets. We utilized advanced GAN models, including Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), to produce synthetic data that retained essential characteristics of the original datasets while ensuring privacy protection. Our C-DCNN model was trained on both augmented and synthetic datasets, and its performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3. The evaluation metrics demonstrated that our C-DCNN model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 99% on both synthetic and augmented images, outperforming the comparative models. The findings of this study highlight the potential of using GAN-generated synthetic data in enhancing the training of machine learning models for medical image classification, particularly in scenarios with limited data available. This approach not only improves model accuracy but also addresses privacy concerns, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical applications in disease prediction and diagnosis.</p>

	<p>In non-clinical populations, facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) may vary in their contribution to face identity perception. Changes to whole faces are easier to detect than changes to individual features, and eye changes are typically easier to detect than mouth changes, which in turn are easier to detect than nose changes. However, how this differs for people with face recognition difficulties (developmental prosopagnosia; DP) and for individuals with superior face recognition abilities (super-recognisers; SR) is not clear; although findings from previous studies have suggested differences, the nature of this difference is not understood. The aim of this study was to examine whether differences in the ability to detect feature changes in DPs and SRs were (a) quantitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes remained the same but there was an overall upwards or downwards shift in performance, or (b) qualitative, meaning that the pattern across feature changes was different. Using a change detection task in which individual face features (eyes, nose, mouth) changed between sequentially presented faces, we found that while prosopagnosics showed a quantitative difference in performance with a downwards shift across all conditions, super-recognisers only showed qualitative differences: they were better able to detect when the face was the same and were marginally (but not non-significantly) worse at detecting when the eyes changed. Further, the only condition which distinguished between the three groups was the ability to identify when the same face was presented, with SRs being better than controls, and controls being better than DPs. Our findings suggest that, in feature-matching tasks, differences for DPs are due to them being overall worse at the task, while SRs use a qualitatively different strategy.</p>

	<p>Research supports the efficacy of therapeutic hypnosis for reducing acute and chronic pain. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. This paper provides a review of the evidence regarding the role that electroencephalogram-assessed bandwidth power has in identifying who might benefit the most from hypnotic analgesia and how these effects occur. Findings are discussed in terms of the slow wave hypothesis, which posits that brain activity in slower bandwidths (e.g., theta and alpha) can facilitate hypnosis responsivity. Although the extant research is limited by small sample sizes, the findings from this research are generally consistent with the slow wave hypothesis. More research, including and especially studies with larger sample sizes, is needed to confirm these preliminary positive findings.</p>

	<p>Developmental changes in functional neural networks are sensitive to environmental influences. This EEG study investigated how infant brain responses relate to the social context that their families live in. Event-related potentials of 255 healthy, awake infants between six and fourteen months were measured during a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Infants were presented with 200 standard tones and 48 randomly distributed deviants. All infants are part of a longitudinal study focusing on families with socioeconomic and/or cultural challenges (Bremen Initiative to Foster Early Childhood Development; BRISE; Germany). As part of their familial socioeconomic status (SES), parental level of education and infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s migration background were assessed with questionnaires. For 30.6% of the infants both parents had a low level of education (&amp;amp;le;10 years of schooling) and for 43.1% of the infants at least one parent was born abroad. The N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex is associated with unintentional directing of attention to deviant stimuli and was analysed in frontocentral brain regions. Age was utilised as a control variable. Our results show that tone deviations in infants trigger an immature N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex. Contrary to studies with older children or adults, the N2 amplitude was more positive for deviants than for standards. This may be related to an immature superposition of the N2 with the P3a. For infants whose parents had no high-school degree and were born abroad, this tendency was increased, indicating that facing multiple challenges as a young family impacts on the infant&amp;amp;rsquo;s early neural development. As such, attending to unexpected stimulus changes may be important for early learning processes. Variations of the infant N2&amp;amp;ndash;P3a complex may, thus, relate to early changes in attentional capacity and learning experiences due to familial challenges. This points towards the importance of early prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Mood disorders and substance use disorder (SUD) are of immense medical and social concern. Although significant progress on neuronal involvement in mood and reward circuitries has been achieved, it is only relatively recently that the role of glia in these disorders has attracted attention. Detailed understanding of the glial functions in these devastating diseases could offer novel interventions. Here, following a brief review of circuitries involved in mood regulation and reward perception, the specific contributions of neurotrophic factors, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota to these diseases are highlighted. In this context, the role of specific glial cells (e.g., microglia, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and synantocytes) on phenotypic manifestation of mood disorders or SUD are emphasized. In addition, use of this knowledge in the potential development of novel therapeutics is touched upon.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in treating sleep disorders in PD. It included 24 patients with PD who had sleep disorders. Group allocations (active or sham with a ratio of 2:1) were placed in serially numbered closed envelopes. Each patient was evaluated with the following: MDS-UPDRS, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and polysomnography (PSG) before and 10 days after the treatment sessions. Each session consisted of 10 trains, 20 Hz, 10 sec for each, over the parietal cortex (bilaterally). Scores of UPDRS, BDI, and PDSS improved significantly in the active group but not in the sham group. The PSG data showed that sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latencies (min), REM duration, and time spent awake (both as %TST) were improved after rTMS in the active group compared with the sham group. The number of awakenings, the wake-after-sleep onset index, the arousal index, and periodic leg movements (PLMs) were all significantly reduced in the active group but not in the sham group. Ten sessions of 20 Hz rTMS over parietal cortexes improved sleep quality and PLMs in patients with PD. The improvement in PSG and PDSS were correlated with improvements in UPDRS and BDI scores.</p>

	<p>To date, most studies examined the effects of cold water immersion (CWI) on neuromuscular control following exercise solely on measuring proprioception, no study explores changes in the brain and muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CWI following exercise on knee neuromuscular control capacity, and physiological and perceptual responses. In a crossover control design, fifteen participants performed an exhaustion exercise. Subsequently, they underwent a 10 min recovery intervention, either in the form of passively seated rest (CON) or CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C. The knee proprioception, oxygenated cerebral hemoglobin concentrations (&amp;amp;Delta;[HbO]), and muscle activation during the proprioception test, physiological and perceptual responses were measured. CWI did not have a significant effect on proprioception at the post-intervention but attenuated the reductions in &amp;amp;Delta;[HbO] in the primary sensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The root mean square of vastus medialis was higher in the CWI compared to the CON. CWI effectively reduced core temperature and mean skin temperature and improved the rating of perceived exertion and thermal sensation. These results indicated that 10 min of CWI at 15 &amp;amp;deg;C post-exercise had no negative effect on the neuromuscular control of the knee joint but could improve subjective perception and decrease body temperature.</p>

                Background This study compares propellant fuels’ specific thrust and impulse parameters using nanocarbon variant fuels from coconut shells and coal. Specific impulses and impulses are essential parameters that determine rocket performance. The specific thrust and impulses are influenced by fuel type, material composition, heat flow, and burning time parameters. The characteristics of nanocarbon as a fuel are proven to have high-value features and a long combustion time. This parameter is essential to add value to specific thrusts and impulses. Methods The method to prove the quality of solid fuel material was done experimentally. The composition of the propellant fuel variant mixed with Ammonium Perchlorate (NH4ClO4) as an oxidizer through the printing process and sample testing was carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), combustion time, and specific impulse tests. Results Test results with the composition of CBK2 (Coconut Shell + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 267 seconds or an increase of 37 seconds without carbon. CBB2 (Coal + NH4ClO4 + Binder + Al = 15: 70: 10: 5) produced a specific impulse of 261 seconds or an increase of 31 seconds. Conclusions The composition of nanocarbon as a solid fuel propellant has been proven to increase a rocket’s thrust and specific impulses. After all the material variants have been tested for thrust and specific impulse, the best rocket propellant is CBK2.

                We develop a thermodynamic model describing the binding of RNA binding proteins (RBP) to oligomers in vitro. We apply expectation-maximization to infer the specificity of RBPs, represented as position-specific weight matrices (PWMs), by maximizing the likelihood of RNA Bind’n Seq data from the ENCODE project. Analyzing these public data we find sequence motifs that can partly explain the data for more than half of the studied 111 RBPs, and for 48 of the proteins these motifs are consistent with the known specificity. Our code is publicly available, facilitating analysis of RBP binding data.

The field of 3D genome organization produces large amounts of sequencing data from Hi-C and a rapidly-expanding set of other chromosome conformation protocols (3C+). Massive and heterogeneous 3C+ data require high-performance and flexible processing of sequenced reads into contact pairs. To meet these challenges, we present <i>pairtools</i>–a flexible suite of tools for contact extraction from sequencing data. <i>Pairtools</i> provides modular command-line interface (CLI) tools that can be flexibly chained into data processing pipelines. The core operations provided by <i>pairtools</i> are parsing of.sam alignments into Hi-C pairs, sorting and removal of PCR duplicates. In addition, <i>pairtools</i> provides auxiliary tools for building feature-rich 3C+ pipelines, including contact pair manipulation, filtration, and quality control. Benchmarking <i>pairtools</i> against popular 3C+ data pipelines shows advantages of <i>pairtools</i> for high-performance and flexible 3C+ analysis. Finally, <i>pairtools</i> provides protocol-specific tools for restriction-based protocols, haplotype-resolved contacts, and single-cell Hi-C. The combination of CLI tools and tight integration with Python data analysis libraries makes <i>pairtools</i> a versatile foundation for a broad range of 3C+ pipelines.

                <p>by Kerr Ding, Jiaqi Luo, Yunan Luo</p>

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. In those applications, ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) pre-specified by researchers. We propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.

                <p>by Kanyarat Jitmana, Jason I. Griffiths, Sian Fereday, Anna DeFazio, David Bowtell, for Australian Ovarian Cancer Study , Frederick R. Adler</p>

A time-series analysis of serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125)levels was performed in 791 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study to evaluate the development of chemoresistance and response to therapy. To investigate chemoresistance and better predict the treatment effectiveness, we examined two traits: <i>resistance</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were treated with therapy) and <i>aggressiveness</i> (defined as the rate of CA-125 change when patients were not treated). We found that as the number of treatment lines increases, the data-based resistance increases (a decreased rate of CA-125 decay). We use mathematical models of two distinct cancer cell types, treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells, to estimate the values and evolution of the two traits in individual patients. By fitting to individual patient HGSOC data, our models successfully capture the dynamics of the CA-125 level. The parameters estimated from the mathematical models show that patients with inferred low growth rates of treatment-sensitive cells and treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated aggressiveness) and a high death rate of treatment-resistant cells (low model-estimated resistance) have longer survival time after completing their second-line of therapy. These findings show that mathematical models can characterize the degree of <i>resistance</i> and <i>aggressiveness</i> in individual patients, which improves our understanding of chemoresistance development and could predict treatment effectiveness in HGSOC patients.

                <p>by Andriana Manousidaki, Anna Little, Yuying Xie</p>

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution characterization of tissue and cancer compositions. Although numerous tools for dimension reduction and clustering are available for single-cell data analyses, these methods often fail to simultaneously preserve local cluster structure and global data geometry. To address these challenges, we developed a novel analyses framework, Single-Cell Path Metrics Profiling (scPMP), using power-weighted path metrics, which measure distances between cells in a data-driven way. Unlike Euclidean distance and other commonly used distance metrics, path metrics are density sensitive and respect the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which preserves both the global data geometry and cluster structure. We evaluate the method both for clustering quality and geometric fidelity, and it outperforms current scRNAseq clustering algorithms on a wide range of benchmarking data sets.

                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                Background Caring for a child with long-term functional limitations can have a negative impact on the physical and psychological well-being of the caregiver. Family-centered care (FCC) interventions have the potential to empower caregivers and contribute to their well-being. This systematic review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of FCC interventions in improving the well-being of caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP), and identify the key components of such interventions that are most commonly practiced and deemed effective. Methods This review systematically searched seven databases for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of any FCC intervention on the well-being of caregivers of children with or at risk of CP. We used the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool to assess risk of bias and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for critical appraisal. Due to high heterogeneity of studies, narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data. Results The review consists of 11 studies which were categorized into five sections based on the components of FCC intervention provided in each individual study: 1. Information provision, and Enabling and partnership (n= 5); 2. Information provision, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1); 3. Enabling and partnership (n= 2); 4. Enabling and partnership, and Respectful and supportive care (n= 2); 5. Information provision, Enabling and partnership and Respectful and supportive care (n= 1). Risk of bias was low in four studies, unclear in two studies, and high in five studies. Conclusion FCC interventions were found to be effective in improving caregivers’ satisfaction with attainment of child and caregiver goals. Evidence from multiple studies does not strongly support the effectiveness of FCC interventions on caregiver’s mental health, parenting and personal outcomes. Limited evidence precludes a conclusion on the effectiveness of the components of FCC on well-being of caregivers of children with CP.

                Background Mobile elements (MEs) constitute a major portion of the genome in primates and other higher eukaryotes, and they play important role in genome evolution and gene function. MEs can be divided into two fundamentally different classes: DNA transposons which transpose in the genome in a “cut-and-paste” style, and retrotransposons which propagate in a “copy-and-paste” fashion via a process involving transcription and reverse-transcription. In primate genomes, DNA transposons are mostly dead, while many retrotransposons are still highly active. We report here the identification of a unique group of MEs, which we call “retro-DNAs”, for their combined characteristics of these two fundamentally different ME classes. Methods A comparative computational genomic approach was used to analyze the reference genome sequences of 10 primate species consisting of five apes, four monkeys, and marmoset. Results From our analysis, we identified a total of 1,750 retro-DNAs, representing 748 unique insertion events in the genomes of ten primate species including human. These retro-DNAs contain sequences of DNA transposons but lack the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the hallmark of DNA transposons. Instead, they show characteristics of retrotransposons, such as polyA tails, longer target-site duplications (TSDs), and the “TT/AAAA” insertion site motif, suggesting the use of the L1-based target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) mechanism. At least 40% of these retro-DNAs locate into genic regions, presenting potentials for impacting gene function. More interestingly, some retro-DNAs, as well as their parent sites, show certain levels of expression, suggesting that they have the potential to create more retro-DNA copies in the present primate genomes. Conclusions Although small in number, the identification of these retro-DNAs reveals a new mean for propagating DNA transposons in primate genomes without active canonical DNA transposon activity. Our data also suggest that the TPRT machinery may transpose a wider variety of DNA sequences in the genomes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a critical inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a vital role in modulating neuronal excitability. Dysregulation of GABAergic signaling, particularly involving the cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2, has been implicated in various pathologies, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, and ischemia. NKCC1 facilitates chloride influx, whereas KCC2 mediates chloride efflux via potassium gradient. Altered expression and function of these cotransporters have been associated with excitotoxicity, inflammation, and cellular death in ischemic events characterized by reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to compromised tissue metabolism and subsequent cell death. NKCC1 inhibition has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate intracellular chloride accumulation and mitigate neuronal damage during ischemic events. Similarly, targeting KCC2, which regulates chloride efflux, holds promise for improving outcomes and reducing neuronal damage under ischemic conditions. This review emphasizes the critical roles of GABA, NKCC1, and KCC2 in ischemic pathologies and their potential as therapeutic targets. Inhibiting or modulating the activity of these cotransporters represents a promising strategy for reducing neuronal damage, preventing excitotoxicity, and improving neurological outcomes following ischemic events. Furthermore, exploring the interactions between natural compounds and NKCC1/KCC2 provides additional avenues for potential therapeutic interventions for ischemic injury.</p>
