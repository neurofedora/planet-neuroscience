                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Swelling, stiffness, and pain in synovial joints are primary hallmarks of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperactivity of nociceptors and excessive release of inflammatory factors and pain mediators play a crucial role, with emerging data suggesting extensive remodelling and plasticity of joint innervations. Herein, we review structural, functional, and molecular alterations in sensory and autonomic axons wiring arthritic joints and revisit mechanisms implicated in the sensitization of nociceptors, leading to chronic pain. Sprouting and reorganization of sensory and autonomic fibers with the invasion of ectopic branches into surrounding inflamed tissues are associated with the upregulation of pain markers. These changes are frequently complemented by a phenotypic switch of sensory and autonomic profiles and activation of silent axons, inferring homeostatic adjustments and reprogramming of innervations. Identifying critical molecular players and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the rewiring and sensitization of joints is likely to elucidate causatives of neuroinflammation and chronic pain, assisting in finding new therapeutic targets and opportunities for interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09554">Network Dynamics of Emotional Processing: A Structural Balance Theory Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding emotional processing in the human brain requires examining the complex interactions between different brain regions. While previous studies have identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic network approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory to investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks during resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to fear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions would be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to fear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to emotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed participants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in positive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the resting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly decreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward instability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing. Additionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during fear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized network and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's remarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how network stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced triads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex mechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in response to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding emotional resilience and neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09480">The Parameters of Educability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The educability model is a computational model that has been recently proposed to describe the cognitive capability that makes humans unique among existing biological species on Earth in being able to create advanced civilizations. Educability is defined as a capability for acquiring and applying knowledge. It is intended both to describe human capabilities and, equally, as an aspirational description of what can be usefully realized by machines. While the intention is to have a mathematically well-defined computational model, in constructing an instance of the model there are a number of decisions to make. We call these decisions {\it parameters}. In a standard computer, two parameters are the memory capacity and clock rate. There is no universally optimal choice for either one, or even for their ratio. Similarly, in a standard machine learning system, two parameters are the learning algorithm and the dataset used for training. Again, there are no universally optimal choices known for either. An educable system has many more parameters than either of these two kinds of system. This short paper discusses some of the main parameters of educable systems, and the broader implications of their existence.

                arXiv:2406.07445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain continuously process the barrage of sensory inputs they receive from the environment. A wide array of experimental work has shown that the collective activity of neural populations encodes and processes this constant bombardment of information. How these collective patterns of activity depend on single-neuron properties is often unclear. Single-neuron recordings have shown that individual neurons' responses to inputs are nonlinear, which prevents a straightforward extrapolation from single neuron features to emergent collective states. Here, we use a field-theoretic formulation of a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model to study the impact of single-neuron nonlinearities on macroscopic network activity. In this model, a neuron integrates spiking output from other neurons in its membrane voltage and emits spikes stochastically with an intensity depending on the membrane voltage, after which the voltage resets. We show that the interplay between nonlinear spike intensity functions and membrane potential resets can i) give rise to metastable active firing rate states in recurrent networks, and ii) can enhance or suppress mean firing rates and membrane potentials in the same or paradoxically opposite directions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04634">More variable circadian rhythms in epilepsy: a retrospective cross-sectional study using long-term heart rate recordings from wearable sensors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.04634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The circadian rhythm aligns physiology and behaviour with the 24-hour light-dark cycle, and its disruption is linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy. However, how to best quantify circadian disruption remains unclear, as it can manifest across various properties and timescales. A promising but under-explored approach is to assess the intra-individual variability in circadian rhythms over timescales of weeks to years. This is yet to be studied in epilepsy.
  Methods: We retrospectively used wearable smartwatch data (Fitbit) from 143 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 31 controls. For each participant, we extracted the circadian oscillation underlying their heart rate time series and analysed the intra-individual variability of three circadian properties: period, acrophase, and amplitude.
  Findings: We found increased intra-individual variability in period (77 min vs. 62 min, z=3.32, p<0.001) and acrophase (68 min vs. 54 min, z=2.97, p=0.003) for PWE compared to controls, but not in amplitude (1.98 bpm vs. 2.05 bpm, z=-0.66, p=0.51). For PWE, we did not find any correlations between seizure frequency and intra-individual variability in circadian properties, or any difference between weeks with and without seizures.
  Interpretation: This finding indicates that the circadian rhythm of heart rate is more variable for people with epilepsy and that this can be detected using a wearable device. However, we were unable to find any associations with seizure frequency or occurrence, suggesting intra-individual variability could be another manifestation of epilepsy aetiology. Future work should investigate the combined role of anti-seizure medications, demographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviours in driving the increased intra-individual variability of circadian properties in epilepsy.

Abstract: Realistic brain models contain many parameters. Traditionally, gradient-free methods are used for estimating these parameters, but gradient-based methods offer many advantages including scalability. However, brain models are tied to existing brain simulators, which do not support gradient calculation. Here we show how to extend -- within the public interface of such simulators -- these neural models to also compute the gradients with respect to their parameters. We demonstrate that the computed gradients can be used to optimize a biophysically realistic multicompartmental neuron model with the gradient-based Adam optimizer. Beyond tuning, gradient-based optimization could lead the way towards dynamics learning and homeostatic control within simulations.

                arXiv:2412.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating "spatial" latents such as object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.

                arXiv:2412.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The olfactory system employs responses of an ensemble of odorant receptors (ORs) to sense molecules and to generate olfactory percepts. Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), widely regarded as the fundamental goal of artificial intelligence, represents the realization of cognitive capabilities that enable the handling of general tasks with human-like proficiency. Researchers in brain-inspired AI seek inspiration from the operational mechanisms of the human brain, aiming to replicate its functional rules in intelligent models. Moreover, with the rapid development of large-scale models in recent years, the concept of agents has garnered increasing attention, with researchers widely recognizing it as a necessary pathway toward achieving AGI. In this article, we propose the concept of a brain-inspired AI agent and analyze how to extract relatively feasible and agent-compatible cortical region functionalities and their associated functional connectivity networks from the complex mechanisms of the human brain. Implementing these structures within an agent enables it to achieve basic cognitive intelligence akin to human capabilities. Finally, we explore the limitations and challenges for realizing brain-inspired agents and discuss their future development.

                arXiv:2412.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.

                arXiv:2412.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic applications emulate the processing performed by the brain by using spikes as inputs instead of time-varying analog stimuli. Therefore, these time-varying stimuli have to be encoded into spikes, which can induce important information loss. To alleviate this loss, some studies use population coding strategies to encode more information using a population of neurons rather than just one neuron. However, configuring the encoding parameters of such a population is an open research question. This work proposes an approach based on maximizing the mutual information between the signal and the spikes in the population of neurons. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition. Two applications are presented: blood pressure pulse wave classification, and neural action potential waveform classification. In both tasks, the data is encoded into spikes and the encoding parameters of the neuron populations are tuned to maximize the encoded information using the proposed algorithm. The spikes are then classified and the performance is measured using classification accuracy as a metric. Two key results are reported. Firstly, adding neurons to the population leads to an increase in both mutual information and classification accuracy beyond what could be accounted for by each neuron separately, showing the usefulness of population coding strategies. Secondly, the classification accuracy obtained with the tuned parameters is near-optimal and it closely follows the mutual information as more neurons are added to the population. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly outperforms random parameter selection, showing the usefulness of the proposed approach. These results are reproduced in both applications.

                arXiv:2412.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) simulates complex interactions between the coupled Earth and human systems, providing valuable insights into the co-evolution of land, water, and energy sectors under different future scenarios. Understanding the sensitivities and drivers of this multisectoral system can lead to more robust understanding of the different pathways to particular outcomes. The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth systems make GCAM simulations costly to run at scale - a requirement for large ensemble experiments which explore uncertainty in model parameters and outputs. A differentiable emulator with similar predictive power, but greater efficiency, could provide novel scenario discovery and analysis of GCAM and its outputs, requiring fewer runs of GCAM. As a first use case, we train a neural network on an existing large ensemble that explores a range of GCAM inputs related to different relative contributions of energy production sources, with a focus on wind and solar. We complement this existing ensemble with interpolated input values and a wider selection of outputs, predicting 22,528 GCAM outputs across time, sectors, and regions. We report a median $R^2$ score of 0.998 for the emulator's predictions and an $R^2$ score of 0.812 for its input-output sensitivity.

Abstract: This article presents a comparative analysis of GPU-parallelized implementations of the quantum-inspired evolutionary optimization (QIEO) approach and one of the well-known classical metaheuristic techniques, the genetic algorithm (GA). The study assesses the performance of both algorithms on highly non-linear, non-convex, and non-separable function optimization problems, viz., Ackley, Rosenbrock, and Rastrigin, that are representative of the complex real-world optimization problems. The performance of these algorithms is checked by varying the population sizes by keeping all other parameters constant and comparing the fitness value it reached along with the number of function evaluations they required for convergence. The results demonstrate that QIEO performs better for these functions than GA, by achieving the target fitness with fewer function evaluations and significantly reducing the total optimization time approximately three times for the Ackley function and four times for the Rosenbrock and Rastrigin functions. Furthermore, QIEO exhibits greater consistency across trials, with a steady convergence rate that leads to a more uniform number of function evaluations, highlighting its reliability in solving challenging optimization problems. The findings indicate that QIEO is a promising alternative to GA for these kind of functions.

                arXiv:2410.14031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.

                arXiv:2412.05305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are pivotal in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often exhibit inherent limitations and biases, preventing the development of a universal solution applicable to diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce a robust clustering framework that integrates the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. The framework begins with an ensemble clustering approach to generate an initial clustering solution, which is then refined using MDL-guided evaluation functions and optimized through a genetic algorithm. This integration allows the method to adapt to the dataset's intrinsic properties, minimizing dependency on the initial clustering input and ensuring a data-driven, robust clustering process. We evaluated the proposed method on thirteen benchmark datasets using four established validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional clustering methods, yielding higher accuracy, improved stability, and reduced bias. The methods adaptability makes it effective across datasets with diverse characteristics, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable tool for complex clustering tasks. By combining the MDL principle with genetic optimization, this study offers a significant advancement in clustering methodology, addressing key limitations and delivering superior performance in varied applications.

	<p>Background/Objectives: To examine the relationships between state affect and sleep health at within- and between-person levels among health science students. Methods: A correlational design was used and 54 health science students were included. The participants completed baseline and 7-day ambulatory assessments in a free-living setting. Daily sleep and affect were measured using the Consensus Sleep Diary and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the effects of affect on sleep health. Results: The participants were 19.8 (SD, 0.6) years and 92.6% were females. Approximately 40% had poor sleep quality. Controlling for the potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, and bedtime procrastination), higher within-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, and less feeling rested. Higher between-person negative affect predicted shorter sleep duration. Higher within-person positive affect predicted longer sleep onset latency. Higher within- and between-person positive affect predicted more feeling rested. Conclusions: Negative affect was most consistently associated with sleep health at the individual level. Affect regulation should be considered when delivering personalized interventions targeting sleep health among health science students.</p>

                <p>Although most adults in the United States will drink alcohol in their life, only ~6% will go on to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). While a great deal of work has furthered our understanding of the cycle of addiction, it remains unclear why certain people transition to disordered drinking. Altered activity in regions implicated in AUDs, like the basolateral amygdala (BLA), has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of AUDs, but how these networks contribute to alcohol misuse remains unclear. Here we investigated how the impact of alcohol on the BLA network relates to alcohol exposure. We first examined the effect of acute ethanol administration on the BLA and frontal cortical networks and the relationship with subsequent voluntary ethanol consumption using the Intermittent Access paradigm. In addition, we recorded network activity from the BLA and frontal cortex throughout the Drinking-in-the-Dark-Multiple Scheduled Access paradigm to assess the impact of voluntary alcohol consumption on network states during binge and abstinence periods. Finally, we investigated the impact of acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure on BLA and frontal cortex network states using the Chronic Intermittent Ethanol (vapor) paradigm. We demonstrate that across paradigms, ethanol alters low gamma band (40&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and remarkably correlates with the extent of future voluntary ethanol consumption in the IA paradigm. These data suggest that BLA network states play a role in the mechanisms influencing voluntary alcohol intake.</p>

                <p>Maintaining concentration on demanding cognitive tasks, such as vigilance (VG) and working memory (WM) tasks, is crucial for successful task completion. Previous research suggests that internal concentration maintenance fluctuates, potentially declining to suboptimal states, which can influence trial-by-trial performance in these tasks. However, the timescale of such alertness maintenance, as indicated by slow changes in pupil diameter, has not been thoroughly investigated. This study explored whether "pupil trends"&mdash;which selectively signal suboptimal tonic alertness maintenance at various timescales&mdash;negatively correlate with trial-by-trial performance in VG and WM tasks. Using the psychomotor vigilance task (VG) and the visual&ndash;spatial two-back task (WM), we found that human pupil trends lasting over 10&nbsp;s were significantly higher in trials with longer reaction times, indicating poorer performance, compared with shorter reaction time trials, which indicated better performance. The attention network test further validated that these slow trends reflect suboptimal states related to (tonic) alertness maintenance rather than suboptimal performance specific to VG and WM tasks, which is more associated with (phasic) responses to instantaneous interference. These findings highlight the potential role of detecting and compensating for nonoptimal states in VG and WM performance, significantly beyond the 10&nbsp;s timescale. Additionally, the findings suggest the possibility of estimating human concentration during various visual tasks, even when rapid pupil changes occur due to luminance fluctuations.</p>

                Introduction Spontaneous tendon ruptures in end stage kidney disease patients have the potential to cause long- term morbidity, and timely intervention is required to prevent complications that can severely affect the functional status of the patient. Case presentation A series of six tendons (two triceps tendons and two bilateral patellar tendons) in three patients with ESKD undergoing hemodialysis is discussed in this case series. Patients were aged 61, 44 and 26 years, and on hemodialysis for 5, 10 and 5 years, respectively. Conclusion End -stage kidney disease is associated with a multitude of physiological changes, and the musculoskeletal system is no exception to this. Spontaneous tendon rupture is a multifactorial complication of ESKD, with serious implications for mobility and quality of life. As a result, these patients require a multifaceted approach to ensure optimum results and an early return to activity. We report a series of 6 spontaneous tendon ruptures in 3 patients with ESKD at our institution. We would like to outline the methods of repair for each case and further attempt to assess biochemical parameters that may have contributed to the disease process.

                <p>by Yutong Sun, Peng Qiu</p>

When analyzing scRNA-seq data containing heterogeneous cell populations, an important task is to select informative marker genes to distinguish various cell clusters and annotate the clusters with biologically meaningful cell types. In existing analysis methods and pipelines, marker genes are typically identified using a one-vs-all strategy, examining differential expression between one cell cluster versus the combination of all other cell clusters. However, this strategy applied to cell clusters belonging to closely related cell types often generates overlapping marker genes, which capture the common signature of closely related cell clusters but provide limited information for distinguishing them. To address the limitations of the one-vs-all strategy, we propose a hierarchical marker gene selection strategy that groups similar cell clusters and selects marker genes in a hierarchical manner. This strategy is able to improve the accuracy and interpretability of cell type identification in single-cell RNA-seq data.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene (isoform 2, 3, or 4). The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein. We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology.

The local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of the extracellular potential, reflects transmembrane currents in the vicinity of the recording electrode. Thought mainly to stem from currents caused by synaptic input, it provides information about neural activity complementary to that of spikes, the output of neurons. However, the many neural sources contributing to the LFP, and likewise the derived current source density (CSD), can often make it challenging to interpret. Efforts to improve its interpretability have included the application of statistical decomposition tools like principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to disentangle the contributions from different neural sources. However, their underlying assumptions of, respectively, orthogonality and statistical independence are not always valid for the various processes or pathways generating LFP. Here, we expand upon and validate a decomposition algorithm named Laminar Population Analysis (LPA), which is based on physiological rather than statistical assumptions. LPA utilizes the multiunit activity (MUA) and LFP jointly to uncover the contributions of different populations to the LFP. To perform the validation of LPA, we used data simulated with the large-scale, biophysically detailed model of mouse V1 developed by the Allen Institute. We find that LPA can identify laminar positions within V1 and the temporal profiles of laminar population firing rates from the MUA. We also find that LPA can estimate the salient current sinks and sources generated by feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), recurrent activity in V1, and feedback input from the lateromedial (LM) area of visual cortex. LPA identifies and distinguishes these contributions with a greater accuracy than the alternative statistical decomposition methods, PCA and ICA. The contributions from different cortical layers within V1 could however not be robustly separated and identified with LPA. This is likely due to substantial synchrony in population firing rates across layers, which may be reduced with other stimulus protocols in the future. Lastly, we also demonstrate the application of LPA on experimentally recorded MUA and LFP from 24 animals in the publicly available Visual Coding dataset. Our results suggest that LPA can be used both as a method to estimate positions of laminar populations and to uncover salient features in LFP/CSD contributions from different populations.

The interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in tumour progression. While the extracellular degradation of ECM proteins has been well characterised, ECM endocytosis and its impact on cancer cell progression, migration, and metastasis is poorly understood. ECM internalisation is increased in invasive breast cancer cells, suggesting it may support invasiveness. However, current high-throughput approaches mainly focus on cells grown on plastic in 2D, making it difficult to apply these to the study of ECM dynamics. Here, we developed a high-content screening assay to study ECM uptake, based on the of use automated ECM coating for the generation of highly homogeneous ECM a pH-sensitive dye to image ECM trafficking in live cells. We identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, MAP3K1 and MAPK11 (p38β), and the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) subunit PPP2R1A were required for the internalisation of ECM-bound α2β1 integrin. Mechanistically, we show that down-regulation of the sodium/proton exchanger 1 (NHE1), an established macropinocytosis regulator and a target of p38, mediated ECM macropinocytosis. Moreover, disruption of α2 integrin, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and NHE1-mediated ECM internalisation significantly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion in 2D and 3D culture systems. Of note, integrin-bound ECM was targeted for lysosomal degradation, which was required for cell migration on cell-derived matrices. Finally, α2β1 integrin and MAP3K1 expression were significantly up-regulated in pancreatic tumours and correlated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Strikingly, MAP3K1, MAPK11, PPP2R1A, and α2 integrin expression were higher in chemotherapy-resistant tumours in breast cancer patients. Our results identified the α2β1 integrin/p38 signalling axis as a novel regulator of ECM endocytosis, which drives invasive migration and tumour progression, demonstrating that our high-content screening approach has the capability of identifying novel regulators of cancer cell invasion.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>When I began my career, I had no idea that much of it would center around the hippocampus. Here I discuss some of the history of how this happened. I briefly mention my early undergraduate life and the problems it posed for getting into graduate school. I describe the unique circumstances that led me to Allan Wagner's laboratory and changed my career trajectory. My path to the hippocampus began with a decision to study memory development. This led to a collaboration with Rob Sutherland that produced the configural theory of the hippocampus. The idea was that the hippocampus facilitated the construction of representations of the co-occurring stimulus elements currently experienced by the organism. Thus, if two elements, A and B, occurred together, a representation, AB, could be constructed that could be discriminated from its elements, A and B. This idea was partially correct, but we missed an important property of the hippocampal system that was recognized by O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 that is, that the hippocampus is an unmotivated, rapid learning system. Randy O'Reilly and I addressed this issue in what we called conjunctive representation theory and put forth a detailed cortical-hippocampus computational theory to explain how this could work I later realized that our ideas were remarkably like Tim Teyler's indexing theory of how the hippocampal system supports memory. At a Park City meeting, a chance encounter with Tim (whom I had never met) resulted in the opportunity to write a paper with Tim updating the indexing theory, It is my favorite theoretical paper.</p>

                The lateral thalamus (LT) receives input from primary sensory nuclei and responds to multimodal stimuli. The LT is also involved in regulating innate and social behaviors through its projections to cortical and limbic networks. However, the importance of multisensory processing within the LT in modulating behavioral output has not been explicitly addressed. Here, we discuss recent findings primarily from rodent studies that extend the classical view of the LT as a passive relay, by underscoring its involvement in associating multimodal features and encoding the salience, valence, and social relevance of sensory signals. We propose that the primary function of the LT is to integrate sensory and non-sensory aspects of multisensory input to gate naturalistic behaviors.

                Across studied vertebrates, the medial amygdala (MeA) is a central hub for relaying sensory information with social and/or survival relevance to downstream nuclei such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and the hypothalamus. MeA-driven behaviors, such as mating, aggression, parenting, and predator avoidance are processed by different molecularly defined inhibitory and excitatory neuronal output populations. Work over the past two decades has deciphered how diverse MeA neurons arise from embryonic development, revealing contributions from multiple telencephalic and diencephalic progenitor domains. Here, we first provide a brief overview of current findings regarding the role of the MeA in social behaviors, followed by a deeper dive into current knowledge of how this complex structure is specified during development. We outline a conceptual model of MeA formation that has emerged based on these findings. We further postulate how embryonic developmental programming of the MeA may inform later emergence of stereotypical circuitry governing hardwired behaviors.

                In this paper, Lin et al. establish design principles for therapeutic Hsp104 variants. By leveraging high-resolution structures of the Hsp104 disaggregase, they rationally engineer enhanced disaggregases with retuned Hsp70 collaboration and minimal off-target unfoldase activity. These safely enhanced Hsp104 variants effectively mitigate FUS and TDP-43 proteinopathies in human cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98277">Marcks and Marcks-like 1 proteins promote spinal cord development and regeneration in Xenopus</a></h4>

              
                Marcks and Marcksl1 are abundant proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and membrane to modulate multiple cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, proliferation, and secretion. Here, we performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> to reveal the novel roles of these proteins in spinal cord development and regeneration. We show that Marcks and Marcksl1 have partly redundant functions and are required for normal neurite formation and proliferation of neuro-glial progenitors during embryonic spinal cord development and for its regeneration during tadpole stages. Rescue experiments in Marcks and Marcksl1 loss-of-function animals further suggested that some of the functions of Marcks and Marcksl1 in the spinal cord are mediated by phospholipid signaling. Taken together, these findings identify Marcks and Marcksl1 as critical new players in spinal cord development and regeneration and suggest new pathways to be targeted for therapeutic stimulation of spinal cord regeneration in human patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96338">A systematic review and meta-analysis of eyespot anti-predator mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Eyespot patterns have evolved in many prey species. These patterns were traditionally explained by the eye mimicry hypothesis, which proposes that eyespots resembling vertebrate eyes function as predator avoidance. However, it is possible that eyespots do not mimic eyes: according to the conspicuousness hypothesis, eyespots are just one form of vivid signals where only conspicuousness matters. They might work simply through neophobia or unfamiliarity, without necessarily implying aposematism or the unprofitability to potential predators. To test these hypotheses and explore factors influencing predators’ responses, we conducted a meta-analysis with 33 empirical papers that focused on bird responses to both real lepidopterans and artificial targets with conspicuous patterns (i.e. eyespots and non-eyespots). Supporting the latter hypothesis, the results showed no clear difference in predator avoidance efficacy between eyespots and non-eyespots. When comparing geometric pattern characteristics, bigger pattern sizes and smaller numbers of patterns were more effective in preventing avian predation. This finding indicates that single concentric patterns have stronger deterring effects than paired ones. Taken together, our study supports the conspicuousness hypothesis more than the eye mimicry hypothesis. Due to the number and species coverage of published studies so far, the generalisability of our conclusion may be limited. The findings highlight that pattern conspicuousness is key to eliciting avian avoidance responses, shedding a different light on this classic example of signal evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92091">A multiplexed, single-cell sequencing screen identifies compounds that increase neurogenic reprogramming of murine Muller glia</a></h4>

              
                Retinal degeneration in mammals causes permanent loss of vision, due to an inability to regenerate naturally. Some non-mammalian vertebrates show robust regeneration, via Muller glia (MG). We have recently made significant progress in stimulating adult mouse MG to regenerate functional neurons by transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1. While these results showed that MG can serve as an endogenous source of neuronal replacement, the efficacy of this process is limited. With the goal of improving this in mammals, we designed a small molecule screen using sci-Plex, a method to multiplex up to thousands of single-nucleus RNA-seq conditions into a single experiment. We used this technology to screen a library of 92 compounds, identified, and validated two that promote neurogenesis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling can substantially improve the discovery process for molecules and pathways that can stimulate neural regeneration and further demonstrate the potential for this approach to restore vision in patients with retinal disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97552">The evolutionary history of the ancient weevil family Belidae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) reveals the marks of Gondwana breakup and major floristic turnovers, including the rise of angiosperms</a></h4>

              
                The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and palaeogeographical events, we integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 Ma ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana’s breakup, surviving on distant, disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera <i>Rhinotia</i> (Australian region) and <i>Proterhinus</i> (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.

The resulting framework, when combined with an efficient method for factorizing high-dimensional vectors, can represent and operate on numerical values over a large dynamic range using resources that scale only logarithmically with the range, a vast improvement over previous methods. It also exhibits impressive robustness to noise. We demonstrate the potential for this framework to solve computationally difficult problems in visual perception and combinatorial optimization, showing improvement over baseline methods. More broadly, the framework provides a possible account for the computational operations of grid cells in the brain, and it suggests new machine learning architectures for representing and manipulating numerical data.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In this study, we investigate the quantification of the statistical reliability of detected change points (CPs) in time series using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Thanks to its flexibility, RNN holds the potential to effectively identify CPs in time series characterized by complex dynamics. However, there is an increased risk of erroneously detecting random noise fluctuations as CPs. The primary goal of this study is to rigorously control the risk of false detections by providing theoretically valid p-values to the CPs detected by RNN. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method based on the framework of selective inference (SI). SI enables valid inferences by conditioning on the event of hypothesis selection, thus mitigating bias from generating and testing hypotheses on the same data. In this study, we apply an SI framework to RNN-based CP detection, where characterizing the complex process of RNN selecting CPs is our main technical challenge. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method through artificial and real data experiments.</span>

Here, we consider a decision-theoretic approach to study networks of bounded rational decision makers that are allowed to specialize and communicate with each other. In contrast to previous work that has focused on feedforward communication between decision-making agents, we consider cyclical information processing paths allowing for back-and-forth communication. We adapt message-passing algorithms to suit this purpose, essentially allowing for local information flow between units and thus enabling circular dependency structures. We provide examples that show how repeated communication can increase performance given that each unit’s information processing capability is limited and that decision-making systems with too few or too many connections and feedback loops achieve suboptimal utility.</span>

Modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods perform a similar operation but in terms of scalar rewards. Despite this similarity, the relationship between action updates of deep RL and human error–based learning has yet to be investigated. Here, we systematically compare the three major families of deep RL algorithms to human error–based learning. We show that all three deep RL approaches are qualitatively different from human error–based learning, as assessed by a mirror-reversal perturbation experiment. To bridge this gap, we developed an alternative deep RL algorithm inspired by human error–based learning, model-based deterministic policy gradients (MB-DPG). We showed that MB-DPG captures human error–based learning under mirror-reversal and rotational perturbations and that MB-DPG learns faster than canonical model-free algorithms on complex arm-based reaching tasks, while being more robust to (forward) model misspecification than model-based RL.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Even as machine learning exceeds human-level performance on many applications, the generality, robustness, and rapidity of the brain’s learning capabilities remain unmatched. How cognition arises from neural activity is <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> central open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of intelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in Papadimitriou et al. (<a href="#bib37" class="reflinks">2020</a>) and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical proofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive operations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However, many intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and manipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to list a few). Here we show that in the same model, sequential precedence can be captured naturally through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a result, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out. In particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to the memorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: upon future presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assembly and its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the end of the sequence. If the stimulus sequence is presented to two brain areas simultaneously, a scaffolded representation is created, resulting in more efficient memorization and recall, in agreement with cognitive experiments. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learned in a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns of sequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be capable of universal computation. Taken together, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the brain’s remarkable abilities to compute and learn, with sequences playing a vital role.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The free energy principle (FEP) describes (biological) agents as minimizing a variational free energy (FE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. Active inference (AIF) is a corollary of the FEP that describes how agents explore and exploit their environment by minimizing an expected FE objective. In two related papers, we describe a scalable, epistemic approach to synthetic AIF by message passing on free-form Forney-style factor graphs (FFGs). A companion paper (part I of this article; Koudahl et al., <a href="#bib18" class="reflinks">2023</a>) introduces a constrained FFG (CFFG) notation that visually represents (generalized) FE objectives for AIF. This article (part II) derives message-passing algorithms that minimize (generalized) FE objectives on a CFFG by variational calculus. A comparison between simulated Bethe and generalized FE agents illustrates how the message-passing approach to synthetic AIF induces epistemic behavior on a T-maze navigation task. Extension of the T-maze simulation to learning goal statistics and a multiagent bargaining setting illustrate how this approach encourages reuse of nodes and updates in alternative settings. With a full message-passing account of synthetic AIF agents, it becomes possible to derive and reuse message updates across models and move closer to industrial applications of synthetic AIF.</span>

">What are you talking about? Representation of the Topic of Speech in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                A sentence outside the context provides very restricted information to the listener. Real understanding requires one to be able to place it within the sequence of sentences forming a coherent story and just as importantly, within ones general knowledge of the topic. Here, we demonstrate the existence of functional brain networks that are robustly sensitive to the topic of ca. 6-minute-long coherent newspaper articles. The main network hubs are located in the parietal and temporal brain regions. These networks changed very slowly during the course of the article, consistent with their involvement in representing the topic rather than the story aspect of the context. Because even the meaning of words can depend on the topic (see, e.g., the word shuttle in transportation and weaving), the topic-sensitive network must also be intimately linked with the mental lexicon underlying language comprehension.

">Selective Targeting of a Defined Subpopulation of Corticospinal Neurons using a Novel Klhl14-Cre Mouse Line Enables Molecular and Anatomical Investigations through Development into Maturity</a></h4>

              
                The corticospinal tract (CST) facilitates skilled, precise movements, which necessitates that subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) establish segmentally specific connectivity with brainstem and spinal circuits. Developmental molecular delineation enables prospective identification of corticospinal neurons (CSN) projecting to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments; however, it remains unclear whether other SCPN subpopulations in developing sensorimotor cortex can be prospectively identified in this manner. Such molecular tools could enable investigations of SCPN circuitry with precision and specificity. During development, Kelch-like 14 (Klhl14) is specifically expressed by a specific SCPN subpopulation, CSNBC-lat, that reside in lateral sensorimotor cortex with axonal projections exclusively to bulbar-cervical targets. In this study, we generated Klhl14-T2A-Cre knock-in mice to investigate SCPN that are Klhl14+ during development into maturity. Using conditional anterograde and retrograde labeling, we find that Klhl14-Cre is specifically expressed by CSNBC-lat only at specific developmental time points. We establish conditional viral labeling in Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice as a new approach to reliably investigate CSNBC-lat axon targeting and confirm that this identifies known molecular regulators of CSN axon targeting. Therefore, Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice can be used as a novel tool for identifying molecular regulators of CST axon guidance in a relatively high-throughput manner in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that intersectional viral labeling enables precise targeting of only Klhl14-Cre+ CSNBC-lat in the adult central nervous system. Together, our results establish that developmental molecular delineation of SCPN subpopulations can be used to selectively and specifically investigate their development, as well as anatomical and functional organization into maturity.

">Age-related decline in neural phase-locking to envelope and temporal fine structure revealed by frequency following responses: A potential signature of cochlear synaptopathy impairing speech intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                Assessing the contribution of cochlear synaptopathy (CS) to the variability in speech-in-noise intelligibility among individuals remains a challenge. While several studies have proposed biomarkers for CS based on neural phase-locking to the temporal envelope (ENV), fewer have investigated how CS affects the coding of temporal fine structure (TFS), despite its crucial role in speech-in-noise perception. In this study, we specifically examined whether TFS-based markers of CS could be derived from electrophysiological responses and psychophysical detection thresholds of spectral modulation (SM) in a complex tone, which serves as a parametric model of speech. We employed an integrated approach, combining psychophysical testing with frequency-following response (FFR) measurements in three groups of participants: young normal-hearing (yNH), older normal-hearing (oNH), and older hearing-impaired (oHI) individuals. We expanded on previous work by assessing phase-locking to both ENV, using a 4 kHz rectangular amplitude-modulated (RAM) tone, and TFS, using a low-frequency (<1.5 kHz) SM complex tone. Overall, FFR results showed significant reductions in neural phase-locking to both ENV and TFS components with age and hearing loss. Specifically, the strength of TFS-related FFRs, particularly the component corresponding to the harmonic closest to the peak of the spectral envelope (~500 Hz), was negatively correlated with age, even after adjusting for audiometric thresholds. This TFS marker also correlated with ENV-related FFRs derived from the RAM tone, suggesting a shared decline in phase-locking capacity across low and high cochlear frequencies. Computational simulations of the auditory periphery indicated that the observed FFR strength reduction with age is consistent with approximately 50% loss of auditory nerve fibers, aligning with histopathological data. However, the TFS-based FFR marker did not account for variability in speech intelligibility observed in the same participants. Psychophysical measurements showed no age-related effects and were unrelated to the TFS-based FFR marker, highlighting the need for further psychophysical research to establish a behavioral counterpart. Altogether, our results demonstrate that FFRs to vowel-like stimuli can serve as a complementary electrophysiological marker for assessing neural coding fidelity to stimulus TFS. This approach could provide a valuable tool for better understanding the impact of CS on an important coding dimension for speech-in-noise perception.

">Sneezing in response to bright light exposure: A case study in a photic sneezer</a></h4>

              
                Background: The photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is a widespread, yet understudied phenomenon characterised by sneezing in response to bright-light exposure, reportedly affecting around 30% of the general population. Our goals were to collect real-world data to characterise PSR-inducing naturalistic light conditions, and to develop an indoor protocol to reliably induce the PSR in affected subjects using parametric stimuli. Methods: This study was carried out on one male adult affected by photic sneezing (n=1). To characterise naturalistic light conditions eliciting photic sneezing, real-world light exposure was measured over a 30-day period, while logging PSR events. To study photic sneezing in response to artificial stimuli, a setup including a multi-primary LED source and an integrating sphere was used to present 30-second light stimuli to the subject while collecting pupillometric data with an eye-tracker. Results: 82 photic sneeze events were recorded, with an average of 2.73 sneezes per day and a range of 1 to 6 sneezes per event. At a sneeze event, illuminance is on average ten times bigger than five minutes before the sneeze event. A significant increase in illuminance is observed around 2 minutes before the sneeze event. Light levels go back down to pre-sneeze levels within 10 minutes after sneezing. Despite exposure to more than 150 stimuli, no sneeze could be artificially induced in the subject. However, a strong tickling sensation was consistently reported, especially for high illuminance settings. Conclusions: Real-world light data confirmed that a sudden increase in environmental lighting conditions can induce photic sneezing. Further analysis could be relevant on instances of illuminance increments not eliciting a photic sneeze. The experimental setup only elicited tickling sensations, but with further testing and optimisation, it is reasonable to assume that it would reliably induce photic sneezes, thereby opening further mechanistic study of this intriguing phenomenon.

                The genus Peromyscus has been extensively used as a model for ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary investigations. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), craniofacial morphology, and pinna measurements to compare characteristics that impact hearing in two wild-caught species, P. leucopus P. maniculatus. We observed significant statistical differences in craniofacial and pinna attributes between species with P. leucopus overall exhibiting larger features than P. maniculatus. ABR recordings indicated that both species showed similar best frequency thresholds between 8-24 kHz. We found significant effects of intensity on amplitude ratio of wave I and IV for P. maniculatus, but not P. leucopus and effects of wave number on slope of the latency-intensity function with higher wave IV and shorter wave I slope of latency intensity function in P. leucopus. Finally, the data showed significant differences in latency shift of the DN1 component of the BIC in relation to ITD between species, while no significant differences were observed across relative DN1 amplitude. This study supports the used of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus as future model species for auditory research.

">Exercise-induced differential transcriptional output of AMPK signalling improves axon regeneration and functional recovery</a></h4>

              
                In adulthood, the regenerative capacity of the injured brain circuit is poor preventing functional restoration. Rehabilitative physical exercise is a promising approach to overcome such functional impairment and the metabolic sensor AMPK has emerged to be a critical mediator for this. However, the mechanistic understanding of upstream and downstream components of AMPK signalling in the physical exercise-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration is not clear. We combined swimming exercise with laser axotomy of posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans to address this question. We found that direct activation of AMPK through AICAR treatment is sufficient to improve axon regeneration and functional recovery. The PAR-4/Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) acts upstream of AMPK to enhance functional recovery following swimming exercise. Using genetics, tissue-specific RNAi, and AICAR treatment, we found that the transcriptional regulators DAF-16 and MDT-15 act downstream of AMPK in mediating the positive effects of swimming. We found that MDT-15 acts in neuron to mediate the benefit of AMPK activation in axon regeneration, whereas DAF-16 acts both in neuron and muscle to promote regrowth downstream to AMPK. We also showed that swimming exercise induces nuclear localization of DAF-16 in an AMPK-dependent manner. Our results showed that neuronal and non-neuronal arms of AMPK signalling play an integrative role in response to physical exercise to promote functional recovery after axon injury.

">Cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in category-selectivity in visual cortex following pediatric cortical resection</a></h4>

              
                The topographic organization of category-selective responses in human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) and its relationship to regions subserving language functions is remarkably uniform across individuals. This arrangement is thought to result from the clustering of neurons responding to similar inputs, constrained by intrinsic architecture and tuned by experience. We examined the malleability of this organization in individuals with unilateral resection of VOTC during childhood for the management of drug-resistant epilepsy. In cross-sectional and longitudinal functional imaging studies, we compared the topography and neural representations of 17 category-selective regions in individuals with a VOTC resection, a 'control patient' with resection outside VOTC, and typically developing matched controls. We demonstrated both adherence to and deviation from the standard topography and uncovered fine-grained competitive dynamics between word- and face-selectivity over time in the single, preserved VOTC. The findings elucidate the nature and extent of cortical plasticity and highlight the potential for remodeling of extrastriate architecture and function.

">Development of a real-time neural controller using an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model</a></h4>

              
                Here we present our development of a novel real-time neural controller based on an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model, designed for volitional control of robots and computers. Our controller uniquely enables motion control during both isometric and non-isometric muscle contractions. We address several key challenges in EMG control system design, including accuracy, latency, and robustness. Our approach combines EMG signal processing, neural activation dynamics, and Hill-type muscle modeling to translate neural commands into muscle forces, which can enhance robustness against electrode variability and signal noise. Additionally, we integrate muscle activation dynamics with impedance control, inspired by the human motor control system, for smooth and adaptive interactions. As an initial proof of concept, we demonstrated that our system could control a robot actuator across a range of movements, both static and dynamic, and at different operating speeds, achieving high reference tracking performance and state-of-the-art processing times of 2.9 ms, important for real-time embedded computing. This research helps lay the groundwork for next-generation neural-machine interfaces that are fast, accurate, and adaptable to diverse users and control applications.

">Hypocretin receptor 1 blockade early in abstinence reduces future demand for cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Relapse to cocaine use after abstinence remains a significant challenge for treating cocaine use disorder. While the mechanisms of relapse are still under investigation, adaptations in mesolimbic dopamine systems may contribute to cocaine craving and propensity for relapse. Current pharmacological treatments targeting dopamine systems are often intolerable and may have abuse potential. Therefore, identifying novel pharmacological targets for cocaine use disorder is crucial. The hypocretin/orexin system has been shown to regulate cocaine-associated behavior and dopamine transmission. Our previous studies indicated that the hypocretin receptor 1 antagonist, RTIOX-276, reduced motivation for cocaine and attenuated dopamine responses to cocaine. Importantly, the effects of RTIOX-276 on dopamine transmission persisted for at least 24 hours, suggesting lasting effects of hypocretin receptor antagonism. Here, we hypothesized that a single RTIOX-276 treatment would reduce motivation for cocaine and normalize dopamine transmission after abstinence. Rats were pre-assessed for cocaine consumption and motivation using a within-session threshold schedule before intermittent access exposure to cocaine. Rats were subsequently treated with RTIOX-276 on the first day of a 7-day abstinence period, after which they were reassessed for cocaine consumption and motivation or examined for dopamine transmission using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in nucleus accumbens core slices. We found that a single treatment with RTIOX-276 on the first day of abstinence reduced motivation for cocaine and normalized aberrant dopamine uptake observed following intermittent access to cocaine. These findings suggest that hypocretin receptor 1 may be a viable target for reducing motivation for cocaine through alterations in dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens.

">Multimodal single-cell analyses reveal molecular markers of neuronal senescence in human drug-resistant epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The histopathological neurons in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy exhibit aberrant cytoarchitecture and imbalanced synaptic circuit function. However, the gene expression changes of these neurons remain unknown, making it difficult for the diagnosis or to dissect the mechanism of drug-resistant epilepsy. By integrating whole-cell patch clamp recording and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches, we identified a transcriptionally distinct subset of cortical pyramidal neurons. These neurons highly expressed genes CDKN1A (P21), CCL2 and NFKBIA that associated with mTOR pathway, inflammatory response and cellular senescence. We confirmed the expression of senescent marker genes in a subpopulation of cortical pyramidal neurons with enlarged soma size in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy. We further revealed the expression of senescent cell markers P21, P53, COX2, {gamma}-H2AX, {beta}-Gal and reduction of nuclear integrity marker Lamin B1 in histopathological neurons in the brain tissue of drug-resistant epilepsy patients with different pathologies, but not in control brain tissue with no history of epilepsy. Additionally, chronic, but not acute, epileptic seizures induced senescent markers expression in cortical neurons in mouse models of drug-resistant epilepsy. These results provide important molecular markers for histopathological neurons and new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of drug-resistant epilepsy.

">Behavioral and genetic markers of susceptibility to escalate fentanyl intake.</a></h4>

              
                Background: The ''loss of control'' over drug consumption, present in opioid use disorder (OUD) and known as escalation of intake, is well-established in preclinical rodent models. However, little is known about how antecedent behavioral characteristics, such as valuation of hedonic reinforcers prior to drug use, may impact the trajectory of fentanyl intake over time. Moreover, it is unclear if distinct escalation phenotypes may be driven by genetic markers predictive of OUD susceptibility. Methods: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=63) were trained in a sucrose reinforcement task using a progressive ratio schedule. Individual differences in responsivity to sucrose were hypothesized to predict escalation of fentanyl intake. Rats underwent daily 1-h acquisition sessions for i.v. fentanyl self-administration (2.5  g/kg; FR1) for 7 days, followed by 21 6-h escalation sessions, then tissue from prefrontal cortex was collected for RNA sequencing and qPCR. Latent growth curve and group-based trajectory modeling were used, respectively, to evaluate the association between sucrose reinforcement and fentanyl self-administration and to identify whether distinct escalation phenotypes can be linked to gene expression patterns. Results: Sucrose breakpoints were not predictive of fentanyl acquisition nor change during escalation, but did predict fentanyl intake on the first day of extended access to fentanyl. Permutation analyses did not identify associations between behavior and single gene expression when evaluated overall, or between our ascertained phenotypes. However, weighted genome correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) determined several gene modules linked to escalated fentanyl intake, including genes coding for voltage-gated potassium channels, calcium channels, and genes involved in excitatory synaptic signaling. Transcription factor analyses identified EZH2 and JARID2 as potential transcriptional regulators associated with escalated fentanyl intake. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) term categories were also generated and positively associated with terms relating to substance use disorders. Discussion: Escalation of opioid intake is largely distinct from motivation for natural reward, such as sucrose. Further, the gene networks associated with fentanyl escalation suggest that engagement of select molecular pathways distinguish individuals with ''addiction prone'' behavioral endophenotypes, potentially representing druggable targets for opioid use disorder. Our extended in silico identification of SNPs and transcription factors associated with the ''addiction prone'' high escalating rats highlights the importance of integrating findings from translational preclinical models. Through a precision medicine approach, our results may aid in the development of patient-centered treatment options for those with OUD.

">Perceptual choice and motor signals in mouse somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory cortex activity relates both to sensation and movement, reflecting their intimate relationship, but the extent and nature of sensory-motor interactions in the somatosensory cortex remain unclear. Here, we investigated perception-related sensory and motor signals in the whisker areas of mouse primary (wS1) and secondary (wS2) somatosensory cortices. We recorded neuronal activity while mice performed a whisker detection task using two alternative lickports, one each to indicate the presence or absence of a whisker deflection on a given trial. One group of mice reported the presence of the whisker stimulus by licking at the port on the same ("congruent") side of the animal as the stimulated whisker, whereas a second group of mice did so by licking at the opposite ("incongruent") side. Activity of single neurons in wS1 and wS2 correlated with perceptual choice. This choice-related activity was enhanced when responding to the congruent side. wS2 neurons projecting along two output pathways---to wS1 or to whisker secondary motor cortex, wM2---also showed choice-related activity, but differed in their dependence on congruence and in the effects of optogenetic manipulation. Thus, somatosensory cortex contains pathway- and action-specific choice-related activity.

">Goal-Directed Learning in Cortical Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Experimental neuroscience techniques are advancing rapidly, with major recent developments in high-density electrophysiology and targeted electrical stimulation. In combination with these techniques, cortical organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells show great promise as in vitro models of brain development and function. Although sensory input is vital to neurodevelopment in vivo, few studies have explored the effect of meaningful input to in vitro neural cultures over time. In this work, we demonstrate the first example of goal-directed learning in brain organoids. We developed a closed-loop electrophysiology framework to embody mouse cortical organoids into a simulated dynamical task (the inverted pendulum problem known as "Cartpole") and evaluate learning through specific training signals. Longitudinal experiments enabled by this framework illuminate how different methods of selecting training signals enable improvement on the tasks. We found that for most organoids, training signals chosen by artificial reinforcement learning yield better performance on the task than randomly chosen training signals or the absence of a training signal. This systematic approach to studying learning mechanisms in vitro opens new possibilities for therapeutic interventions and biological computation.

">Biophysical modeling of thalamic reticular nucleus subpopulations and their differential contribution to network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The burst firing mode of thalamic reticular neurons plays a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of sleep rhythms and is implicated in sleep-related deficits characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Although several models of reticular neurons have been developed to date, we currently lack a biophysically detailed model able to accurately reproduce the heterogeneity of burst firing observed experimentally. Using electrophysiology recordings of patch-clamped fluorescently tagged Spp1+ and Ecel1+ reticular neurons, we leverage a previously established statistical framework to introduce differentiation of cell types in model thalamic reticular neurons. We developed a population of biophysically detailed models of thalamic reticular neurons that capture the diversity of their firing properties, particularly their ability to generate rebound bursts. These models incorporate key ion channels, such as T-type Ca and small conductance potassium channels (SK), and enable systematic investigations into the impact of these channels on single-cell dynamics. By integrating these models into a thalamic microcircuit, we demonstrate that T-type Ca and SK channel conductances have opposing effects on spindle oscillations. We identify a simple relationship between these conductances and the peak firing frequency of spindles, maintained across circuits with mixed reticular neuron populations, providing a framework for understanding how ion channel expression influences thalamic network dynamics. Collectively, these models establish a foundation for relating intrinsic cellular properties of reticular cell populations to network-level activity in both healthy and pathological conditions.

">Relationship between Brain and Body Temperature in Anesthetized Animals Measured by Ultralocal Thermometry</a></h4>

              
                Temperature is one of the least studied biophysical characteristics of the brain, although both the rate of biochemical reactions and the electrical activity of nervous tissue directly depend on it. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between brain and body temperatures in anesthetized animals. Simultaneous measurement of brain and body temperature (rectally) was carried out at ambient temperature controlled with a thermal mat. The temperature of the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex was measured by ultralocal thermometry using a diamond thermometer. Under anesthesia, the body and brain temperature dropped to 27 C (4 degrees above ambient temperature). When the thermal mat was turned on, the brain and body began to heat up synchronously. The brain initially lagged behind, but when the critical temperature was reached, it began to release heat in quantities exceeding the influx from the blood, reaching physiological values of 37C. A reverse experiment with decreasing the temperature of the thermal mat showed a similar picture: a synchronous start of the decrease, but with reverse dynamics. Thus, we can distinguish two phases of the brain's reaction to external heating: passive - when neuronal activity is decreased, and active - after internal regulatory mechanisms are triggered, which, in its turn, slows down the temperature drop. In general, the data obtained in the present work indicate that the temperature of neural tissue is not linearly related to body temperature.

">Temporal shift in task factor influence across the stretch reflex</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical perturbations applied to the arm can elicit reflexive actions. These rapid corrective responses include the stretch reflex, which consists of different components: the short-latency reflex (SLR) as well as the early and late long-latency reflex (LLR). In this study, we explore how different task factors dynamically influence these reflex components in the context of a specific delayed-reach paradigm. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), we analysed reflex responses from seven muscles actuating the right arm to examine the effects of mechanical load, preparatory delay, perturbation and target direction, as well as their two-factor interactions. The MLR analysis shows that our delayed-reach tasks engaged shoulder girdle muscles, whereas the biceps and triceps primarily acted as stabilizing muscles, with rapid responses triggered regardless of perturbation direction. Specifically, our analyses show that the earliest corrective response, the SLR, exhibited some task/target-dependent modulation particularly in muscles of the shoulder girdle, although background (pre-)loading decreased this modulation. The SLR was primarily influenced by the main factors Load and Perturbation, along with the interaction Load x Perturbation. Perturbations aligned with the load direction were associated with increased electromyographic (EMG) activity across all examined muscles. While there was a small but significant effect of load during the early LLR, this effect diminished by the late LLR epoch. Task-dependent modulation was most pronounced at the late LLR epoch, suggesting greater top-down modulation of this reflex component. In particular, the late LLR was shaped by the factors Perturbation and Target, as well as the interaction Perturbation x Target. Targets and perturbations in opposing directions resulted in heightened EMG activity, and shoulder muscles exhibited stronger LLR responses for targets located farther along the muscle shortening direction. Across all reflex epochs, a longer preparatory delay (750 ms) was associated with higher EMG activity.

">Phase reset dynamics of memory encoding</a></h4>

              
                Human and animal studies have implicated oscillatory reset following a behaviorally relevant stimulus in learning and memory function. Here we asked whether phase reset predicts the dynamics of memory encoding for subsequently recalled and forgotten items. Our dataset comprised 188 neurosurgical patients (99 male, 89 female) who studied lists of common words for a subsequent delayed free recall test. We observed significant 3-21Hz overall phase reset widespread throughout the brain in the 125-500ms interval following stimulus presentation for both subsequently recalled and forgotten items. We found that the increased recalls of the primacy effect correlated significantly and exclusively with theta phase reset from 3-7Hz throughout the brain. When controlling for serial position effects and examining the phase consistency differences of subsequently recalled and forgotten items, we identified both a theta (3-6Hz) and an alpha (9-14Hz) component of phase reset. Examined separately, early list items revealed a significant theta phase reset difference, while later list items revealed a significant alpha phase reset difference for subsequently recalled items. In regional analyses, the lateral temporal cortex exhibited a significant theta phase reset difference, while the prefrontal cortex revealed both a significant theta and a significant alpha phase reset difference for subsequently recalled items. These findings support the view that oscillatory reset serves an important role in encoding new episodic associations, and reveal differing oscillatory mechanisms across theta and alpha bands for serial position effects of phase reset versus serial position controlled subsequent recall.

">Space- and object-based attention in patientswith a single hemisphere following childhood resection</a></h4>

              
                The neural processes underlying attentional processing are typically lateralized in adults, with spatial attention associated with the right hemisphere (RH) and object-based attention with the left hemisphere (LH). Using a modified two-rectangle attention paradigm, we compared the lateralization profiles of individuals with childhood hemispherectomy (either LH or RH) and age-matched, typically developing controls. Although patients exhibited slower reaction times (RTs) compared to controls, both groups benefited from valid attentional cueing. However, patients experienced significantly higher costs for invalid trials, reflected by larger RT differences between validly and invalidly cued targets. This was true for invalid trials on both cued and uncued objects, probes of object- and space-based attentional processes, respectively. Notably, controls showed no significant RT cost differences between invalidly cued locations on cued versus uncued objects. By contrast, patients exhibited greater RT costs for targets on uncued versus cued objects, suggesting greater difficulty shifting attention across objects. We explore potential explanations for this group difference and the lack of difference between patients with LH or RH resection. These findings enhance our understanding of spatial and object-based attention in typical development and reveal how significant neural injury affects the development of attentional systems in the LH and RH.

">Salience Network Segregation and Symptom Profiles in Psychosis Prodrome Subgroups</a></h4>

              
                Background: Understanding neurobiological similarities between individuals with prodromal psychosis symptoms can improve early identification and intervention strategies. Here, we aimed to (i) identify neurobiologically similar groups by integrating resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal symptom data and (ii) discern discriminating symptom profiles and brain connectivity patterns in the identified sub-groups. Methods: Our sample (N=922) was extracted from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and included individuals ages 12-21 years with fMRI and self-reported psychopathology data. Analyses were conducted separately for youth and early adults. We first constructed a two-layer network using pair-wise similarity distances between participants based on resting-state functional connectivity and prodromal positive psychosis symptoms. We then performed community detection via a multiplex stochastic block model to identify subject clusters. Results: We identified 2 blocks or communities for both the youth (n=458 and 179) and early adult (n=173 and 112) groups. Connection parameter estimates of the neuroimaging layer were nearly identical between blocks for both age groups whereas there was significant variation for the symptom layer. Psychopathology symptom and brain system segregation profiles were consistent across age groups. The youth block (n=458) with higher salience network segregation values had higher mean scores for prodromal symptoms. However, the early adult block (n=173) with lower salience network segregation had higher mean prodromal scores. Conclusions: By integrating global similarities in brain connectivity and prodromal symptoms, we identified distinct subgroups. These groups show differences in symptom profiles and network segregation in youth and early adults, indicating significant variations in developmental paths for psychosis spectrum.

">Alterations in topology, cost and dynamics of gamma-band EEG functional networks in a preclinical model of traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of disability leading to multiple sequelae in cognitive, sensory, and physical domains, including post-traumatic epilepsy. Despite extensive research, our understanding of its impact on macroscopic brain circuitry remains incomplete. We analyzed electrophysiological functional connectomes in the gamma band using a preclinical model of blast-induced traumatic brain injury over multiple time points after injury. We revealed differences in small-world propensity and rich-club structure compared to age-matched controls, indicating functional reorganization following injury. We further investigated cost-efficiency trade-offs, propose a computationally efficient normalization procedure for quantifying cost of spatially embedded networks that controls for connectivity strength differences, and suggest metabolic drivers as a candidate for the observed differences. Furthermore, we employed a brain-wide computational model of seizure dynamics and attribute brain reorganization to a homeostatic mechanism of activity regulation with the potential unintended consequence of driving generalized seizures. Finally, we demonstrated post-injury hyperexcitability that manifests as an increase in sound-evoked response amplitudes at the cortical level. Our work characterizes for the first time gamma-band functional network reorganization in a model of brain injury and proposes potential causes of these changes, thus identifying targets for future therapeutic interventions.

">Loom response in mouse superior colliculus depends on sensorimotor context</a></h4>

              
                Visual motion is produced both by an organism's movement through the world, and by objects moving in the world such as potential predators. Choosing appropriate behaviour therefore requires organisms to distinguish these sources of visual motion. Here we asked how mice integrate self-movement with looming visual motion by combining virtual reality and neural recordings from superior colliculus (SC), a brain area important in visually-guided approach and avoidance behaviours. We first measured locomotion behaviour and neural activity while animals approached an object in virtual reality, and while the same object loomed at them. In both cases, vision dominated activity in superficial layers (SCs), while locomotion had more influence on activity in intermediate layers (SCim). In addition, animals instinctively slowed their locomotion when nearing the object, or when the object neared them. To directly test animals' ability to distinguish self- from object motion we replayed the visual images generated during object approach. Locomotion behaviour often changed during replay, showing animals are able to establish if visual motion is matched to their self-movement. Further, decoders trained on locomotion behaviour, or on population activity in SC, particularly in SCim, were able to reliably discriminate epochs of replay and object approach. We conclude that both mouse behaviour and SC activity encode whether looming visual motion arises from self- or object movement, with implications for understanding sensorimotor coordination in dynamic environments.

">Sensor Movement Drives Emergent Attention and Scalability in Active Neural Cellular Automata</a></h4>

              
                The brain's distributed architecture has inspired numerous artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly through its neocortical organization. However, current AI approaches largely overlook a crucial aspect of biological intelligence: active sensing - the deliberate movement of sensory organs to explore the environment. To explore how sensor movement impacts behavior in classification tasks, we introduce the Active Neural Cellular Automata (ANCA), a neocortex-inspired model with movable sensors. Active sensing naturally emerges in the ANCA, with belief-informed exploration and attentive behavior to salient information, without adding explicit attention mechanisms. Active sensing both simplifies classification tasks and leads to a highly scalable system. This enables ANCAs to be smaller than the image size without losing information and enables fault tolerance to damaged sensors. Overall, our work provides insight to how distributed architectures can interact with movement, opening new avenues for adaptive AI systems in embodied agents.

">The heart rate dynamics and antioxidant capacity under cognitive load in Obsessive-Compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                The research of the oxidants-antioxidants homeostasis and its connection to autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively uncharted field of study. We recruited 31 patients diagnosed with OCD and 29 healthy volunteers to analyze their saliva antioxidant capacity before and after a three-block behavioral task with cognitive and emotional load, during which we assessed heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) patterns. We found that the OCD group had a significantly lower antioxidant capacity (AOC) and showed no increase in AOC after the cognitive task as compared with healthy volunteers. The notable negative correlation between HR and AOC changes led us to select two subgroups inside the OCD and control group: one with high HR and another with low HR. The AOC changes for OCD and healthy participants with high HR were similar, while OCD sub-group with low HR exhibited significantly different changes in AOC compared with the control group. Although HRV did not show a correlation with AOC, the OCD group demonstrated substantially higher increase of very low frequencies (VLF) of 24 HRV during the cognitive task performance and significantly elevated low frequency powers of HRV expressed in normal units (LFnu). OCD sub-group with lower HR exhibited higher LFnu compared to both the patient and the control group with high HR. Our findings imply that OCD patients with elevated sympathetic tone of ANS reflected by initially increased HR show more adaptive AOC to cognitive load.

">Lifespan Normative Models of White Matter Fractional Anisotropy: Applications to Early Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                This study presents large-scale normative models of white matter (WM) organization across the lifespan, using diffusion MRI data from over 25,000 healthy individuals aged 0-100 years. These models capture lifespan trajectories and inter-individual variation in fractional anisotropy (FA), a marker of white matter integrity. By addressing non-Gaussian data distributions, race, and site effects, the models offer reference baselines across diverse ages, ethnicities, and scanning conditions. We applied these FA models to the HCP Early Psychosis cohort and performed a multivariate analysis to map symptoms onto deviations from multimodal normative models using multi-view sparse canonical correlation analysis (msCCA). Our results reveal extensive white matter heterogeneity in psychosis, which is not captured by group-level analyses, with key regions identified, including the right uncinate fasciculus and thalami. These normative models offer valuable tools for individualized WM deviation identification, improving precision in psychiatric assessments. All models are publicly available for community use.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Postpartum depression and postpartum depression with anxiety, which are highly prevalent and debilitating disorders, become a growing public concern. The high overlap on the symptomatic and neurobiological levels led to ongoing debates about their diagnostic and neurobiological uniqueness. Delineating the shared and disorder-specific intrinsic functional connectivities and their causal interactions is fundamental to precision diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we recruited 138 participants including 45 postpartum depression, 31 postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety patients, and 62 healthy postnatal women with age ranging from 23 to 40 years. We combined independent component analysis, resting-state functional connectivity, and Granger causality analysis to reveal the abnormal intrinsic functional couplings and their causal interactions in postpartum depression and postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety from a large-scale brain network perspective. We found that they exhibited widespread abnormalities in intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities. Importantly, the intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities within or between the fronto-parietal network, default model network, ventral and dorsal attention network, sensorimotor network, and visual network, especially the functional imbalances between primary and association cortices could serve as effective neural markers to differentiate postpartum depression, postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety, and healthy controls. Our findings provide the initial evidence for shared and disorder-specific intrinsic and effective functional network connectivities for postpartum depression and postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety, which provide an underlying neuropathological basis for postpartum depression or postpartum depression comorbid with anxiety to facilitate precision diagnosis and therapy in future studies.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Value-based decision-making involves weighing costs and benefits. The activity of the medial prefrontal cortex reflects cost–benefit assessments, and the mediodorsal thalamus, reciprocally connected with the medial prefrontal cortex, has increasingly been recognized as an active partner in decision-making. However, the specific role of the interaction between the mediodorsal thalamus and the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating the neuronal activity underlying how costs and benefits influence decision-making remains largely unexplored. We investigated this by training the rats to perform a self-determined decision-making task, where longer nose poke durations resulted in correspondingly larger rewards. Our results showed that the inactivation of either the medial prefrontal cortex or the mediodorsal thalamus significantly impaired rat to invest more nose poke duration for larger rewards. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex pathway enhanced rats’ motivation for larger rewards, whereas inhibition of this pathway resulted in decreased motivation. Notably, we identified a specific population of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex that exhibited firing patterns correlated with motivation, and these neurons were modulated by the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex projection. These findings suggest that the motivation during decision-making is encoded primarily by activity of particular neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and indicate the crucial role of the mediodorsal thalamus–medial prefrontal cortex pathway in maintaining motivation.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Innovative therapies are needed to reduce disability, facilitate activities of daily living, and improve the quality of life in patients with stroke. Non-invasive methods of stimulating the peripheral and central nervous system are increasingly being used to enhance the effects of existing therapies in stroke rehabilitation. One potentially relevant method for achieving greater improvement is repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS). This randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Peripheral MAgnetic stimulation in patients with spastic hemiparesis after Stroke Trial (REPMAST), will investigate whether rPMS improves upper extremity function, spasticity, and activities of daily living in patients with stroke compared with neuromuscular stimulation (NMS). Methods: REPMAST is an interventional, randomized controlled single-blinded study. Patients with subacute stroke are randomized to receive rPMS or NMS five days a week for three weeks in addition to standard rehabilitation therapy. The primary outcome is the change in the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity between the beginning and end of the stimulation sessions. Secondary outcomes include changes in the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, the Timed Up and Go Test, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Tardieu Scale. A total sample size of 138 patients (69 in each group) is required to investigate the superiority of rPMS compared with NMS. Conclusions: The aim of this RCT is to provide evidence for an effective peripheral stimulation treatment for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this study is to shed light on activity-based prospective memory upon the awakening and its association with motor sleep inertia in different phenotypes of insomnia disorder. Methods: To this end, 67 patients with insomnia and 51 healthy controls took part in the study. After enrollment, previously proposed actigraphic quantitative criteria were adopted, and the following phenotypes of insomnia disorder were observed in the patient sample: sleep onset (n = 12), maintenance (n = 19), mixed (n = 17), and negative misperception (n = 19). Each participant had used the Micro Motionlogger Watch (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) actigraph for one week. Actigraphic recording allowed for a description of both the activity-based prospective memory performance upon the awakening&amp;amp;mdash;by computing the time interval between sleep end and the time participants actually remembered to push the event-marker button of the actigraph&amp;amp;mdash;and the motor sleep inertia, i.e., the mean motor activity, minute-by-minute, in the first 60 min after sleep end in the morning. Results: Compared to healthy controls, a longer time interval was observed between sleep end and activity-based prospective memory performance in patients with mixed and maintenance insomnia. Moreover, a significant association was highlighted between motor sleep inertia and the activity-based prospective memory performance: higher levels of motor activity in those who remembered to perform the memory task early after sleep end, that spread over a longer time interval in maintenance and mixed insomnia. Conclusions: Overall, the present results seem to highlight a more marked cognitive inertia in patients with mixed and maintenance insomnia as well as a significant association between motor and cognitive inertia that spreads over a different time interval according to the phenotype of insomnia.</p>

	<p>Background: In this study, we aimed to comparatively evaluate the morphology of internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcations with and without aneurysms and identify risk factors for aneurysm development that are associated with the bifurcation geometry. Method: In this two-center study, the computerized tomography angiography data of 1512 patients were evaluated. The study included 64 (4.2%) patients with ICA bifurcation aneurysms (ICAbifAn) and patients with anterior circulation aneurysms (non-ICAbifAn). ICA (P1) was defined as the parent artery, and the middle (M1) and anterior (A1) cerebral artery segments were defined as daughter arteries. We measured the diameters of the P1, M1, and A1 and their ratios (BifSR) to identify the risk factors. In addition, we calculated the bifurcation angle in two ways by measuring all angles between the P1 and daughter arteries and compared these two methods. The first method was the angle between the M1 and A1 (&amp;amp;alpha;), and the second was the sum of the angles between the P1 and daughter arteries (BifA). Result: A total of 163 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study: 58 patients in the ICAbifAn group and 105 patients in the non-ICAbifAn group. A univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the P1, BifSR, &amp;amp;alpha;, and BifA measurements were significant predictors of aneurysm formation. However, after a multivariate analysis, only the BifA angle retained its significance (OR, 0.911 (0.877&amp;amp;ndash;0.946), p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the ROC curve, the optimal BifA threshold for accurately differentiating between an ICAbifAn and non-aneurysmal bifurcation was 210&amp;amp;deg; (area under the curve (AUC), 0.81; sensitivity, 69%; and specificity, 87%). The &amp;amp;alpha; angle had an AUC of 0.68. Conclusions: These results suggest that bifurcation geometry plays a significant role in the likelihood of aneurysm formation. We also showed that the BifA was more predictive of aneurysm formation than the &amp;amp;alpha; angle.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) is a common disease in childhood, but its impact on the vestibular system remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of rAOM on balance and vestibular function in pediatric patients. Methods: A total of 55 children, aged 8 years (25 males and 30 females), with a documented history of rAOM, no AOM episodes in the past year, and no previous ear surgery were assessed. Static posturography was used to assess postural instability, measuring sway area (SX, mm2) under four conditions: eyes open and eyes closed, with and without foam pads. Vestibular function was evaluated using the video head impulse test (v-HIT) to quantify vestibulo&amp;amp;ndash;ocular reflex (VOR) gain and corrective saccades across all six semicircular canals. Results: Children with a history of rAOM demonstrated significantly greater postural instability than healthy controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 for all test conditions). The number of AOM episodes was the primary factor influencing balance dysfunction, with children who had more than eight episodes showing the most pronounced deficits in postural stability (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In some cases, the v-HIT revealed hypofunction in the right anterior (14.5%), left posterior (7.3%), left lateral (5.5%), left anterior (3.6%), and right posterior (3.6%) semicircular canals. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that rAOM can lead to lasting balance and vestibular dysfunction, highlighting the importance of early monitoring and potential rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background and objective: Staging Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) with a novel simple classification called MNCD, based on four axes (Motor; Non-motor; Cognition; Dependency) and five stages, correlated with disease severity, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; strain and burden. Our aim was to apply the MNCD classification in advanced PD patients treated with device-aided therapy (DAT). Patients and Methods: A multicenter observational retrospective study of the first patients to start the levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) in Spain was performed (LECIPARK study). The MNCD total score (from 0 to 12) and MNCD stages (from 1 to 5) were collected by the neurologist at V0 (before starting LECIG) and V2 (follow-up visit). Wilcoxon&amp;amp;rsquo;s signed rank and Marginal Homogeneity tests were applied to compare changes from V0 to V2. Results: Sixty-seven PD patients (58.2% males; 69.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.3 years old) with a mean disease duration of 14.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.5 years were included. The mean treatment duration (V2) was 172.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 105.2 days. At V0, patients were classified as in stage 2 (35.8%), 3 (46.3%) or 4 (17.9%). The frequency of patients in stage 4 decreased to 9% at V2 (p = 0.001). The MNCD total score decreased from 6.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.94 at V0 to 5.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.23 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). From V0 to V2, the motor (M; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and non-motor symptom (N; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) burden decreased, and autonomy for the activities of daily living (D; p = 0.005) improved. Conclusions: The MNCD classification could be useful to classify advanced PD patients and to monitor the response to a DAT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/50/e0166242024?rss=1">The Relationship between White Matter Architecture and Language Lateralization in the Healthy Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interhemispheric anatomical differences have long been thought to be related to language lateralization. Previous studies have explored whether asymmetries in the diffusion characteristics of white matter language tracts are consistent with language lateralization. These studies, typically with smaller cohorts, yielded mixed results. This study investigated whether connectomic analysis of quantitative anisotropy (QA) and shape features of white matter tracts across the whole brain are associated with language lateralization. We analyzed 1,040 healthy individuals (562 females) from the Human Connectome Project database. Hemispheric language dominance for each participant was quantified using a laterality quotient (LQ) derived from fMRI activation in regions of interest (ROIs) associated with a language comprehension task compared against a math task. A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between structural asymmetry and functional lateralization. Connectometry revealed a significant negative correlation between LQs and QA of corpus callosum tracts, indicating that higher QA in these regions is associated with bilateral and right hemisphere language representation in frontal and temporal regions. Left language laterality in the temporal lobe was significantly associated with longer right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and forceps minor tracts. These results suggest that diffusion measures of microstructural architecture as well as geometrical features of reconstructed white matter tracts play a role in language lateralization. People with increased dependence on the right or both frontal hemispheres for language processing may have more developed commissural fibers, which may support more efficient interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, characterized by significant neurodegeneration of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Early stages of the disease are characterized by the loss of dopamine 2 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D2 MSNs) followed by degeneration of dopamine 1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1 MSNs), leading to aberrant basal ganglia signaling. While the early degeneration of D2 MSNs and impaired GABAergic transmission are well-documented, potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a key regulator of intracellular chloride (Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>), and therefore GABAergic signaling, has not been characterized in D1 and D2 MSNs in HD. We aimed to investigate whether Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the early degeneration of D2 MSNs in male and female symptomatic R6/2 mice. We used electrophysiology to record the reversal potential for GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (<I>E</I><SUB>GABA</SUB>), a read-out for the efficacy of Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation, in striatal D1 and D2 MSNs and their corresponding output structures. During the early symptomatic phase (P55&ndash;P65), Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> impairments were observed in D2 MSNs in R6/2 mice, with no change in D1 MSNs. Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> regulation was also dysfunctional in the globus pallidus externa, resulting in GABA-mediated excitation. When we overexpressed KCC2 in D2 MSNs using AAV-mediated delivery, we delayed the onset of motor impairments in R6/2 mice. We demonstrate that Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> homeostasis is differentially altered in D1 and D2 MSNs and may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of D2 MSNs during HD progression.</p>

                <p>NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated calcium influx triggers the induction and initial expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here we report that in male rodents, ion flux-independent (metabotropic) NMDAR signaling is critical for a third step in the production of enduring LTP, i.e., cytoskeletal changes that stabilize the activity-induced synaptic modifications. Surprisingly, females rely upon estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) for the metabotropic NMDAR operations used by males. Blocking NMDAR channels with MK-801 eliminated LTP expression in hippocampal field CA1 of both sexes but left intact theta burst stimulation (TBS)-induced actin polymerization within dendritic spines. A selective antagonist (Ro25-6981) of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit had minimal effects on synaptic responses but blocked actin polymerization and LTP consolidation in males only. Conversely, an ER&alpha; antagonist thoroughly disrupted TBS-induced actin polymerization and LTP in females while having no evident effect in males. In an episodic memory paradigm, Ro25-6981 prevented acquisition of spatial locations by males but not females, whereas an ER&alpha; antagonist blocked acquisition in females but not males. Sex differences in LTP consolidation were accompanied by pronounced differences in episodic memory in tasks involving minimal (for learning) cue sampling. Males did better on acquisition of spatial information whereas females had much higher scores than males on tests for acquisition of the identity of cues (episodic "what") and the order in which the cues were sampled (episodic "when"). We propose that sex differences in synaptic processes used to stabilize LTP result in differential encoding of the basic elements of episodic memory.</p>

                <p>Protocadherins, a family of adhesion molecules with a crucial role in cell&ndash;cell interactions, have emerged as key players in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In particular, growing evidence links genetic alterations in the protocadherin 9 (<I>PCDH9</I>) gene with autism spectrum disorder and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, <I>Pcdh9</I> deletion induces neuronal defects in the mouse somatosensory cortex, accompanied by sensorimotor and memory impairment. However, the synaptic and molecular mechanisms of <I>PCDH9</I> in the brain remain largely unknown, particularly concerning its impact on brain pathology. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of PCDH9&rsquo;s role in the male mouse hippocampus at the ultrastructural, biochemical, transcriptomic, electrophysiological, and network levels. We show that PCDH9 mainly localizes at glutamatergic synapses and its expression peaks in the first week after birth, a crucial time window for synaptogenesis. Strikingly, <I>Pcdh9</I> KO neurons exhibit oversized presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic density in the CA1. Synapse overgrowth is sustained by the widespread upregulation of synaptic genes, as revealed by single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), and the dysregulation of key drivers of synapse morphogenesis, including the SHANK2/CORTACTIN pathway. At the functional level, these structural and transcriptional abnormalities result in increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) and reduced network activity in the CA1 of <I>Pcdh9</I> KO mice. In conclusion, our work uncovers <I>Pcdh9</I>&rsquo;s pivotal role in shaping the morphology and function of CA1 excitatory synapses, thereby modulating glutamatergic transmission within hippocampal circuits.</p>

                <p>While previous works established the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations during working memory maintenance, it remains an open question whether such an inhibitory control is a top-down process. Here, we attempted to disentangle this issue by considering the spatiotemporal component of waves in the alpha band, i.e., alpha traveling waves. We reanalyzed two pre-existing and open-access EEG datasets (<I>N</I> = 180, 90 males, 80 females, 10 unknown) where participants performed lateralized, visual delayed match-to-sample working memory tasks. In the first dataset, the distractor load was manipulated (2, 4, or 6), whereas in the second dataset, the memory span varied between 1, 3, and 6 items. We focused on the propagation of alpha waves on the anterior-posterior axis during the retention period. Our results reveal an increase in alpha-band forward waves as the distractor load increased, but also an increase in forward waves and a decrease in backward waves as the memory set size increased. Our results also showed a lateralization effect: alpha forward waves exhibited a more pronounced increase in the hemisphere contralateral to the distractors, whereas the reduction in backward waves was stronger in the hemisphere contralateral to the targets. In short, the forward waves were regulated by distractors, whereas targets inversely modulated backward waves. Such a dissociation of goal-related and goal-irrelevant physiological signals suggests the coexistence of bottom-up and top-down inhibitory processes: alpha forward waves might convey a gating effect driven by distractor load, while backward waves may represent direct top-down gain control of downstream visual areas.</p>

                <p>Mutations in human <I>VPS4A</I> are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, including motor delays and defective muscle tone. <I>VPS4A</I> encodes a AAA-ATPase required for membrane scission, but how mutations in <I>VPS4A</I> lead to impaired control of motor function is not known. Here we identified a mutation in zebrafish <I>vps4a</I>, T248I, that affects sensorimotor transformation. Biochemical analyses indicate that the T248I mutation reduces the ATPase activity of Vps4a and disassembly of ESCRT filaments, which mediate membrane scission. Consistent with the role for Vps4a in exosome biogenesis, <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae have enlarged endosomal compartments in the CNS and decreased numbers of circulating exosomes in brain ventricles. Resembling the central form of hypotonia in <I>VPS4A</I> patients, motor neurons and muscle cells are functional in mutant zebrafish. Both somatosensory and vestibular inputs robustly evoke tail and eye movements, respectively. In contrast, optomotor responses, vestibulospinal, and acoustic startle reflexes are absent or strongly impaired in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> larvae, indicating a greater sensitivity of these circuits to the T248I mutation. ERG recordings revealed intensity-dependent deficits in the retina, and in vivo calcium imaging of the auditory pathway identified a moderate reduction in afferent neuron activity, partially accounting for the severe motor impairments in mutant larvae. Further investigation of central pathways in <I>vps4a<sup>T248I</sup></I> mutants showed that activation of descending vestibulospinal and midbrain motor command neurons by sensory cues is strongly reduced. Our results suggest that defects in sensorimotor transformation underlie the profound yet selective effects on motor reflexes resulting from the loss of membrane scission mediated by Vps4a.</p>

                <p>Cognitive control is engaged by working memory processes and high-demand situations like antisaccade, where one must suppress a prepotent response. While it is known to be supported by the frontoparietal control network, how intra- and interareal dynamics contribute to cognitive control processes remains unclear. <I>N</I>-Methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play a key role in prefrontal dynamics that support cognitive control. NMDAR antagonists, such as ketamine, are known to alter task-related prefrontal activities and impair cognitive performance. However, the role of NMDAR in cognitive control-related frontoparietal dynamics remains underexplored. Here, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and single-unit activities from the lateral prefrontal (lPFC) and posterior parietal cortices (PPC) in two male macaque monkeys during a rule-based antisaccade task, with both rule-visible (RV) and rule-memorized (RM) conditions. In addition to altering the E/I balance in both areas, ketamine had a negative impact on rule coding in true oscillatory activities. It also reduced frontoparietal coherence in a frequency- and rule-dependent manner. Granger prediction analysis revealed that ketamine induced an overall reduction in bidirectional connectivity. Among antisaccade trials, a greater reduction in lPFC&ndash;PPC connectivity during the delay period preceded a greater delay in saccadic onset under the RM condition and a greater deficit in performance under the RV condition. Lastly, ketamine compromised rule coding in lPFC neurons in both RV and RM conditions and in PPC neurons only in the RV condition. Our findings demonstrate the utility of acute NMDAR antagonists in understanding the mechanisms through which frontoparietal dynamics support cognitive control processes.</p>

                <p>Barn owls enable investigation of neural mechanisms underlying stimulus selection of concurrent stimuli. The audiovisual space map in the optic tectum (OT), avian homolog of the superior colliculus, encodes relative strength of concurrent auditory stimuli through spike response rate and interneuronal spike train synchrony (STS). Open questions remain regarding stimulus selection in downstream forebrain regions lacking topographic coding of auditory space, including the functional consequences of interneuronal STS on interregional signaling. To this end, we presented concurrent stimuli at different locations and manipulated relative strength while simultaneously recording neural responses from OT and its downstream thalamic target, nucleus rotundus (nRt), in awake barn owls of both sexes. Results demonstrated that broadly spatially tuned nRt units exhibit different spike response patterns to competition depending on spatial tuning preferences. Modeling suggests nRt units integrate convergent inputs from distant locations across midbrain map regions. Additionally, STS within nRt reflects the temporal properties of the strongest stimulus. Furthermore, interregional STS between OT and nRt was strongest when spatial tuning overlap between units across regions was large and when the strongest stimulus location during competition was favorable for units in both regions. Additionally, though gamma oscillations synthesized within OT are weakly propagated within nRt, average gamma power across regions correlates with strength of interregional STS. Overall, we demonstrate that nRt integrates inputs across distant areas of OT, retains spatial information through differences in strength of inputs from various locations of the midbrain map across neurons, and prioritizes coding of identity features to the strongest sound.</p>

                <p>Impairments in synaptic dynamics and stability are observed both in neurodegenerative disorders and in the healthy aging cortex, which exhibits elevated dendritic spine turnover and decreased long-term stability of excitatory connections at baseline, as well as an altered response to plasticity induction. In addition to the discrete gain and loss of synapses, spines also change in size and strength both during learning and in the absence of neural activity, and synaptic volume has been associated with stability and incorporation into memory traces. Furthermore, intrinsic dynamics, an apparently stochastic component of spine volume changes, may serve as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent stabilization of superfluous connections. However, the effects of age on modulation of synaptic weights remain unknown. Using two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy of spines during chemical plasticity induction in vitro and analyzing longitudinal in vivo 2PE images after a plasticity-inducing manipulation, we characterize the effects of age on volumetric changes of spines of the apical tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Aged mice exhibit decreased volumetric volatility and delayed rearrangement of synaptic weights of persistent connections, as well as greater susceptibility to spine shrinkage in response to chemical long-term depression. These results suggest a deficit in the aging brain&rsquo;s ability to fine-tune synaptic weights to properly incorporate and retain novel memories. This research provides the first evidence of alterations in spine volumetric dynamics in healthy aging and may support a model of impaired processing and learning in the aged somatosensory system.</p>

                <p>Hostility often co-occurs in parents and associates with increased aggression and inattention problems in children. In this population-based cohort of 484 mother&ndash;father&ndash;child neuroimaging trios, we investigated the degree to which associations of prenatal and childhood parental hostility would be associated with maternal, paternal, and child brain structural differences. Also, we examined whether hippocampal volumes of the parents or child mediate the association of prenatal parental hostility with child externalizing behaviors. Maternal and paternal hostility was assessed with the hostility subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory at three time points: prenatally at 30&nbsp;weeks&rsquo; gestation and when the child was 3 and 10&nbsp;years old. During adolescence assessment wave (age 14), maternal, paternal, and offspring assessment included a magnetic resonance imaging. Child externalizing problems were assessed with Youth Self-Report Child Behavior Checklist. Our findings suggest that maternal and paternal hostility were each associated with smaller gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes of their own and their partner's brain. Prenatal maternal but not paternal hostility was associated with smaller total gray matter, white matter, and hippocampal volumes in the offspring. The child's hippocampal volumes partially mediated the associations of prenatal parental hostility (latent construct) with adolescent externalizing behavior, even after adjusting for prior child externalizing problems. Moreover, parental psychopathology may have long-lasting neurodevelopmental correlates in children that underlie the intergenerational transmission of behavioral problems. The behavior of family members results from a system of interdependent dyadic relationships over time that associate with specific brain structural differences.</p>

                Background We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the two procedures using a pooled analysis of multiple scales, as there has been dispute among the research on the use of autografts or allografts. Methods We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for articles that fulfilled our aim. The search strategy was based on three main keywords: “Autograft”, “Allograft”, and “Anterior Cruciate Ligament. The resulting articles were collected and uploaded to Rayyan. All statistical procedures were performed using Review Manager software version 5.4. We conducted a pooled analysis of continuous variables using mean difference (MD), while for dichotomous variables, we used the pooled analysis of odds ratio (OR) by extraction of event and total. Results Autograft showed better outcomes regarding IKDC score compared to allograft with MD of 1.89 (95%CI: 0.37, 3.42. p=0.02), and I2=66%, p=0.002. It was also associated with better Lysholm and Tegner scores with MD of 1.48 (95%CI: 0.19, 2.77, p=0.02), and 0.32 (0.15, 0.49, p=0.0003), respectively, with no significant heterogeneity in both. Autografts were associated with a higher OR of grade 0 in the Lachmann score with an OR of 2.6 (95%CI: 1.26, 5.38, p=0.01), while allografts had higher odds of having grades 2 and 3 (OR, 0.53 (95%CI, 0.31, 0.93; p=0.03), and 0.48 (95%CI: 0.27, 0.84, p=0.01), respectively Conclusion Compared to allografts, the use of autografts in ACL reconstruction is associated with better functional, structural, stability, and satisfaction outcomes, as observed by statistically significant differences in IKDC, Tegner, Lachmann, Pivot shift test, and Lysholm. However, no differences were observed in ROM, Daniel’s one-leg hop test, or Harner’s vertical jump.

                <p>by George E. Kapellos, Hermann J. Eberl, Nicolas Kalogerakis, Patrick S. Doyle, Christakis A. Paraskeva</p>

Multifaceted interactions between marine bacteria and particulate matter exert a major control over the biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. At the microbial scale, free-living bacteria benefit from encountering and harnessing the plumes around nutrient-releasing particles, like phyto-plankton and organic aggregates. However, our understanding of the bacterial potential to reshape these eutrophic microhabitats remains poor, in part because of the traditional focus on fast-moving particles that generate ephemeral plumes with lifetime shorter than the uptake timescale. Here we develop a novel hybrid model to assess the impacts of nutrient uptake by clustered free-living bacteria on the nutrient field around slow-moving particles. We integrate a physics-based nutrient transport model with data-derived bacterial distributions at the single-particle level. We inferred the functional form of the bacterial distribution and extracted parameters from published datasets of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> microscale experiments. Based on available data, we find that exponential radial distribution functions properly represent bacterial microzones, but also capture the trend and variation for the exposure of bacteria to nutrients around sinking particles. Our computational analysis provides fundamental insight into the conditions under which free-living bacteria may significantly reshape plumes around marine aggregates in terms of the particle size and sinking velocity, the nutrient diffusivity, and the bacterial trophic lifestyle (oligotrophs < mesotrophs < copiotrophs). A high potential is predicted for chemotactic copiotrophs like Vibrio sp. that achieve fast uptake and strong clustering. This microscale phenomenon can be critical for the microbiome and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems, especially during particulate blooms.

Experiments comparing diploids with polyploids and in single grassland sites show that nitrogen and/or phosphorus availability influences plant growth and community composition dependent on genome size; specifically, plants with larger genomes grow faster under nutrient enrichments relative to those with smaller genomes. However, it is unknown if these effects are specific to particular site localities with speciifc plant assemblages, climates, and historical contingencies. To determine the generality of genome size-dependent growth responses to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, we combined genome size and species abundance data from 27 coordinated grassland nutrient addition experiments in the Nutrient Network that occur in the Northern Hemisphere across a range of climates and grassland communities. We found that after nitrogen treatment, species with larger genomes generally increased more in cover compared to those with smaller genomes, potentially due to a release from nutrient limitation. Responses were strongest for C<sub>3</sub> grasses and in less seasonal, low precipitation environments, indicating that genome size effects on water-use-efficiency modulates genome size–nutrient interactions. Cumulatively, the data suggest that genome size is informative and improves predictions of species’ success in grassland communities.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The development of the brain's vascular system is a predominantly prenatal process in mammalian species and is required for neurogenesis and further brain development. Our recent work on fetal pig has revealed that many neurodevelopmental processes start well before birth and proceed rapidly reaching near-mature status already around birth. Here, we analyzed the development of neocortical vasculature from embryonic day (E) 45 onward (gestation in pig lasts 114 days) using qualitative and quantitative image analyses and protein blots. In all cortical layers, vessel volume from total brain volume at E100 resembled that of a postnatal day (P) 30 piglet. Endothelial cells expressed the tight junction protein claudin-5 from E45 onward. GFAP+ and AQP4+ astrocytes, PDGFRβ+ pericytes, and α-SMA+ smooth muscle cells are detectable near vessels at E60 suggesting an early assembly of blood–brain barrier components. The vascular system in the visual cortex is advanced before birth with an almost mature pattern at E100. Findings were confirmed by blots that showed a steady increase of expression of tight junction and angiogenesis-related proteins (claudin-5, occludin, VE-cadherin, PECAM-1/CD31) from E65 onward until P90. The expression profile was similar in visual and somatosensory cortex. Together, we report a rapid maturation of the vascular system in pig cortex.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>My most important contribution to research on the hippocampus was the discovery that certain phylogenetically ancient subcortical nuclei that carry information about motivation, emotions and autonomic state exert their profound effects on hippocampal functions by selectively innervating interneurons. Diverse effects on network activity patterns and plasticity can be achieved via activating or inhibiting these functionally distinct interneuron types. In the following, I will present the series of serendipitous events that prompted me to shift my research interest from the visual cortex and the basal ganglia to the hippocampus and its subcortical control.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In 1978, Mort Mishkin published a landmark paper describing a monkey model of H.M.'s dense, global amnesia. It depended on a combined removal of the amygdala and hippocampus (the A + H lesion) and a memory test called delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS). My first project examined whether the impairment Mishkin had found in visual memory generalized to tactual stimuli. However, to gain access to the hippocampus and amygdala with 1980s surgical methods, we had to remove the underlying cortex. When we were able to test the effects of bilateral removal of that underlying cortex (the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, or “rhinal cortex” for short) we obtained a dramatic result. This so-called “control” lesion caused a profound impairment on the DNMS task. A few years later, excitotoxic A + H lesions, which left the rhinal cortex intact, confirmed that removal of the cortical “impediments” had caused the entire memory impairment that Mishkin had observed. These results: (1) forced a reconsideration of the monkey model of global anterograde amnesia; (2) spurred study of the independent contributions of the amygdala, hippocampus, and perirhinal cortex to cognition; and (3) led to the realization that the DNMS task did not test the kinds of memory that H.M. lost after his surgery.</p>

     alt="Neuroarchitecture of the Central Complex in the Madeira Cockroach Rhyparobia maderae: Tangential Neurons"/>
<p>The central complex is a group of interconnected neuropils spanning the midline of the insect brain. In the Madeira cockroach, we identified 27 types of tangential neuron providing input from various brain areas to different compartments of the central complex. The study complements our analysis of neuronal cell types of the cockroach central complex and sheds further light on species-specific modifications of circuitries underlying goal-directed navigation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Navigating in diverse environments to find food, shelter, or mating partners is an important ability for nearly all animals. Insects have evolved diverse navigational strategies to survive in challenging and unknown environments. In the insect brain, the central complex (CX) plays an important role in spatial orientation and directed locomotion. It consists of the protocerebral bridge (PB), the central body with upper (CBU) and lower division (CBL), and the paired noduli (NO). As shown in various insect species, the CX integrates multisensory cues, including sky compass signals, wind direction, and ego-motion to provide goal-directed vector output used for steering locomotion and flight. While most of these data originate from studies on day-active insects, less is known about night-active species such as cockroaches. Following our analysis of columnar and pontine neurons, the present study complements our investigation of the cellular architecture of the CX of the Madeira cockroach by analyzing tangential neurons. Based on single-cell tracer injections, we provide further details on the internal organization of the CX and distinguished 27 types of tangential neuron, including three types of neuron innervating the PB, six types of the CBL, and 18 types of the CBU. The anterior lip, a brain area unknown in flies and highly reduced in bees, and the crepine are strongly connected to the cockroach CBU in contrast to other insect species. One tangential neuron of the CBU revealed a direct connection between the mushroom bodies and the CBU.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94425">Impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature of pathologic post-natal alveolar simplification</a></h4>

              
                Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have impaired alveolar gas exchange due to alveolar simplification and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. Advances in clinical care have improved survival for infants with BPD, but the overall incidence of BPD remains unchanged because we lack specific therapies to prevent this disease. Recent work has suggested a role for increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling and myofibroblast populations in BPD pathogenesis, but the functional significance of each remains unclear. Here, we utilize multiple murine models of alveolar simplification and comparative single-cell RNA sequencing to identify shared mechanisms that could contribute to BPD pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a profound loss of myofibroblasts in two models of BPD and identifies gene expression signatures of increased TGFβ signaling, cell cycle arrest, and impaired proliferation in myofibroblasts. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we find no evidence that increased TGFβ signaling in the lung mesenchyme contributes to alveolar simplification. In contrast, this is likely a failed compensatory response, since none of our approaches to inhibit TGFβ signaling protect mice from alveolar simplification due to hyperoxia while several make simplification worse. In contrast, we find that impaired myofibroblast proliferation is a central feature in several murine models of BPD, and we show that inhibiting myofibroblast proliferation is sufficient to cause pathologic alveolar simplification. Our results underscore the importance of impaired myofibroblast proliferation as a central feature of alveolar simplification and suggest that efforts to reverse this process could have therapeutic value in BPD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100256">Malaria parasites require a divergent heme oxygenase for apicoplast gene expression and biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Malaria parasites have evolved unusual metabolic adaptations that specialize them for growth within heme-rich human erythrocytes. During blood-stage infection, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites internalize and digest abundant host hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole. This massive catabolic process generates copious free heme, most of which is biomineralized into inert hemozoin. Parasites also express a divergent heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein (PfHO) that lacks key active-site residues and has lost canonical HO activity. The cellular role of this unusual protein that underpins its retention by parasites has been unknown. To unravel PfHO function, we first determined a 2.8 Å-resolution X-ray structure that revealed a highly α-helical fold indicative of distant HO homology. Localization studies unveiled PfHO targeting to the apicoplast organelle, where it is imported and undergoes N-terminal processing but retains most of the electropositive transit peptide. We observed that conditional knockdown of PfHO was lethal to parasites, which died from defective apicoplast biogenesis and impaired isoprenoid-precursor synthesis. Complementation and molecular-interaction studies revealed an essential role for the electropositive N-terminus of PfHO, which selectively associates with the apicoplast genome and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. PfHO knockdown resulted in a specific deficiency in levels of apicoplast-encoded RNA but not DNA. These studies reveal an essential function for PfHO in apicoplast maintenance and suggest that <i>Plasmodium</i> repurposed the conserved HO scaffold from its canonical heme-degrading function in the ancestral chloroplast to fulfill a critical adaptive role in organelle gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101439">Pharyngeal neuronal mechanisms governing sour taste perception in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Sour taste, which is elicited by low pH, may serve to help animals distinguish appetitive from potentially harmful food sources. In all species studied to date, the attractiveness of oral acids is contingent on concentration. Many carboxylic acids are attractive at ecologically relevant concentrations but become aversive beyond some maximal concentration. Recent work found that <i>Drosophila</i> ionotropic receptors IR25a and IR76b expressed by sweet-responsive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the labellum, a peripheral gustatory organ, mediate appetitive feeding behaviors toward dilute carboxylic acids. Here, we disclose the existence of pharyngeal sensors in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> that detect ingested carboxylic acids and are also involved in the appetitive responses to carboxylic acids. These pharyngeal sensors rely on IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h, together with IR25a and IR76b, to drive responses to carboxylic acids. We then demonstrate that optogenetic activation of either <i>Ir94a</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>Ir94h</i><sup>+</sup> GRNs promotes an appetitive feeding response, confirming their contributions to appetitive feeding behavior. Our discovery of internal pharyngeal sour taste receptors opens up new avenues for investigating the internal sensation of tastants in insects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96603">Stable sequential dynamics in prefrontal cortex represents subjective estimation of time</a></h4>

              
                Time estimation is an essential prerequisite underlying various cognitive functions. Previous studies identified ‘sequential firing’ and ‘activity ramps’ as the primary neuron activity patterns in the medial frontal cortex (mPFC) that could convey information regarding time. However, the relationship between these patterns and the timing behavior has not been fully understood. In this study, we utilized in vivo calcium imaging of mPFC in rats performing a timing task. We observed cells that showed selective activation at trial start, end, or during the timing interval. By aligning long-term time-lapse datasets, we discovered that sequential patterns of time coding were stable over weeks, while cells coding for trial start or end showed constant dynamism. Furthermore, with a novel behavior design that allowed the animal to determine individual trial interval, we were able to demonstrate that real-time adjustment in the sequence procession speed closely tracked the trial-to-trial interval variations. And errors in the rats’ timing behavior can be primarily attributed to the premature ending of the time sequence. Together, our data suggest that sequential activity maybe a stable neural substrate that represents time under physiological conditions. Furthermore, our results imply the existence of a unique cell type in the mPFC that participates in the time-related sequences. Future characterization of this cell type could provide important insights in the neural mechanism of timing and related cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99951">Emergence of power-law distributions in protein-protein interaction networks through study bias</a></h4>

              
                Degree distributions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are believed to follow a power law (PL). However, technical and study bias affect the experimental procedures for detecting PPIs. For instance, cancer-associated proteins have received disproportional attention. Moreover, bait proteins in large-scale experiments tend to have many false-positive interaction partners. Studying the degree distributions of thousands of PPI networks of controlled provenance, we address the question if PL distributions in observed PPI networks could be explained by these biases alone. Our findings are supported by mathematical models and extensive simulations and indicate that study bias and technical bias suffice to produce the observed PL distribution. It is, hence, problematic to derive hypotheses about the topology of the true biological interactome from the PL distributions in observed PPI networks. Our study casts doubt on the use of the PL property of biological networks as a modeling assumption or quality criterion in network biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96140">Associative plasticity of granule cell inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Granule cells of the cerebellum make up to 175,000 excitatory synapses on a single Purkinje cell, encoding the wide variety of information from the mossy fibre inputs into the cerebellar cortex. The granule cell axon is made of an ascending portion and a long parallel fibre extending at right angles, an architecture suggesting that synapses formed by the two segments of the axon could encode different information. There are controversial indications that ascending axon (AA) and parallel fibre (PF) synapse properties and modalities of plasticity are different. We tested the hypothesis that AA and PF synapses encode different information, and that the association of these distinct inputs to Purkinje cells might be relevant to the circuit and trigger plasticity, similar to the coincident activation of PF and climbing fibre inputs. Here, by recording synaptic currents in Purkinje cells from either proximal or distal granule cells (mostly AA and PF synapses, respectively), we describe a new form of associative plasticity between these two distinct granule cell inputs. We show for the first time that synchronous AA and PF repetitive train stimulation, with inhibition intact, triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) at AA synapses specifically. Furthermore, the timing of the presentation of the two inputs controls the outcome of plasticity and induction requires NMDAR and mGluR1 activation. The long length of the PFs allows us to preferentially activate the two inputs independently, and despite a lack of morphological reconstruction of the connections, these observations reinforce the suggestion that AA and PF synapses have different coding capabilities and plasticity that is associative, enabling effective association of information transmitted via granule cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102912">Novel class IIb microcins show activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE and plant pathogens</a></h4>

              
                Interspecies interactions involving direct competition <i>via</i> bacteriocin production play a vital role in shaping ecological dynamics within microbial ecosystems. For instance, the ribosomally produced siderophore bacteriocins, known as class IIb microcins, affect the colonization of host-associated pathogenic <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> species. Notably, to date, only five of these antimicrobials have been identified, all derived from specific <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> strains. We hypothesized that class IIb microcin production extends beyond these specific compounds and organisms. With a customized informatics-driven approach, screening bacterial genomes in public databases with BLAST and manual curation, we have discovered 12 previously unknown class IIb microcins in seven additional <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> species, encompassing phytopathogens and environmental isolates. We introduce three novel clades of microcins (MccW, MccX, and MccZ), while also identifying eight new variants of the five known class IIb microcins. To validate their antimicrobial potential, we heterologously expressed these microcins in <i>E. coli</i> and demonstrated efficacy against a variety of bacterial isolates, including plant pathogens from the genera <i>Brenneria</i>, <i>Gibbsiella,</i> and <i>Rahnella</i>. Two newly discovered microcins exhibit activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, <i>i.e., Acinetobacter baumannii</i> or <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> providing the first evidence that class IIb microcins can target bacteria outside of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family. This study underscores that class IIb microcin genes are more prevalent in the microbial world than previously recognized and that synthetic hybrid microcins can be a viable tool to target clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens. Our findings hold significant promise for the development of innovative engineered live biotherapeutic products tailored to combat these resilient bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94778">Hypersensitive intercellular responses of endometrial stromal cells drive invasion in Endometriosis</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis is a debilitating disease affecting 190 million women worldwide and the greatest single contributor to infertility. The most broadly accepted etiology is that uterine endometrial cells retrogradely enter the peritoneum during menses, implant and form invasive lesions in a process analogous to cancer metastasis. However, over 90% of women suffer retrograde menstruation, but only 10% develop endometriosis, and debate continues as to whether the underlying defect is endometrial or peritoneal. Processes implicated in invasion include: enhanced motility; adhesion to, and formation of gap junctions with, the target tissue. Endometrial stromal (ESCs) from 22 endometriosis patients at different disease stages show much greater invasiveness across mesothelial (or endothelial) monolayers than ESCs from 22 control subjects, which is further enhanced by the presence of EECs. This is due to enhanced responsiveness of endometriosis ESCs to the mesothelium, which induces migration and gap junction coupling. ESC-PMC gap junction coupling is shown to be required for invasion, while coupling between PMCs enhances mesothelial barrier breakdown.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99040">Recurrent disruption of tumour suppressor genes in cancer by somatic mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation signals</a></h4>

              
                The expression of eukaryotic genes relies on the precise 3'-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation of newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcripts. Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed somatic mutations affecting 3'UTR polyadenylation signals in human cancers using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, this work uncovers a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with significant potential to drive cancer progression.

">Frequency-specific theta states in the hippocampus modulate population activity with respect to behavioural context</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity reflects both external stimuli and the brain's internal state, which shapes how information is processed and perceived. An example of modulation of neural responses by network states is phase-precession in the hippocampus, where the phase of theta oscillations affects the firing of single neurons (place cells) and its relation to the external world. Here, we examine a different form of oscillation-to-neuron modulation, where frequency and power of the oscillation, instead of phase, modulate neural firing patterns at the population level. We refer to this as ensemble pattern modulation. To study this effect, we use electrophysiological recordings of rats performing an odour-memory (non-spatial) task. Using a data-driven model, we identified two distinct theta states: low-power-lower-theta (LPLT) and high-power-higher-theta (HPHT). Through decoding analyses, we found that these states differentially modulate hippocampal neural ensemble activity, in this case reflective of the trial outcome. This suggests that amplitude and frequency variations within theta oscillations may reconfigure neural firing at the network level to support distinct cognitive functions.

">Mapping neuropeptide sigaling in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are functionally diverse signaling molecules in the brain, regulating a wide range of basal bodily and cognitive processes. Despite their importance, the distribution and function of neuropeptides in the human brain remains underexplored. Here we comprehensively map the organization of human whole-brain neuropeptide receptors across multiple levels of description; from molecular and cellular embedding to mesoscale connectivity and macroscale cognitive specialization. Using gene transcription as a proxy, we reconstruct a topographic cortical and subcortical atlas of neuropeptide receptors for 38 neuropeptide receptors, across 14 different neuropeptide families. We find that most neuropeptide receptors are highly expressed either in cortex or subcortex, delineating an anatomical cortical-subcortical gradient. Neuropeptides preferentially co-localize with metabotropic neurotransmitters, suggesting a system-wide correspondence between slow-acting molecular signaling mechanisms. Mapping neuropeptide receptors and their cognate ligands onto white-matter connectomes, we demonstrate that specific neuropeptides families shape electrophysiological and haemodynamic inter-regional connectivity. To investigate the behavioural consequences of distributed neuropeptide systems, we apply meta-analytic decoding to neuropeptide maps and show a gradient of functions, from sensory-cognitive to reward and bodily functions. Finally, evolutionary analysis indicates extended positive selection for neuropeptides in early mammals, suggesting that refinement of neuropeptides coincides with the emergence of neocortex and higher cognitive function. Collectively, these results show that the neuropeptide receptors are highly organized across the human brain and closely intertwined with multiple features of brain structure and function.

">Sex-Specific Regulation of Behavioral Responses to Single Prolonged Stress: Role of PACAP</a></h4>

              
                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition in which a traumatic experience triggers symptoms related to re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal, and mood dysregulation. PTSD negatively impacts 6% of people during their lifetime, with women being disproportionally affected and exhibiting different, more severe symptoms than men. Despite this widespread impact, the molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD and its sex differences remain poorly understood. Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide which participates in fine-tuning circuitry throughout the brain and has been associated with PTSD in humans, especially in women. Here, we use Single Prolonged Stress (SPS), an animal model of PTSD, to explore the roles of PACAP and sex in PTSD-like behaviors. Specifically, a PACAP agonist or antagonist was infused into the infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, a region key to regulating fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, prior to SPS in male and female rats. One week later, rats were tested in open field/novel object, elevated plus maze, and social interaction. Utilizing a behavioral indexing method, we were able to uncover SPS effects in PTSD-related behavioral domains that were differentially impacted by PACAP manipulations in males and females. While both sexes exhibited increased threat avoidance and decreased threat assessment following SPS, females increased sociability while males decreased sociability. Males also appeared to be protected by IL PACAP antagonism while female SPS phenotypes were exacerbated by IL PACAP agonism. Furthermore, RNAscope revealed that PACAP in the prefrontal cortex responds differently to SPS in males and females. Together, these findings suggest complex relationships between SPS, sex, and IL PACAP which may have important implications for treating PTSD in men and women.

">Serotonin system development and adult function are regulated by GDNF</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive functions, neuropsychiatric disorders and behaviors from feeding to mood relate to the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system. We report that expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a known potent stimulator of the brain dopamine system, correlates with serotonergic markers in humans, and increased GDNF defines a subset of psychiatric patients with a characteristic 5-HT-related gene expression pattern. A similar [~]1.5- to 2-fold upregulation of endogenous GDNF expression in mice increases brain 5-HT levels and function, both developmentally and during adulthood, and modulates response to fluoxetine. Notably, increasing GDNF more than approximately 2-fold does not increase 5-HT further and instead produces an inverted U-shaped curve of 5-HT levels, suggesting why the GDNF/5-HT correlation has remained controversial. Collectively, our data indicate that GDNF levels fine-tune 5-HT system development and adult function while excess GDNF exclusively associates with neuropsychiatric illness, making it an important target for future research.

">Triggered Temptations: A New Procedure to Compare Reward-Seeking Behaviour Induced by Discriminative and Conditioned Stimuli in Rats</a></h4>

              
                RationaleEnvironmental cues guide animals towards resources vital for survival but can also drive maladaptive reward-seeking behaviours, as in gambling and eating disorders. While conditioned stimuli (CSs) are paired with reward delivery after reward-seeking actions, discriminative stimuli (DSs) signal reward availability independent of behaviour.

ObjectiveWe introduce a procedure to compare CS and DS effects on reward-seeking behaviour, in the same subjects within a single session.

MethodsFemale and male Sprague-Dawley rats learned to self-administer sucrose. During each session, DS+ trials signaled that lever pressing would produce sucrose paired with a CS+, and DS-trials signaled no sucrose and a CS-. Next, in the absence of sucrose, we assessed the ability of the cues to i) reinforce lever pressing and ii) increase sucrose seeking when presented response-independently. We also assessed the effects of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 and d-amphetamine on cue-induced sucrose seeking.

ResultsBy the end of self-administration training, lever pressing peaked during DS+ trials and dropped during DS-trials. The DS+ was a conditioned reinforcer of sucrose seeking in both sexes, whereas the CS+ was more effective in males. Response-independent presentations of the DS+ invigorated sucrose seeking in both sexes, whereas the CS+ was effective only in males. LY379268 suppressed DS+-triggered sucrose seeking in females, with no effect in males. D-amphetamine enhanced sucrose seeking non-specifically across cue conditions in males, with no effect in females.

ConclusionsOur new trial-based procedure can be used to identify unique and similar mechanisms underlying DS and CS influences on appetitive behaviour.
