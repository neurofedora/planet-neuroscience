              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/2/ENEURO.0114-24.2024?rss=1">Temporal Lobectomy Evidence for the Role of the Amygdala in Early Emotional Face and Body Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The amygdala is believed to make invaluable contributions to visual emotion processing. Yet how this subcortical body contributes to emotion perception across time is contended. Here, we measured differences in the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli after unilateral temporal lobe and amygdala resection (TLR) in humans, using EEG. Through mass univariate analysis of brain activity, we compared responses to fearful and neutral faces (left TLR <I>N</I> = 8, right TLR <I>N</I> = 8, control <I>N</I> = 8), and fearful and neutral bodies (left TLR <I>N</I> = 9, right TLR <I>N</I> = 9, control <I>N</I> = 9). We found that TLR impaired the early-stage perceptual processing of emotional stimuli seen in the control group. Indeed, in controls a heightened responses to fearful faces was found in the 140&ndash;170&nbsp;ms time window, over temporoparietal electrodes. This effect was also present in the left TLR group but disappeared in the right TLR group. For emotional bodies, brain activity was differentially sensitive to fearful stimuli at 90&ndash;120&nbsp;ms in the control group, but this effect was eliminated in both TLR groups. Collectively, these results reveal the amygdala contributes to the early stages of perceptual processing that discriminate emotional stimuli from neutral stimuli. Further, they emphasize the unique role of the right medial temporal structures such as the amygdala in emotional face perception.</p>

                <p>Axons in the mammalian brain show significant diversity in myelination motifs, displaying spatial heterogeneity in sheathing along individual axons and across brain regions. However, its impact on neural signaling and susceptibility to injury remains poorly understood. To address this, we leveraged cable theory and developed model axons replicating the myelin sheath distributions observed experimentally in different regions of the mouse central nervous system. We examined how the spatial arrangement of myelin affects propagation and predisposition to conduction failure in axons with cortical versus callosal myelination motifs. Our results indicate that regional differences in myelination significantly influence conduction timing and signaling reliability. Sensitivity of action potential propagation to the specific positioning, lengths, and ordering of myelinated and exposed segments reveals non-linear and path-dependent conduction. Furthermore, myelination motifs impact signaling vulnerability to demyelination, with callosal motifs being particularly sensitive to myelin changes. These findings highlight the crucial role of myelinating glia in brain function and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/2/ENEURO.0414-24.2025?rss=1">Neuronal Properties in the Lateral Habenula and Adult-Newborn Interactions in Virgin Female and Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The behavioral interactions between adults and newborns are decisive for the fitness and the survival of offspring across the animal kingdom. In laboratory mice, while virgin females display caregiving behaviors, virgin males are rather neglectful or aggressive toward pups. Despite the importance of these behavioral variations, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Brain regions encoding these behaviors may exhibit sex-dependent functional differences at the baseline. Additionally, these structures might undergo sex-specific plasticity after adults interact with the offspring. Emerging evidence suggests sex-based differences in input connectivity, genetics, and receptor expression of the epithalamic lateral habenula (LHb). Moreover, LHb neuronal activity is instrumental for adult&ndash;newborn interactions. However, whether LHb neuronal function varies between sexes and/or undergoes adaptations following interactions with pups has not been fully investigated. In this study, we used in vivo and ex vivo single-cell electrophysiology to examine the basal LHb neuronal activity of virgin female and male mice. In a second set of experiments, we exposed mice to pups and recapitulated sex-based divergent behaviors. Recordings in acute slices showed no alterations in LHb firing properties, regardless of sex or pup exposure. These findings suggest that, although the LHb participates in adult behaviors toward pups, this is not mediated by sex-dependent functional differences or adaptations in the neuronal firing properties. Thus, this study provides new insights into the neural basis of sex-specific adult&ndash;newborn behaviors and the role of the LHb in these processes.</p>

                Background This study investigated the relationship between preferred bubble speeds in sensory room bubble tubes and physiological–psychological factors, including interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time perception, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels. Methods A sample of 50 participants engaged in a controlled experiment in which they used the method of adjustment to determine their preferred speed of a bubble tube simulated by an upward-moving Random Dot Motion (RDM) stimulus. Subjective time perception was evaluated through a time estimation task in which participants estimated a 60-second interval, and interoceptive sensitivity was measured via a heartbeat-tracking task. Participants’ visual discomfort and anxiety levels were assessed using the Visual Discomfort Scale Japanese Version (VDS-J), Trypophobia Questionnaire Japanese Version (TQ-J), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results The results from the method of adjustment indicated that the preferred speed varied largely, from 1.09 to 13.86 degrees per second. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that higher interoceptive awareness correlated with a preference for slower speeds, whereas higher anxiety levels correlated with a preference for faster speeds. In addition, our multiple regression analysis showed that subjective time perception accuracy and visual discomfort levels were significant predictors of the participants’ preferred RDM speeds in the regression model. Conclusion The results indicate that interoceptive sensitivity, subjective time, visual discomfort, and anxiety levels play significant roles in determining the preferred speeds for RDM stimulation. Our results highlight the importance of considering individual differences in physiological and psychological states when designing therapeutic sensory environments such as sensory rooms and bubble tubes to enhance well-being and therapeutic outcomes.

                Background The Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization, has played a significant role in shaping the American judiciary for decades. Despite its influence, comprehensive empirical data on the organization remains scarce. We address this gap by systematically documenting 20,205 public events hosted by the Society from 1984 to 2024, with substantive coverage from 2007 onward. Methods Following ethical best practices in data collection and ownership, we gathered event metadata—including titles, dates, locations, sponsors, topics, and speakers—via web scraping from the Federalist Society’s archives. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of event trends, co-speaking networks, and thematic shifts over time. To ensure data integrity, we performed validation, deduplication, and cleaning, resulting in a well-structured, high-quality dataset. Conclusions This dataset provides an empirical foundation for examining the Federalist Society’s role in legal discourse. It is a resource for scholars in law, political science, sociology, gender studies, network science, and computational social science, enabling investigations into key themes of discussion, event participation patterns, demographic diversity, professional backgrounds, and more. Researchers can use it to study institutional influence, legal networks, and the evolution of conservative legal thought.

                Background This study investigates factors influencing the deposit of academic publications and research data in open access repositories by Spanish researchers. Methods Using survey data from a sample of Spanish academics, the research examines the impact of personal attributes (e.g., gender, age, knowledge of open science) and contextual variables (e.g., academic discipline, institutional type) on deposit behaviours. Quantitative methods, including chi-square tests and regression analysis, reveal significant associations between knowledge of open science and deposit practices. Results Researchers familiar with open science principles were more likely to deposit multiple versions of articles and datasets, albeit with varying intensity. Key findings highlight disciplinary and institutional differences: researchers in Life Sciences and Experimental Sciences showed higher engagement with both article and data deposits, whereas Health Sciences lagged. Gender differences were also observed, with male researchers depositing articles and datasets more frequently than their female counterparts, though age showed limited impact. Public institutions exhibited lower data deposit rates despite mandates supporting open access. Conclusions The study underscores the need for tailored policies, including awareness campaigns, infrastructure investment, and discipline-specific strategies, to promote equitable and widespread adoption of open science practices. Findings contribute to understanding open science implementation, emphasizing the interplay of individual, institutional, and systemic factors.

                We developed a new time-calibrated phylogenetic tree incorporating primarily endemic Ryukyu Islands cicada data, along with some cryptic species, following the recent global cicada studies by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021). A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1.10.4 software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations dating as far back as the Triassic were adopted, largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), with a Quaternary geological event calibration based on Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b), which was input into BEAST v1.10.4. In the COI tree, the crown age of Cicadoidea was estimated at 200.63 Ma. Tettigarctidae was found to be the oldest lineage, sister to all remaining cicadas. Derotettiginae, at 99.2 Ma, is the next oldest lineage, sister to all other monophyletic cicadas. The Tibicininae clade branched at 66.15 Ma, with the subfamilies Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae diverging at a crown age of 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of many tribe and genus-specific clades, with numerous cryptic species emerging due to vicariance and adaptive radiation. We estimated the base substitution rate as a function of age, and the results strongly indicate an exponential increase in substitution rates during recent geological time. This increase in cicada biodiversity, including the generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surrounding regions, may have been driven by the spread of C4 grasses and concurrent Quaternary climate changes.

                Background Musculoskeletal disorders comprise injuries that limit the ability of the human body to move and include elements such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They are considered significant problems within the practice of clinical dentistry, arising mainly because of physical overload resulting from dynamic and static activities. The aim of the research was to evaluate the relationship between shoulder, arm, and hand disability and body mass index in dentists. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental and correlational design. The sample consisted of 222 private practice´s dentists. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. A questionnaire was considered to collect demographic, occupational, anthropometric, and exercise data. To assess the presence of symptoms of functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand, the shortened Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scale (QuickDASH) was used. Results There are differences in shoulder, arm, and hand disability scores among the body mass index classification groups (PR=12.74, 95% CI [9.08; 16.4], p<0.001), even after adjusting for occupational and physical activity variables (PR=10544.08, 95% CI [302.84; 367111.40], p<0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the significant relationship between BMI and functional disability of the shoulder, arm, and hand in dental surgeons, emphasizing the need for preventive strategies focused on weight management and the promotion of physical activity.

Biological and dynamic mechanisms by which Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells contribute to the development of acquired drug resistance have not been fully elucidated. Here, by integrating multidimensional data from drug-treated PC9 cells, we developed a novel multiscale mathematical model from an evolutionary perspective that encompasses epigenetic and cellular population dynamics. By coupling stochastic simulation with quantitative analysis, we identified epigenetic instability as the most prominent kinetic feature related to the emergence of DTP cell subpopulations and the effectiveness of intermittent treatment. Moreover, we revealed the optimal schedule for intermittent treatment, including the optimal area for therapeutic time and drug holidays. By leveraging single-cell RNA-seq data characterizing the drug tolerance of lung cancer, we validated the predictions made by our model and further revealed previously unrecognized biological features of DTP cells, such as cell autophagy and migration, as well as new biomarker genes of therapeutic tolerance. Our work not only provides a paradigm for the integration of multiscale mathematical models with newly emerging genomics data but also improves our understanding of the crucial roles of DTP cells and offers guidance for developing new intermittent treatment strategies against acquired drug resistance in cancer.

Research lab groups are hotspots for the education of the next generation of scientists, and making these units work as creatively as possible is essential for solving pressing issues in biology, the environment, and beyond. This article highlights 10 points that can help make labs as creative as possible. Several of these points are about setting up a creative lab culture; others are about fostering group-level creative output, some are more about encouraging creativity of individual team members, or both. While the head of a research group, the principal investigator, plays an important role, this can only be successful in healthy labs where everyone contributes.

                <p>by Wenxuan Li, Xu Chen, Suli Liu, Chiyu Zhang, Guyue Liu</p>

With the ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its increasing adaptation to humans, several variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have been identified since late 2020. These include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron parent lineage, and other variants. These variants may show distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, which require specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model and reported infected data of variants with physical information neural networks (PINNs) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network (VOCs-INN). In our experiments, we found that this algorithm can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia (BC) province and its five internal health agencies in Canada. Furthermore, it can simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across these regions. VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

                <p>by Christina Y. Lee, Sina Bonakdar, Kelly B. Arnold</p>

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition characterized by a shift in vaginal microbiome composition that is linked to negative reproductive outcomes and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections. Despite the commonality of BV, standard-of-care antibiotics provide limited control of recurrent BV episodes and development of new biotherapies is limited by the lack of controlled models needed to evaluate new dosing and treatment regimens. Here, we develop an <i>in silico</i> framework to evaluate selection criteria for potential probiotic strains, test adjunctive therapy with antibiotics, and alternative dosing strategies. This computational framework highlighted the importance of resident microbial species on the efficacy of hypothetical probiotic strains, identifying specific interaction parameters between resident non-optimal anaerobic bacteria (nAB) and <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. with candidate probiotic strains as a necessary selection criterion. Model predictions were able to replicate results from a recent phase 2b clinical trial for the live biotherapeutic product, Lactin-V, demonstrating the relevance of the <i>in silico</i> platform. Results from the computational model support that the probiotic strain in Lactin-V requires adjunctive antibiotic therapy to be effective, and that increasing the dosing frequency of the probiotic could have a moderate impact on BV recurrence at 12 and 24 weeks. Altogether, this framework could provide evidence for the rational selection of probiotic strains and help optimize dosing frequency or adjunctive therapies.

                Background Hybrid nanofluids, consisting of two distinct nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid, are widely used in industries requiring enhanced heat and mass transfer, such as cooling systems and heat exchangers. These fluids improve thermal conductivity and fluid dynamics, leading to better heat management and energy efficiency. This study investigates the combined effects of non-linear thermal radiation, Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes, and other factors on the three-dimensional flow, heat, and mass transfer of a Williamson hybrid nanofluid. The flow occurs over a stretching porous sheet subjected to an external magnetic field, Joule heating, chemical reactions, and heat generation. Methods Copper (Cu) and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles are suspended in ethylene glycol (C₂C₆O₂) to form the hybrid nanofluid. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically with MATLAB’s bvp4c solver. The study examines various parameters, including stretching ratio, nanoparticle volume fraction, and relaxation times for concentration and thermal effects. Results are validated against existing literature. Results The findings reveal that a higher stretching ratio reduces velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, while also lowering skin friction and secondary velocity. Increasing nanoparticle volume fraction decreases velocity and temperature profiles but enhances skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers. Concentration profiles decline with higher concentration relaxation time, while temperature increases with longer thermal relaxation time. Conclusions In conclusion, Cu−Al₂O₃/C₂C₆O₂ hybrid nanofluids demonstrate superior heat and mass transfer capabilities compared to mono-nanofluids. The performance is significantly influenced by parameters such as nanoparticle volume fraction, relaxation times, and the stretching ratio, providing valuable insights for heat and mass transfer applications.

                Background Increased awareness of sustainability has renewed academic interest in understanding perception. The objective was to determine the expected behavior among university students concerning air quality mitigation. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework to understand students’ attitudes toward air quality mitigation along with subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Method This study uses the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to provide an understanding of current studies regarding the aspect of air quality and behavior from databases reviewed by experts. The research highlights the gap in the current study area and provides a need for more detailed empirical research. Result The study reviewed 24 articles and proposed a conceptual model based on the TPB framework to understand the means of air quality mitigation behaviors in a campus environment. Conclusion This model aims to guide future research to improve air quality in higher education institutions. The findings also focuses on theoretical contributions by applying TPB.

                Background This research aims to study the factors affecting the fund performance management (FPM) of the Local Health Security Fund Committee of the Sisaket Local Health Insurance Fund Committee. Methods Data from 324 participants were collected using Descriptive and Inferential Statistics created between October 3, 2022, and February 15, 2023, to determine the factors for predicting the FPM of the Local Health Security Fund Committee of the Sisaket Local Health Insurance Fund Committee. Results Using a stepwise multi-regressive analysis, the results showed three variables: organizational support, supporting factors, and being a board member and secretary. They were able to explain the variations in factors affecting the FPM of the Sisaket Local Health Security Fund Committee by 49.87% (R2=0.498, R2 adj=0.493, SEest=2.50355, F= 105.637, p<0.001) respectively. Conclusion Disbursing the budget to solve problems in the area effectively will be the best benefit of the local participants in the area.

                Background Awareness of COS development and use among Chinese researchers has increased since the concept was introduced in China in 2012. An increasing number of COS have been registered and completed by Chinese developers. The status of relevant COS research led by Chinese researchers and their quality remains unclear. Methods An electronic search will be conducted in the COMET, ChiCOS, and Chinese literature databases (CNKI, WanFang, and SinoMed). According to different study types (registration entry, protocol, or completed research), the information of the included studies will be extracted into different Excel tables. The extracted information depends on the type of study. The findings of the review will be presented descriptively. For protocol, we will check the quality with COS-STAP. For completed research, we will check the quality with COS-STAR and COS-STAD. In addition, we will conduct a comparative analysis to determine how many entries in the ChiCOS database have not been registered in the COMET database. Discussion This study will provide valuable insights into the current state of COS in China. This is essential for a better understanding of the barriers and facilitators to COS development and application. Study registration This research is registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness: https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/3277.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early protein malnutrition has been shown to affect the brain reward circuitry, leading to enduring molecular, neurochemical, and behavioral alterations. This study explored how maternal protein restriction contributes to anhedonia, a key depression symptom, focusing on the hippocampal BDNF–TrkB signaling and structural plasticity changes in the CA1 subregion of the dorsal hippocampus (DH). To achieve our goal, adult rats submitted to a protein restriction schedule from the 14th day of gestation up to 30 days of age (PR-rats) were subjected to the sucrose preference test (SPT) and compared with animals fed a normoprotein diet. Immediately after SPT, we assessed the levels of BDNF and its receptor TrkB and structural plasticity changes. Interestingly, PR-rats showed a significant decrease in sucrose preference. Furthermore, perinatal protein-restriction-induced anhedonia correlated with decreased BDNF and p-TrkB levels in the DH, alongside reduced dendritic spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons, particularly mature spines (i.e., stubby and mushroom spines). These findings suggest that decreased hippocampal BDNF–TrkB signaling accompanied by structural remodeling in the CA1 pyramidal neurons may contribute to the reduced ability of undernourished animals to respond to rewarding stimuli, increasing their vulnerability to anhedonia later in life.</p>

                The multi-omics study of cocaine-use disorder (CUD) in postmortem human brain by Zillich et al. provides an in-depth molecular characterization of the ventral striatum in CUD by integrating microRNA-seq, RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, and proteomic datasets. Their study highlights metabolic and glutamatergic signaling changes as a molecular hallmark of CUD.

                Palchaudhuri et al. show that the posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) codes for aversive footshocks (US) both with onset and offset responses; the US-offset information is selectively transmitted at the pInsCx-to-anterior-LA connection. US-driven activity in this pathway, however, is not necessary for fear learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100394">Specific presynaptic functions require distinct Drosophila Cav2 splice isoforms</a></h4>

              
                At many vertebrate synapses, presynaptic functions are tuned by expression of different Ca<sub>v</sub>2 channels. Most invertebrate genomes contain only one <i>Ca<sub>v</sub>2</i> gene. The <i>Drosophila</i> Ca<sub>v</sub>2 homolog, cacophony (cac), induces synaptic vesicle release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). We hypothesize that <i>Drosophila</i> cac functional diversity is enhanced by two mutually exclusive exon pairs that are not conserved in vertebrates, one in the voltage sensor and one in the loop binding Ca<sub>β</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits. We find that alternative splicing in the voltage sensor affects channel activation voltage. Only the isoform with the higher activation voltage localizes to AZs at the glutamatergic <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junction and is imperative for normal synapse function. By contrast, alternative splicing at the other alternative exon pair tunes multiple aspects of presynaptic function. While expression of one exon yields normal transmission, expression of the other reduces channel number in the AZ and thus release probability. This also abolishes presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Moreover, reduced channel number affects short-term plasticity, which is rescued by increasing the external calcium concentration to match release probability to control. In sum, in <i>Drosophila</i> alternative splicing provides a mechanism to regulate different aspects of presynaptic functions with only one <i>Ca<sub>v</sub>2</i> gene.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99971">fmo-4 promotes longevity and stress resistance via ER to mitochondria calcium regulation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are a conserved family of xenobiotic enzymes upregulated in multiple longevity interventions, including nematode and mouse models. Previous work supports that <i>C. elegans fmo-2</i> promotes longevity, stress resistance, and healthspan by rewiring endogenous metabolism. However, there are five <i>C. elegans</i> FMOs and five mammalian FMOs, and it is not known whether promoting longevity and health benefits is a conserved role of this gene family. Here, we report that expression of <i>C. elegans fmo-4</i> promotes lifespan extension and paraquat stress resistance downstream of both dietary restriction and inhibition of mTOR. We find that overexpression of <i>fmo-4</i> in just the hypodermis is sufficient for these benefits, and that this expression significantly modifies the transcriptome. By analyzing changes in gene expression, we find that genes related to calcium signaling are significantly altered downstream of <i>fmo-4</i> expression. Highlighting the importance of calcium homeostasis in this pathway, <i>fmo-4</i> overexpressing animals are sensitive to thapsigargin, an ER stressor that inhibits calcium flux from the cytosol to the ER lumen. This calcium/<i>fmo-4</i> interaction is solidified by data showing that modulating intracellular calcium with either small molecules or genetics can change expression of <i>fmo-4</i> and/or interact with <i>fmo-4</i> to affect lifespan and stress resistance. Further analysis supports a pathway where <i>fmo-4</i> modulates calcium homeostasis downstream of activating transcription factor-6 (<i>atf-6</i>), whose knockdown induces and requires <i>fmo-4</i> expression. Together, our data identify <i>fmo-4</i> as a longevity-promoting gene whose actions interact with known longevity pathways and calcium homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100820">T3SS translocon induces pyroptosis by direct interaction with NLRC4/NAIP inflammasome</a></h4>

              
                Type III secretion system (T3SS) is a virulence apparatus existing in many bacterial pathogens. Structurally, T3SS consists of the base, needle, tip, and translocon. The NLRC4 inflammasome is the major receptor for T3SS needle and basal rod proteins. Whether other T3SS components are recognized by NLRC4 is unclear. In this study, using <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> as a model intracellular pathogen, we examined T3SS−inflammasome interaction and its effect on cell death. <i>E. tarda</i> induced pyroptosis in a manner that required the bacterial translocon and the host inflammasome proteins of NLRC4, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1/4. The translocon protein EseB triggered NLRC4/NAIP-mediated pyroptosis by binding NAIP via its C-terminal region, particularly the terminal 6 residues (T6R). EseB homologs exist widely in T3SS-positive bacteria and share high identities in T6R. Like <i>E. tarda</i> EseB, all of the representatives of the EseB homologs exhibited T6R-dependent NLRC4 activation ability. Together these results revealed the function and molecular mechanism of EseB to induce host cell pyroptosis and suggested a highly conserved inflammasome-activation mechanism of T3SS translocon in bacterial pathogens.

                <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites are inoculated into the skin during the bite of an infected mosquito. This motile stage invades cutaneous blood vessels to reach the liver and infect hepatocytes. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on the sporozoite surface is an important antigen targeted by protective antibodies (Abs) in immunoprophylaxis or elicited by vaccination. Antibody-mediated protection mainly unfolds during parasite skin migration, but rare and potent protective Abs additionally neutralize sporozoite in the liver. Here, using a rodent malaria model, microscopy and bioluminescence imaging, we show a late-neutralizing effect of 3D11 anti-CSP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the liver. The need for several hours to eliminate parasites in the liver was associated with an accumulation of 3D11 effects, starting with the inhibition of sporozoite motility, sinusoidal extravasation, cell invasion, and terminating with the parasite killing inside the invaded cell. This late-neutralizing activity could be helpful to identify more potent therapeutic mAbs with stronger activity in the liver.

                Sleep loss increases AMPA-synaptic strength and number in the neocortex. However, this is only part of the synaptic sleep loss response. We report an increased AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio in frontal-cortical pyramidal neurons of layers 2–3. Silent synapses are absent, decreasing the plastic potential to convert silent NMDA to active AMPA synapses. These sleep loss changes are recovered by sleep. Sleep genes are enriched for synaptic shaping cellular components controlling glutamate synapse phenotype, overlap with autism risk genes, and are primarily observed in excitatory pyramidal neurons projecting intra-telencephalically. These genes are enriched with genes controlled by the transcription factor, MEF2c, and its repressor, HDAC4. Sleep genes can thus provide a framework within which motor learning and training occur mediated by the sleep-dependent oscillation of glutamate-synaptic phenotypes.

                Understanding neuronal connectivity at single-cell resolution remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, with current methods particularly limited in mapping long-distance circuits and preserving cell type information. Here we present Connectome-seq, a high-throughput method that combines engineered synaptic proteins, RNA barcoding, and parallel single-nucleus and single-synaptosome sequencing to map neuronal connectivity at single-synapse resolution. This AAV-based approach enables simultaneous capture of both synaptic connections and molecular identities of connected neurons. We validated this approach in the mouse pontocerebellar circuit, identifying both established projections and potentially novel synaptic partnerships. Through integrated analysis of connectivity and gene expression, we identified molecular markers enriched in connected neurons, suggesting potential determinants of circuit organization. By enabling systematic mapping of neuronal connectivity across brain regions with single-cell precision and gene expression information, Connectome-seq provides a scalable platform for comprehensive circuit analysis across different experimental conditions and biological states. This advance in connectivity mapping methodology opens new possibilities for understanding circuit organization in complex mammalian brains.

">Neurons in auditory cortex integrate information within constrained temporal windows that are invariant to the stimulus context and information rate</a></h4>

              
                Much remains unknown about the computations that allow animals to flexibly integrate across multiple timescales in natural sounds. One key question is whether multiscale integration is accomplished by diverse populations of neurons, each of which integrates information within a constrained temporal window, or whether individual units effectively integrate across many different temporal scales depending on the information rate. Here, we show that responses from neurons throughout the ferret auditory cortex are nearly completely unaffected by sounds falling beyond a time-limited "integration window". This window varies substantially across cells within the auditory cortex (~15 to ~150 ms), increasing substantially from primary to non-primary auditory cortex across all cortical layers, but is unaffected by the information rate of sound. These results indicate that multiscale computation is predominantly accomplished by diverse and hierarchically organized neural populations, each of which integrates information within a highly constrained temporal window.

">A Clinically Aligned Murine Model of Electroconvulsive Stimulation Reverses Social Aversion and Displays Fear Memory Impairment After Chronic Social Defeat Stress</a></h4>

              
                Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment for patients with major depression, bipolar depression, mania, catatonia, and severe psychosis. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ECT largely remain unknown. While previous preclinical studies have noted a role for neurotropic signaling, neurogenesis, and alterations in monoamine neurotransmitter systems, these models were largely conducted using procedures that deviate from clinical practice. Therefore, we sought to develop a clinically relevant murine model of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), a model of ECT, which more closely replicates current clinical approaches and then employ this model to explore ECS mechanisms. Using the well-established chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm, known to disrupt reward and motivated behaviors, we investigated whether the behavioral changes after CSDS could be reversed following a clinically related course of ECS. Additionally, we observed induction of plasticity-related genes in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala, regions responsible for reward- and fear-related memory, respectively. Lastly, we investigated ECS-related changes in the NAcc with RNA-sequencing. This approach revealed a gene expression profile associated with ECS-related changes in NAcc. Pathway analysis demonstrated cellular changes primarily involved in regulating cell migration and differentiation. Therefore, utilizing our novel and clinically relevant model of ECS, we have begun to elucidate mechanisms that contribute to ECTs therapeutic outcomes by examining murine behavior and RNA from brain regions associated with stress-induced states that model anxiety and depression and the impact of ECS.

">Genetic targeting of astrocytes associated with specific neuronal circuit in adult Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are the major glial population of the brain and have been associated with a vast number of functions. To probe this diversity and to reach a similar level of understanding about astrocyte physiology that we have about neurons, we need genetic tools to target specific astrocytic subpopulations. In Drosophila, we are restricted to using driver lines that drive expression in astrocytes throughout the brain. To target specific astrocytes, we have optimized the genetic tool TRACT (and refer to it as astro-TRACT), allowing effector expression specifically in local astrocytes of a given neuronal circuit. We analyzed specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the tool across various MB split-Gal4 drivers. We found that the number of pre-synapses correlates positively with the success of the tool. Applying the tool to characterize morphology of individual astrocytes revealed that local astrocytes around MB medial compartments project into the ellipsoid body. Astro-TRACT will be a valuable resource to investigate both mechanistic astrocyte-neuron signaling and functional and structural astrocytic diversity across the adult Drosophila brain.

">EEG Microstates reveal distinct network dynamics in lucid and non-lucid REM sleep</a></h4>

              
                During lucid dreaming, the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. In past years, numerous studies have explored the characteristics of lucid dreams, which link lucid dreams to vivid visual perception, positive emotions, and wake-like metacognition and executive functions. To determine brain network activity associated with the conscious experience during lucid dreaming, we analyzed 39 sleep recordings (non-lucid REM vs. lucid REM) with 32-channel polysomnography from 8 lucid dreamers, using EEG microstate analysis. We found that microstates A and G dominated during lucid REM sleep compared to non-lucid REM sleep, and microstates B, C, and D dominated during non-lucid REM sleep compared to lucid REM sleep. We explored the correlation of our microstate maps with previous findings based on topographical similarities of the microstate maps in our study. This suggests that in our study, microstate A might be associated with emotional processing, microstate B with visual processing, microstate C with salience network activity, microstate D with executive functions, and microstate G with the default mode network. Our results suggest that lucidity during REM sleep is associated with increased self-visualization, metacognition, and executive processing, along with decreased emotional processing and reduced default mode network activity. Additionally, we found the inverse relationship between the presence of microstates/networks associated with regions that serve specific functions and evidence for the function being used. This might indicate the inhibitory function of the EEG microstates during sleep. Our study provides novel insight into the distinct network dynamics in lucid and non-Lucid REM sleep.

">Nitrous oxide modulates cortical activity, wake-sleep oscillations, and produces antidepressant-like effects in mice</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that nitrous oxide (N2O), a gaseous NMDA receptor antagonist and dissociative anesthetic, exerts rapid antidepressant effects akin to subanesthetic ketamine. However, its cellular, molecular, and behavioral effects remain poorly understood. Using in vivo two-photon imaging through cortical microprisms, we demonstrate that 50% N2O/O2 rapidly increases neuronal calcium activity in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This was corroborated by elevated c-Fos expression at both protein and mRNA levels in mPFC lysates. Cortical EEG recordings revealed that N2O increased subsequent wake-associated gamma oscillations and enhanced slow-wave activity during sleep, suggestive of cortical activation and synaptic potentiation. In a chronic corticosterone stress model, N2O elicited antidepressant-like behavioral effects in several, though not all, domains. Together, these findings indicate that a single treatment with N2O rapidly enhances cortical activity, modulates sleep and wake EEG oscillations, and produces antidepressant-like effects, paralleling key actions associated with subanesthetic ketamine.

">Implicit Emotional Biases in Anxiety and Depression: A Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation Study</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and depression are among the leading global causes of disability, yet their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Traditional event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown attentional biases in anxiety and blunted responses to positive stimuli in depression, but limitations in sensitivity and interpretability hinder their clinical application. Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) offers an objective, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approach to measuring neural responses to emotional stimuli. In this study, we applied FPVS with affective images to assess differences in emotional processing between individuals with anxiety and healthy controls across two experimental phases, optimizing stimulus presentation parameters. The results revealed that individuals with anxiety exhibited increased neural responses to negative stimuli compared to positive stimuli, as well as reduced responses to high-arousal stimuli, particularly in occipito-temporal and central-parietal regions. Additionally, individuals with comorbid depression showed blunted responses to high-arousal stimuli across multiple brain regions, consistent with reduced emotional reactivity. These findings support the feasibility of FPVS as a rapid and reliable tool for assessing emotional processing differences in clinical populations, with potential applications in translational research and psychiatric screening.

">Magnetoencephalography Reveals Neuroprotective Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination in Non-Human Primates</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can lead to widespread neurological complications, including cognitive deficits and neurodegenerative symptoms, even in the absence of significant structural brain abnormalities. The potential neuroprotective effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remain underexplored. Here, we demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of a psoralen-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a non-human primate model using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG), a non-invasive neurophysiological recording technique with sub-millisecond temporal and submillimeter spatial resolution. MEG scans demonstrated substantial preservation of neural activity across multiple brain regions in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls following viral challenge. This approach not only underscores the role of vaccination in mitigating severe neurological outcomes but also highlights the capability of MEG to detect subtle yet significant changes in brain function that may be overlooked by other imaging modalities. These findings advance our understanding of vaccine-induced neuroprotection and establish MEG as a powerful tool for monitoring brain function in the context of viral infections.

">TGIF2 is a major regulator of neural stem cell fate and neurogenic priming</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, neural stem cells (NSCs) must balance self-renewal with differentiation and ensure lineage progression. To identify novel regulators of NSCs during neurogenesis, we isolated NSCs by FACS from the mouse cerebral cortex and ganglionic eminence at mid-neurogenesis, and at birth, when gliogenesis starts in both, but neurogenesis only continues in the latter region. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed major transcriptional and chromatin changes between these stages and identified TGFB-Induced Homeobox Factor 2 (TGIF2) as a key candidate factor in neurogenic NSCs. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated a potent role of TGIF2 controlling NSC fate maintenance mediated by its interaction with the SIN3A/HDAC repressor complex suppressing neuronal differentiation genes. Multiomic comparison of NSC and neuron gene expression allowed the comprehensive analysis of neurogenic priming in cortical NSCs, identifying TGIF2 as its major regulator by restraining neuronal differentiation gene activation in NSCs.

">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Reduces Non-Decision Time in Perceptual Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decision-making enables humans to process sensory information and translate it into goal-directed actions. A critical component of this process is response time, which declines with age due to the slowing of both non-decision processes and evidence accumulation. While perceptual learning has been shown to counteract these declines, it remains unclear whether non-decision processes can be accelerated through direct neural stimulation, bypassing the need for long training sessions. Here, we propose that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can enhance perceptual decision-making by specifically reducing non-decision time. To test this hypothesis, we tracked response times during a perceptual learning task while recording brain activity. Using the Drift Diffusion Model, we quantified the effects of TMS on mental speed and non-decision time. Our findings reveal that perceptual learning decreases response time by simultaneously increasing mental speed and reducing non-decision time. Crucially, TMS application to brain regions associated with perceptual learning further shortened non-decision time without altering mental speed. These results demonstrate that TMS can selectively accelerate non-decision processes, offering a promising intervention for mitigating age-related cognitive slowing and enhancing decision efficiency.

                Neuroscience emerged as a distinct academic discipline during the 20th century and has undergone rapid expansion since then. However, a comprehensive analysis of its evolving landscape remains lacking. The present study provides a large-scale, data-driven, mapping of neuroscience research. Leveraging large language models and clustering techniques to analyze 461,316 articles published between 1999 and 2023, this study reveals the field's structural organization and highlights dominant themes. Citation network analysis uncovers a surprisingly integrated picture and key intellectual hubs that shape the broader research landscape. An analysis of how research clusters align with pre-defined dimensions demonstrates a strong experimental focus, widespread reliance on micro theories, and a growing emphasis on applied and translational research. At the same time, fundamental research is at the risk of decline while theoretical work and cross-scale integration remain limited. This study provides a framework for understanding neuroscience's trajectory and identifies potential avenues for strengthening the field.

">Dual process impairments in reinforcement learning and working memory systems underlie learning deficits in physiological anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety has been robustly linked to deficits in frontal executive function including working memory (WM) and attentional control processes. However, although anxiety has also been associated with impaired performance on learning tasks, computational investigations of reinforcement learning (RL) impairment in anxiety have yielded mixed results. WM processes are known to contribute to learning behavior in parallel to RL processes and to modulate the effective learning rate as a function of load. However, WM processes have typically not been modeled in investigations of anxiety and RL. In the current study, we leveraged an experimental paradigm (RLWM) which manipulates the relative contributions of WM and RL processes in a reinforcement learning and retention task using multiple stimulus set sizes. Using a computational model of interactive RL and WM processes, we investigated whether individual differences in physiological or cognitive anxiety impacted task performance via deficits in RL or WM.  Elevated physiological, but not cognitive, anxiety scores were strongly associated with worse performance during learning and retention testing across all set sizes. Computationally, higher physiological anxiety scores were significantly related to reduced learning rate and increased rate of WM decay. To highlight the importance of modeling WM contributions to learning, we considered the effect of fitting RL models without WM modules to the data. Here we found that reduced learning performance for higher physiological anxiety was at least partially misattributed to stochastic decision noise in 9 out of 10 RL-only models considered. These findings reveal a dual-process impairment in learning in anxiety that is linked to a more physiological than cognitive anxiety phenotype. More broadly, this work also points to the importance of accounting for the contribution of WM to RL when investigating psychopathology-related deficits in learning.

">Deep generation of personalized connectomes based on individual attributes</a></h4>

              
                An individual's connectome is unique. Interindividual variation in connectome architecture associates with disease status, cognition, lifestyle factors, and other personal attributes. While models to predict personal attributes from a person's connectome are abundant, the inverse task-inferring connectome architecture from an individual's personal profile-has not been widely studied. Here, we introduce a deep model to generate a person's entire connectome exclusively based on their age, sex, body phenotypes, cognition, and lifestyle factors. Using the richly phenotyped UK Biobank connectome cohort (N=8,086), we demonstrate that our model can generate network architectures that closely recapitulate connectomes mapped empirically using diffusion MRI and tractography. We find that age, sex, and body phenotypes exert the strongest influence on the connectome generation process, with an impact approximately four times greater than that of cognition and lifestyle factors. Regional differences in the importance of measures were observed, including an increased importance of cognition in the association cortex relative to the visual system. We further show that generated connectomes can improve the training of machine learning models and reduce their predictive errors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inferring brain connectivity from an individual's personal data and enables future applications of connectome generation such as data augmentation and anonymous data sharing.

                Here we present the FHIRM-TPM 3.0, a 2.6 g miniature two-photon microscope capable of multicolor deep-brain imaging in freely behaving mice. The system was integrated with a broadband anti-resonant hollow-core fiber featuring low transmission loss, minimal dispersion from 700-1060 nm, and high tolerance of laser power. By correcting chromatic and spherical aberrations and optimizing the fluorescence collection aperture, we achieved cortical neuronal imaging at depths exceeding 820 m and, using a GRIN lens, hippocampal Ca2+ imaging at single dendritic spine resolution. Moreover, we engineered three interchangeable parfocal objectives, allowing for a tenfold scalable field-of-view up to 1x0.8 mm2, with lateral resolutions ranging from 0.68 to 1.46 m. By multicolor imaging at excitation wavelengths of 780 nm, 920 nm and 1030 nm, we investigated mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ activities relative to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the cortex of awake APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Thus, the FHIRM-TPM 3.0 provides a versatile imaging system suitable for diverse brain imaging scenarios.

">A zebrafish circuit for behavioral credit assignment</a></h4>

              
                An important question in systems neuroscience is how the brain links choices and their outcomes to modify future behavior. Despite being a fundamental computation, we lack explicit circuit-level models of how this is achieved. Here, we provide evidence for a cellular substrate underlying this computation in a vertebrate brain. We develop an operant thermoregulatory assay in larval zebrafish, and show that adaptive responses depend on the precise temporal coincidence between choices and contingent thermal feedback. Chemogenetic ablations reveal that the dorsal habenula (dHb), the homolog of the mammalian medial habenula, plays an essential role in this adaptive behavior. Functional and anatomical mapping of the downstream circuitry reveals that the intermediate interpeduncular nucleus (iIPN) integrates choice- and temperature-related signals, conveyed by the dHb and a prepontine hindbrain nucleus, respectively. While dHb axons exhibit a diffuse connectivity pattern, hindbrain neurons project onto specific, lateralized iIPN regions. We show that these iIPN glomeruli function as sensorimotor detectors, integrating choices and outcomes. Specifically, when a swim in a given direction is closely followed by a temperature change, iIPN activity shows increased responses. We further show that this coincidence detection, with a precise temporal profile, links an action to its subsequent sensory feedback, relies on a presynaptic mechanism within the terminal segments of dHb axons. This mechanism is mediated by GABAB-dependent modulation of dHb sensory axons by choice-related prepontine GABAergic neurons. In this study we are therefore able to link an adaptive behavior to aspecific circuit mechanism.

">Transcriptomic analysis of C9orf72-mutated iPSC-derived microglia implicates cell-autonomous upregulation of selected NLRP3 inflammasome genes in motor neuron degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the non-coding region of the gene C9orf72 is the most prevalent mutation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. The C9orf72 HRE contributes to motor neuron degeneration in ALS both through cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous disease processes involving glial cells such as microglia. The molecular mechanisms by which C9orf72 HRE microglia contribute to motor neuron death in ALS remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we generated microglia from human C9orf72 HRE and isogenic iPSCs using three different microglia derivation methods that can generate microglia with distinct intrinsic inflammatory profiles. RNA sequencing analysis reveals a consistent dysregulation of specific genes involved in pathways underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation in C9orf72 HRE microglia independent of priming with any activating cues. In agreement with elevated expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, conditioned media from C9orf72 HRE microglia enhance the death of C9orf72 HRE motor neurons implicating microglia-secreted molecules in non-cell autonomous mechanisms of C9orf72 HRE pathology. These findings provide evidence that C9orf72 HRE microglia have a cell-autonomous pro-inflammatory phenotype that contributes to non-cell autonomous mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS through dysregulated expression of specific genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated mechanisms.

">Juggling the Limits of Lucidity: Searching for Cognitive Constraints in Dream Motor Practice</a></h4>

              
                Lucid dreaming (LD), during which the dreamer becomes aware of the dream state, offers a unique opportunity for a variety of applications, including motor practice, personal well-being, and nightmare therapy. However, these applications largely depend on a dreamer's ability to control their dreams. While LD research has traditionally focused on induction techniques to increase dream frequency, the equally crucial skill of dream control remains underexplored. This study provides an initial investigation into the mechanisms of dream control and its potential influencing factors. We specifically examined whether a complex motor skill -juggling- could be performed within a lucid dream, creating a particularly challenging lucid dream task, which calls for a high level of dream control. Eight healthy participants (aged 24-50) underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) at the University of Bern's Institute for Sports Science, provided detailed dream reports, and completed questionnaires assessing dream control, self-efficacy, personality traits, mindfulness, motivation, and intention setting. Of these, four participants experienced lucid dreams, and of these, two demonstrated high dream control with successful LD juggling attempts. Trait differences between non-lucid and lucid dreamers in the lab were examined, with a focus on low-to-no dream control versus high dream control among the lucid dreamers. The two lucid dream juggling attempts are described in detail, providing insight into the challenges of executing complex tasks within a lucid dream. While this study lacks in sample size, it highlights the potential roles of many psychological traits, such as belief, motivation, and self-efficacy, in shaping dream control abilities. This study helps to lay the groundwork for future research aimed at investigating lucid dream control and therefore optimizing LD applications in therapy, sports training, and cognitive science.

">Phasic and tonic pain serve distinct functions during adaptive behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Pain drives self-protective behaviour, and evolutionary theories suggest it acts over different timescales to serve distinct functions. Whilst phasic pain provides a teaching signal to drive avoidance of new injury, tonic pain is argued to support recuperative behaviour, for instance by reducing motivational vigour. We test this hypothesis in an immersive virtual reality EEG foraging task where subjects harvested fruit in a forest: some fruit elicited brief phasic pain to the grasping hand, and this reduced choice probability. Simultaneously, tonic pressure pain to the contralateral upper arm was associated with reduced action velocities. This could be explained by a free-operant computational framework that formalises and quantifies the function of tonic and phasic pain in terms of motivational vigour and decision value, and model parameters correlated with EEG responses. Overall, the results show how tonic and phasic pain subserve distinct objective motivational functions that support harm minimisation during ongoing adaptive behaviour.

">Evidence accumulation from experience and observation in the cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                We use our experiences to form and update beliefs about the hidden states of the world. When possible, we also gather evidence by observing others. However, how the brain integrates experiential and observational evidence is not understood. We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in a two-player game with volatile hidden states. Both humans and monkeys successfully updated their beliefs while playing the game and observing their partner, though less effectively when observing. Electrophysiological recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence into a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment's state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational architecture of this integration and provided a neural account of the behavioral asymmetry between experiential and observational evidence accumulation. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying evidence accumulation in social contexts within the primate brain.

">Field-Programmable Gate Array Based Ultra-Low Power Discrete Fourier Transforms for Closed-Loop Neural Sensing</a></h4>

              
                Digital implementations of discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) are a mainstay in feature assessment of recorded biopotentials, particularly in the quantification of biomarkers of neurological disease state for adaptive deep brain stimulation. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms and architectures present a substantial power demand from onboard batteries in implantable medical devices, necessitating the development of ultra-low power Fourier transform methods in resource-constrained environments. Numerous FFT architectures aim to optimize power and resource demand through computational efficiency; however, prioritizing the reduction of logic complexity at the cost of additional computations can be equally or more effective. This paper introduces a minimal architecture single-delay feedback discrete Fourier transform (mSDF-DFT) for use in ultra-low-power field programmable gate array applications and shows energy and power improvements over state-of-the-art FFT methods. We observe a 33% reduction in dynamic power and 4% reduction in resource utilization in a neural sensing application when compared to state-of-the-art FFT algorithms. While designed for use in closed-loop deep brain stimulation and medical device implementations, the mSDF-DFT is also easily extendable to any ultra-low power embedded application.

">Informational Complexity as a Neural Marker of Cognitive Reserve</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a mismatch between neurological damage and cognitive functioning often is attributed to individual differences in cognitive reserve. Understanding the neural mechanism of cognitive reserve could help assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of interventions in AD. To address this, here, 38 elderly participants performed a sustained attention task during high-density EEG while awake and during drowsiness. Operationally, the degree to which performance was impaired under drowsiness signalled the extent of cognitive reserve, with less impairment indicating a higher level of cognitive reserve. Investigating performance variations during the active management of neural challenges offers a novel approach to studying cognitive reserve, capturing dynamics that mirror everyday cognitive demand. We related cognitive reserve to various measures, including informational complexity using the Lempel-Ziv (LZSUM) algorithm. We found a significant interaction effect between arousal and performance, where LZSUM values increased in high performers when drowsy but decreased in low performers. This effect was most pronounced in the frontal and central areas. Our findings suggest LZSUM to be indicative of a compensatory mechanism and thus show potential for LZSUM as a neural marker in assessing cognitive reserve. However, we found no consistent relationship between performance and structural brain measures, and proxies of cognitive reserve. Critically, our findings present a counterexample to the prevailing view that informational complexity purely reflects conscious level. Further research, such as a study with the same paradigm in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may lead to additional insights of whether we are truly measuring cognitive reserve.

">Nano-organization of synapses defines synaptic release properties at cortical neuron dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                Visualization of the submicron organization of excitatory synapses has revealed an unexpectedly ordered architecture consisting of nanocolumns of synaptic proteins that group into nanomodules which scale in number as spine size increases. How these features are related to synaptic function has remained unclear. Here, using super-resolution followed by live-cell line-scan imaging, we find that the size of the smallest miniature calcium and glutamate events are the same, regardless of whether spines have one or two nanopuncta of PSD-95, and that miniature synaptic response in all spines are best fit by a three term Poisson. Two nanomodule spines exhibit more large events without a significant change in event frequency, with the number of the largest events increasing disproportionately. These data support a model where nanomodules define sites of synaptic release and where the nanoarchitecture of synaptic proteins specifies subtypes of excitatory synapses, with increasing numbers of nanomodules increasing coordinated multivesicular release.

">Dynamics of infant white matter maturation from birth to 6 months</a></h4>

              
                The first months after a baby's birth encompass the most rapid period of postnatal change in the human lifespan, but longitudinal trajectories of white matter maturation in this period remain uncharted. Using densely sampled diffusion tensor images collected longitudinally at a mean rate of 1 scan per 1.55 days, we measured non-linear growth and growth rate trajectories of major white matter tracts from birth to 6 months. Growth rates at birth were 6 to 11 times faster than at 6 months, with tracts less mature at birth developing fastest. When matched on chronological age, shorter gestation infants had less mature white matter at birth but faster growth rates than their longer gestation peers; however, growth trajectories were highly similar when corrected for gestational age. This is the first study to estimate white matter trajectories using dense sampling in the first 6 post-natal months, which can inform the study of neurodevelopmental disorders beginning in infancy.

                Astrocytes play a pivotal role in central nervous system homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Despite advancements in single-cell analyses, the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly across species, remains understudied. Here, we present an integrated atlas of 187,000 astrocytes from mouse models of Alzheimer's (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) alongside 438,000 astrocytes from AD, MS, and Parkinson's (PD) patients. Our analysis identified four distinct mouse astrocyte clusters, including two disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) clusters, DAA1 and DAA2. DAA1 displayed reactivity resembling responses to acute stimuli, including endotoxemia, while DAA2 expressed well-known AD risk genes. In an AD model, DAA1 and DAA2 exhibited distinct spatial relationships to amyloid plaques. In humans, we identified eight distinct astrocyte clusters, encompassing homeostatic and disease-associated subtypes. Cross-species analysis linked disease-associated clusters while also highlighting divergent expression in others. Our astrocyte atlas is available through a user-friendly, searchable website: http://research-pub.gene.com/AstroAtlas/.

                The acquisition of novel muscle activity patterns is a key aspect of motor skill learning which can be seen at play, for example, when beginner musicians learn new guitar or piano chords. To study this process, here we introduce a new paradigm that requires quick and synchronous flexion and extension of multiple fingers. First, participants practiced all the 242 possible combinations of isometric finger flexion and extension around the metacarpophalangeal joint (i.e., chords). We found that some chords were initially extremely challenging, but participants could eventually achieve them with practice, showing that the initial difficulty did not reflect hard biomechanical constraints imposed by the interaction of tendons and ligaments. In a second experiment we found that chord learning was largely chord-specific and did not generalize to untrained chords. Finally, we explored which factors make some chords more difficult than others. Difficulty was well predicted by the muscle activity pattern required by that chord. Interestingly, difficulty related to how similar chords' muscle activity patterns are to the muscle activity patterns required by everyday hand use, and to the overall size of the muscle activity. Together, our results suggest that the new paradigm introduced in this work may provide a valuable tool to study the neural processes underlying the acquisition of novel muscle activity patterns in the human motor system.

">Glucocorticoids modulate expression of perineuronal net component genes and parvalbumin during development of mouse cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Severe prenatal maternal stress is a risk factor for schizophrenia in offspring. Since parvalbumin-containing GABAergic interneuron function in cortex and hippocampus is compromised in schizophrenia, and perineuronal nets (PNNs) facilitate the functioning of these cells, we tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids, as stress mediators that can access the foetal compartment, might influence the expression of PNN component genes. In cultured mouse cortical neurons, we detected effects of hydrocortisone on many PNN component genes, via diverse mechanisms. A rapid (<4h), glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated suppression of neurocan and hyaluronan synthase (Has) 1 and 3 mRNAs was observed at 7 days in vitro (DIV), whereas at 14DIV, brevican and versican expression was reduced by hydrocortisone without GR involvement, while GR inhibition elevated Has1 and Has2 mRNA levels and suppressed aggrecan mRNA levels. Tenascin R expression was rapidly suppressed by hydrocortisone at 7DIV but not at 14. At 21DIV, PNN component gene expression had become insensitive to hydrocortisone, although parvalbumin expression was reduced after 24h but not 4h exposure. Additionally, effects on protein levels were observed that were sometimes consistent with the mRNA changes (e.g. Has3, Gad1) and sometimes unrelated to them (e.g. elevated TnR levels at 14DIV after glucocorticoid receptor antagonism). We found that hydrocortisone could directly inhibit proteasome activity, potentially explaining the ability of hydrocortisone to increase Has2 levels. As expected from these results, the overall structure of the PNN was compromised by hydrocortisone exposure, with the length of proximal dendrite covered by PNN being reduced. Overall, the data demonstrate a complex and profound, but developmental stage-dependent, regulation of PNN component gene expression by glucocorticoids. This may contribute to the action of severe prenatal or perinatal stress to increase schizophrenia risk.

	<p>Growth mindset, which asserts that intelligence and abilities can be cultivated through effort and learning, has garnered substantial attention in psychological and educational research. While the psychological and behavioral impacts of growth mindset are well-established, the underlying neural mechanisms remain relatively underexplored. Furthermore, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews synthesizing the neural evidence on growth mindset, hindering a fuller understanding of this concept. This scoping review aims to synthesize existing empirical studies on the neural mechanisms of growth mindset, focusing on research objectives, methods, and participant characteristics. A total of 15 studies were reviewed, revealing six primary research objectives: (1) neural mechanisms of error and feedback processing, (2) domain-specific mindsets, (3) neural changes resulting from mindset interventions, (4) mindsets and grit, (5) the neuroanatomy of mindsets, and (6) neural mechanisms of stereotype violation, with error and feedback processing being the most frequently investigated. Ten of the 15 studies employed EEG, while other techniques included structural MRI, task-based fMRI, and resting-state fMRI, with the majority of research focusing on adult populations. Although the existing literature offers valuable insights, further research is needed to explore additional aspects of mindsets, particularly in children, and to refine the methodologies used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying growth mindset.</p>

	<p>Current standard of care treatment for patients with spine tumors includes multidisciplinary approaches, including the following: (1) surgical tumor debulking, epidural spinal cord decompression, and spine stabilization techniques; (2) systemic chemo/targeted therapies; (3) radiation therapy; and (4) surveillance imaging for local disease control and recurrence. Titanium pedicle screw and rod fixation have become commonplace in the spine surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s armamentarium for the stabilization of the spine following tumor resection and separation surgery. However, the high degree of imaging artifacts seen with titanium implants on postoperative CT and MRI scans can significantly hinder the accurate delineation of vertebral anatomy and adjacent neurovascular structures to allow for the safe and effective planning of downstream radiation therapies and detection of disease recurrence. Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) spine implants have emerged as a promising alternative to titanium due to the lack of artifact signals on CT and MRI, allowing for more accurate and safe postoperative radiation planning. In this article, we review the tenants of the surgical and radiation management of spine tumors and discuss the safety, efficacy, and current limitations of CFR-PEEK spine implants in the multidisciplinary management of spine oncology patients.</p>

	<p>Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract patterns from the environment, has been assumed to play a central role in whole cognition, particularly in language acquisition. Evidence has been gathered, however, from behavioral experiments relying on simplified artificial languages, raising doubts on the generalizability of these results to natural contexts. Here, we tested if SL is affected by the composition of the speech streams by expositing participants to auditory streams containing either four nonsense words presenting a transitional probability (TP) of 1 (unmixed high-TP condition), four nonsense words presenting TPs of 0.33 (unmixed low-TP condition) or two nonsense words presenting a TP of 1, and two of a TP of 0.33 (mixed condition); first under incidental (implicit), and, subsequently, under intentional (explicit) conditions to further ascertain how prior knowledge modulates the results. Electrophysiological and behavioral data were collected from the familiarization and test phases of each of the SL tasks. Behavior results revealed reliable signs of SL for all the streams, even though differences across stream conditions failed to reach significance. The neural results revealed, however, facilitative processing of the mixed over the unmixed low-TP and the unmixed high-TP conditions in the N400 and P200 components, suggesting that moderate levels of entropy boost SL.</p>

	<p>Aside from its immediate traumatic effects, spinal cord injury (SCI) presents multiple secondary complications that can be harmful to those who have been affected by SCI. Among these secondary effects, gut dysbiosis (GD) and the activation of the NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) like receptor-family pyrin-domain-containing three (NLRP3) inflammasome are of special interest for their roles in impacting mental health. Studies have found that the state of the gut microbiome is thrown into disarray after SCI, providing a chance for GD to occur. Metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and a variety of neurotransmitters produced by the gut microbiome are hampered by GD. This disrupts healthy cognitive processes and opens the door for SCI patients to be impacted by mental health disorders. Additionally, some studies have found an increased presence and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its respective parts in SCI patients. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can initiate and eventually aggravate mental health disorders after SCI. In addition to the mechanisms of GD and the NLRP3 inflammasome in intensifying mental health disorders after SCI, this review article further focuses on three promising treatments: fecal microbiome transplants, phytochemicals, and melatonin. Studies have found these treatments to be effective in combating the pathogenic mechanisms of GD and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as alleviating the symptoms these complications may have on mental health. Another area of focus of this review article is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to support treatments. AI models have already been developed to track changes in the gut microbiome, simulate drug-gut interactions, and design novel anti-NLRP3 inflammasome peptides. While these are promising, further research into the applications of AI for the treatment of mental health disorders in SCI is needed.</p>

	<p>Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) among schizophrenia patients in Germany and to identify factors associated with the risk of DAMA. Methods: This multicenter cross-sectional study was based on data from the IQVIA hospital database, which contains records from 36 hospitals across Germany. This study included all hospitalizations for patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of schizophrenia between January 2019 and December 2023. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, primary or secondary schizophrenia diagnosis, as well as codiagnoses, were conducted to assess the associations between demographic and clinical variables and DAMA. Results: A total of 7663 hospitalization cases (mean age: 49.5 years, 40.6% female) were included in the study. The DAMA rate was 31.1% in patients with schizophrenia as the primary diagnoses and 6.0% in patients with schizophrenia as a secondary diagnosis. Younger age (i.e., adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 7.44; 95% CI: 4.35&amp;amp;ndash;12.73 in the age group 18&amp;amp;ndash;30; aOR: 6.63; 95% CI: 3.89&amp;amp;ndash;11.29 in the age group 31&amp;amp;ndash;40; aOR: 5.59; 95% CI: 3.28&amp;amp;ndash;9.54 in the age group 41&amp;amp;ndash;50), schizophrenia as the primary diagnosis (aOR: 3.61; 95% CI: 3.05&amp;amp;ndash;4.26), alcohol-related disorders (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;2.04), and cannabis-related disorders (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;1.72) were significantly associated with an increased risk of DAMA. Conclusions: This study highlights the high prevalence of DAMA among hospitalized schizophrenia patients and identifies the important factors (i.e., younger age, alcohol-related disorders, and cannabis-related disorders) associated with DAMA risk. Additional studies are recommended for further exploration into the reasons for DAMA.</p>

	<p>Most brain development occurs in the &amp;amp;ldquo;first 1000 days&amp;amp;rdquo;, a critical period from conception to a child&amp;amp;rsquo;s second birthday. Critical brain processes that occur during this time include synaptogenesis, myelination, neural pruning, and the formation of functioning neuronal circuits. Perturbations during the first 1000 days likely contribute to later-life neurodegenerative disease, including sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neurodevelopment is determined by many events, including the maturation and colonization of the infant microbiome and its metabolites, specifically neurotransmitters, immune modulators, vitamins, and short-chain fatty acids. Successful microbiome maturation and gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis function depend on maternal factors (stress and exposure to toxins during pregnancy), mode of delivery, quality of the postnatal environment, diet after weaning from breast milk, and nutritional deficiencies. While the neonatal microbiome is highly plastic, it remains prone to dysbiosis which, once established, may persist into adulthood, thereby inducing the development of chronic inflammation and abnormal excitatory/inhibitory balance, resulting in neural excitation. Both are recognized as key pathophysiological processes in the development of ALS.</p>

	<p>Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a substantial burden for psychiatric care, affecting approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Adolescent populations with depression are a particularly challenging demographic to treat as early intervention is crucial to prevent treatment resistance, but treatment options are limited. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive option for TRD in adults as well as adolescents, offering hope for patients who have not responded to conventional therapies. This review examines the convergence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a tool to examine how TMS modulates functional connectivity in adolescents with MDD. Such analyses have led to advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD, TRD, and the mechanisms of TMS. We review this evidence, evaluate methodological approaches, and identify critical gaps in the existing literature, highlighting how neuroimaging-guided TMS protocols offer a promising therapeutic avenue for adolescent TRD, particularly in cases where conventional treatments have proven ineffective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-204/v1?src=rss">Towards Enhanced Healthcare: A Mixed Methods Exploration of Responsiveness in Gamo Gofa Zone Hospitals, Southern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assessing health service responsiveness is crucial for evaluating a health system’s ability to address non-health related aspects of care. This study aimed to assess the responsiveness of inpatient and outpatient services and identify influencing factors in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals, southern Ethiopia from March 2011 to June 2013. Methods A mixed methods approach was employed, involving systematic random sampling for surveys and purposive sampling for focus group discussions. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, mean score calculations, principal component analysis, and regression analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed qualitative data, which were triangulated with the quantitative findings. Results A survey of 419 individuals and focus group discussions with 72 participants revealed disparities in responsiveness. Dignity and confidentiality were rated high, while basic amenities for inpatients and prompt attention to outpatients were notably lacking. Principal component analysis identified patient-centered communication, patient-centered care environments, and prompt attention as key factors underlying responsiveness. The qualitative findings emphasized healthcare providers’ time insensitivity, inadequate facilities, and limited patient involvement in decision-making. Conclusion This study highlights significant gaps in health service responsiveness in Gamo Gofa zone hospitals. Interventions targeting deficiencies in patient-centered communication, patient- centered care environment and prompt attention can enhance healthcare quality and patient-centeredness. Addressing these areas is critical for improving the overall patient experience.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-955/v2?src=rss">Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Propensity to Cheat Scale Validation in the Ethiopian Public Higher Education Institutions [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study was primarily intended to validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

                Background Poverty remained pervasive in affecting households particularly in developing countries like Ethiopia. Purpose The main target of this study was to estimate the multidimensional poverty index of households in Debre Tabor city along with the analysis of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Method The researchers selected 394 households from six Kebeles using a stratified random sampling technique. The Alkire and Foster dual cut-off method of measuring poverty was employed to estimate the multidimensional poverty index and ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of determinants of multidimensional poverty. Five dimensions of poverty namely, income, education, health, living standards, and energy use were incorporated in measuring it. Results and conclusion The result revealed that 59% of households were multidimensional poor with a poverty cut-off of 33%. The multidimensional poor households were underprivileged in 54% of weighted indicators. The energy use dimension was a serious contributor to the incidence and severity of multidimensional poverty. In addition, poverty incidence by illiterate-headed household heads, with single marital status, and casual wage worker-headed households was higher relative to their counterparts. Policy recommendation We strongly recommended that education must be extensively provided not only to children but also to adults; females must be promoted to participate in business activities, credit must be expanded with an excellent follow-up, and households should participate in existing cooperatives.

                Background Pregnant women are a nutritionally vulnerable group that requires special attention due to the risk of malnutrition, which may result in low birth weight (LBW) infants. Enhancing nutritional status during pregnancy can be achieved through supplementation with locally sourced functional foods, such as dadih and bread. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dadih-based functional bread on nutritional intake, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods A randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 143 pregnant women, divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG, n = 77), who consumed dadih-based functional bread, and the control group (CG, n = 66), who consumed original functional bread. Data analysis used the independent t-test for normally distributed variables and the Mann–Whitney test for non-parametric variables. Results Significant differences were observed in carbohydrate intake during the third trimester between the IG (320.40 [198.24–666.72] grams/day) and CG (312.37 [137.87–556.85] grams/day; p = 0.019) and in fat intake (IG: 74.30 [25.53–245.47] grams/day; CG: 62.85 [21.71–128.59] grams/day; p = 0.025). A significant difference in BMI in the third month was noted between IG and CG (p = 0.025). However, no significant differences were observed in neonatal outcomes between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions Dadih demonstrates benefits for maternal health during pregnancy, its effects on fetal growth pa-rameters may be limited and potentially influenced by factors beyond maternal diet alone. Further research is required to explore dadih’s potential role in enhancing long-term child health outcomes.

Bacteria evolved genes whose single-cell distributions of expression levels are broad, or even bimodal. Evidence suggests that they might enhance phenotypic diversity for coping with fluctuating environments. We identified seven genes in <i>E. coli</i> with bimodal (low and high) single-cell expression levels under standard growth conditions and studied how their dynamics are modified by environmental and antibiotic stresses known to target gene expression. We found that all genes lose bimodality under some, but not under all, stresses. Also, bimodality can reemerge upon cells returning to standard conditions, which suggests that the genes can switch often between high and low expression rates. As such, these genes could become valuable components of future multi-stable synthetic circuits. Next, we proposed models of bimodal transcription dynamics with realistic parameter values, able to mimic the outcome of the perturbations studied. We explored several models’ tunability and boundaries of parameter values, beyond which it shifts to unimodal dynamics. From the model results, we predict that bimodality is robust, and yet tunable, not only by RNA and protein degradation rates, but also by the fraction of time that promoters remain unavailable for new transcription events. Finally, we show evidence that, although the empirical expression levels are influenced by many factors, the bimodality emerges during transcription initiation, at the promoter regions and, thus, may be evolvable and adaptable.

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are known for their hexagonal spatial activity patterns and are thought to provide a neural metric for space, and support path integration. In this study, we further investigate grid cells as a metric of space by optimising them for a conformal isometric (CI) map of space using a model based on a superposition of plane waves. By optimising the phases within a single grid cell module, we find that the module can form a CI of two-dimensional flat space with phases arranging into a regular hexagonal pattern, supporting an accurate spatial metric. Additionally, we find that experimentally recorded grid cells exhibit CI properties, with one example module showing a phase arrangement similar to the hexagonal pattern observed in our model. These findings provide computational and preliminary experimental support for grid cells as a CI-based spatial representation. We also examine other properties that emerge in CI-optimised modules, including consistent energy expenditure across space and the minimal cell count required to support unique representation of space and maximally topologically persistent toroidal population activity. Altogether, our results suggest that grid cells are well-suited to form a CI map, with several beneficial properties arising from this organisation.

conformal prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xianghao Zhan, Qinmei Xu, Yuanning Zheng, Guangming Lu, Olivier Gevaert</p>

Accurately labeling large datasets is important for biomedical machine learning yet challenging while modern data augmentation methods may generate noise in the training data, which may deteriorate machine learning model performance. Existing approaches addressing noisy training data typically rely on strict modeling assumptions, classification models and well-curated dataset. To address these, we propose a novel reliability-based training-data-cleaning method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method uses a small set of well-curated training data and leverages ICP-calculated reliability metrics to selectively correct mislabeled data and outliers within vast quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy is validated across three classification tasks with distinct modalities: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with free-text title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels of noise to the training labels were introduced via label permutation. Our training-data-cleaning method significantly enhanced the downstream classification performance (paired t-tests, <i>p</i> ≤ 0 . 05 among 30 random train/test partitions): significant accuracy enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4% increase from 0.812 to 0.905), significant AUROC and AUPRC enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% increase from 0.597 to 0.739 for AUROC, and 69.8% increase from 0.183 to 0.311 for AUPRC), and significant accuracy and macro-average F1-score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing experiments (up to 74.6% increase from 0.351 to 0.613 for accuracy, and 89.0% increase from 0.267 to 0.505 for F1-score). The improvement can be both statistically and clinically significant for information retrieval, disease diagnosis and prognosis. The method offers the potential to substantially boost classification performance in biomedical machine learning tasks without necessitating an excessive volume of well-curated training data or strong data distribution and modeling assumptions in existing semi-supervised learning methods.

Forecasting the occurrence and absence of novel disease outbreaks is essential for disease management, yet existing methods are often context-specific, require a long preparation time, and non-outbreak prediction remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework using a feature-based time series classification (TSC) method to forecast outbreaks and non-outbreaks. We tested our methods on synthetic data from a Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model for slowly changing, noisy disease dynamics. Outbreak sequences give a transcritical bifurcation within a specified future time window, whereas non-outbreak (null bifurcation) sequences do not. We identified incipient differences, reflected in 22 statistical features and 5 early warning signal indicators, in time series of infectives leading to future outbreaks and non-outbreaks. Classifier performance, given by the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC), ranged from 0 . 99 for large expanding windows of training data to 0 . 7 for small rolling windows. The framework is further evaluated on four empirical datasets: COVID-19 incidence data from Singapore, 18 other countries, and Edmonton, Canada, as well as SARS data from Hong Kong, with two classifiers exhibiting consistently high accuracy. Our results highlight detectable statistical features distinguishing outbreak and non-outbreak sequences well before potential occurrence, in both synthetic and real-world datasets presented in this study.

<i>Hermetia illucens</i> is an important insect resource. Studies have shown that exploring the effects of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed on the growth and development of the <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome holds significant scientific importance. There are three major challenges in the current studies of <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis: firstly, the lack of available genomic data which limits researchers in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data analysis. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature selection models designed specifically for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome. Unlike human genomic data, noise in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> data is a more serious problem. Third, how to choose those genes located in the pathway enrichment region. Existing models assume that each gene probe has the same priori weight. However, researchers usually pay more attention to gene probes which are in the pathway enrichment region. Based on the above challenges, we initially construct experiments and establish a new Cu<sup>2+</sup>-stressed <i>Hermetia illucens</i> growth genome dataset. Subsequently, we propose AWGE-ESPCA: an edge Sparse PCA model based on adaptive noise elimination regularization and weighted gene network. The AWGE-ESPCA model innovatively proposes an adaptive noise elimination regularization method, effectively addressing the noise challenge in <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genomic data. We also integrate the known gene-pathway quantitative information into the Sparse PCA(SPCA) framework as a priori knowledge, which allows the model to filter out the gene probes in pathway-rich regions as much as possible. Ultimately, this study conducts five independent experiments and compared four latest Sparse PCA models as well as representative supervised and unsupervised baseline models to validate the model performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superior pathway and gene selection capabilities of the AWGE-ESPCA model. Ablation experiments validate the role of the adaptive regularizer and network weighting module. To summarize, this paper presents an innovative unsupervised model for <i>Hermetia illucens</i> genome analysis, which can effectively help researchers identify potential biomarkers. In addition, we also provide a working AWGE - ESPCA model code in the address: https://github.com/yhyresearcher/AWGE_ESPCA.

                <p>by Alexa Aucoin, Kevin K. Lin, Katalin M. Gothard</p>

The amygdala responds to a large variety of socially and emotionally salient environmental and interoceptive stimuli. The context in which these stimuli occur determines their social and emotional significance. In canonical neurophysiological studies, the fast-paced succession of stimuli and events induce phasic changes in neural activity. During inter-trial intervals neural activity is expected to return to a stable and featureless level of spontaneous activity, often called baseline. In previous studies we found that context, such as the presence of a social partner, induces brain states that can transcend the fast-paced succession of stimuli and can be recovered from the spontaneous, inter-trial firing rate of neurons. Indeed, the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in the amygdala are different during blocks of gentle grooming touches delivered by a trusted social partner, and during blocks of non-social airflow stimuli delivered by a computer-controlled air valve. Here, we examine local field potentials (LFPs) recorded during periods of spontaneous activity to determine whether information about context can be extracted from these signals. We found that information about social vs. non-social context is present in the local field potential during periods of spontaneous activity between the application of grooming and airflow stimuli, as machine learning techniques can reliably decode context from spectrograms of spontaneous LFPs. No significant differences were detected between the nuclei of the amygdala that receive direct or indirect inputs from areas of the prefrontal cortex known to coordinate flexible, context-dependent behaviors. The lack of nuclear specificity suggests that context-related synaptic inputs arise from a shared source, possibly interoceptive inputs, that signal the physiological state of the body during social and non-social blocks of tactile stimulation.

Fungi can intervene in hosts’ brain function. In humans, they can drive neuroinflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. However, how fungi alter the host brain is unknown. The mechanism underlying innate immunity to fungi is well-known and universally conserved downstream of shared Toll/TLR receptors, which via the adaptor MyD88 and the transcription factor Dif/NFκB, induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, in the brain, Toll-1 could also drive an alternative pathway via Sarm, which causes cell death instead. Sarm is the universal inhibitor of MyD88 and could drive immune evasion. Here, we show that exposure to the fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> reduced fly life span, impaired locomotion and caused neurodegeneration. <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> entered the <i>Drosophila </i>brain and induced the up-regulation of <i>AMPs</i>, and the Toll adaptors <i>wek</i> and <i>sarm</i>, within the brain. RNAi knockdown of <i>Toll-1, wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> concomitantly with infection prevented <i>B. bassiana-</i>induced cell loss. By contrast, over-expression of <i>wek</i> or <i>sarm</i> was sufficient to cause neuronal loss in the absence of infection. Thus, <i>B. bassiana</i> caused cell loss in the host brain via Toll-1/Wek/Sarm signalling driving immune evasion. A similar activation of Sarm downstream of TLRs upon fungal infections could underlie psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

Tropical forests hold most of Earth’s biodiversity and a higher concentration of threatened mammals than other biomes. As a result, some mammal species persist almost exclusively in protected areas, often within extensively transformed and heavily populated landscapes. Other species depend on remaining remote forested areas with sparse human populations. However, it remains unclear how mammalian communities in tropical forests respond to anthropogenic pressures in the broader landscape in which they are embedded. As governments commit to increasing the extent of global protected areas to prevent further biodiversity loss, identifying the landscape-level conditions supporting wildlife has become essential. Here, we assessed the relationship between mammal communities and anthropogenic threats in the broader landscape. We simultaneously modeled species richness and community occupancy as complementary metrics of community structure, using a state-of-the-art community model parameterized with a standardized pan-tropical data set of 239 mammal species from 37 forests across 3 continents. Forest loss and fragmentation within a 50-km buffer were associated with reduced occupancy in monitored communities, while species richness was unaffected by them. In contrast, landscape-scale human density was associated with reduced mammal richness but not occupancy, suggesting that sensitive species have been extirpated, while remaining taxa are relatively unaffected. Taken together, these results provide evidence of extinction filtering within tropical forests triggered by anthropogenic pressure occurring in the broader landscape. Therefore, existing and new reserves may not achieve the desired biodiversity outcomes without concurrent investment in addressing landscape-scale threats.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.087, p = 0.001). Social support was significantly related to Academic stress (β = 0.117, p = 0.031) and self-efficacy (β =0.088, p = 0.021). However, both social support (β = 0.099, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.646, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.012, CI [0.002, 0.024], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.057, CI [0.006, 0.111], p = 0.068). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable wastes used as an alternative for fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, ecologically friendly, sustainable energy source that is also a reliable method to handle food waste. Methods This study used rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F to maximize the production of biogas from household consumption of three substrates such as cattle manure, cafeteria leftover foods, and fruit and vegetable wastes. Plastic 0.6 L digesters operating at a mesophilic temperature (30°C) were used to produce biogas from the mixed waste. Biogas production was recorded after the 60-day retention period. Standard methods were used to figure out parameters like pH, total solids, organic carbon volatile solids, and moisture content of the raw mixed wastes. This study was carried out experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result The corresponding VS/TS ratios for cattle manure, fruit and vegetable waste, and leftover cafeteria food waste were 91.2%, 80.2%, and 78.3%. More biogas was produced using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F than from mixed wastes without inoculums. The highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml) was generated by mixing 10 ml of S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F with the rumen fluids (100 ml). The digester that included 100 ml of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae was the optimum performance for biogas production. Conclusion This result suggests that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculums in a biogas digestor can enhance the production of biogas.

                Microglia are known to be involved in the modulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Jacquet et al. describe how microglia degrade larger Aβ aggregates by forming lysosomal synapses, further implicating the microglial release of lysosomal Aβ, amongst other processes, in the growth and spread of fibrillary Aβ.

                Zhou et al. demonstrate that exposure to extracellular LDs triggers a global transcriptional response in macrophages, leading to attenuation of proinflammatory signaling. TREM2 and MS4A7 are dispensable for LD efferocytosis but contribute to its inhibitory effects on macrophage inflammatory response.

                Lu et al. show the mechanism of APA regulation in macrophages upon VSV infection. MAVS activates the nuclear import of SYVN1, and then SYVN1 catalyzes the ubiquitination of CPSF6, resulting in CPSF6 degradation, APA switching, and antiviral effects. They identify the APA regulation mechanism in antiviral immune responses.
