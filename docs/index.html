              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-480/v1?src=rss">How Smart Can Museums Be? The Role of Cutting-Edge Technologies in Making Modern Museums Smarter [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive research on technology-mediated visitor experiences, a holistic approach to the smart museum remains underexplored. This paper addresses the gap by examining novel technologies through a cultural lens, particularly their role in enhancing modern museums. We defined the concept and profile of the 21st-century smart museum based on a synthesis of findings from 83 papers and museum reports (2014–2024) on the modern museum, the museum experience, and the integration of innovative technologies. , Of these, 54 articles focused on six main technology categories—Extended Reality (XR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Robots, Fusion, and others (Blockchain, Holography)—were reviewed. From the intersection of museums and technology in the digital era, 15 key characteristics emerged, outlining the ideal smart museum. This paper aims to serve as a framework and guide for cultural managers, museum professionals, and designers in creating and implementing smart museums.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03308">An Active Inference perspective on Neurofeedback Training</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurofeedback training (NFT) aims to teach self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback, but suffers from highly variable outcomes and poorly understood mechanisms, hampering its validation. To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance. This approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability, interpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training protocols.

                arXiv:2505.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neomycin resistance cassette (Neo+) is commonly inserted in the genome of mice to generate knock-out (KO) models. The effect of gene deletion on social behaviors in mice is controversial between studies using different Neo+ and Neo-mouse lines, particularly Arc/Arg3.1 KO lines. In this study, we identified severe maternal behavior impairments in Neo+, but not Neo-Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams. These deficits resulted from reduced sociability and abnormal social information processing in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO dams, exacerbated by social communication impairments in pups. The expression of the Neo cassette product did not cause cytotoxicity, but led to altered ERK signaling, gene expression, and oxytocin system. However, oxytocin administration did not improve social impairments in Neo+ Arc/Arg3.1 KO animals. Interestingly, early social environment enrichment enhanced social interaction with familiar, but not unfamiliar conspecifics or maternal behavior. Overall, our findings reveal a major impact of the Neo cassette on behaviors, particularly social behaviors, in Arc/Arg3.1 KO mice, underscoring the need to re-examine phenotypes of animal models carrying the Neo cassette in neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03458">The classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment improved by dynamic functional network analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03648">Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.

                arXiv:2505.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw on the predictive processing theory of perception to explain why healthy, intelligent, honest, and psychologically normal people might easily misperceive lights in the sky as threatening or extraordinary objects, especially in the context of WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) societies. We argue that the uniquely sparse properties of skyborne and celestial stimuli make it difficult for an observer to update prior beliefs, which can be easily fit to observed lights. Moreover, we hypothesize that humans have likely evolved to perceive the sky and its perceived contents as deeply meaningful. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible role of generalized distrust in scientific institutions and ultimately argue for the importance of astronomy education for producing a society with prior beliefs that support veridical perception.

                arXiv:2505.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18850">Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.

                arXiv:2505.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.

                arXiv:2505.03510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

                arXiv:2505.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) that is inspired by protozoa in nature. The APO mimics the survival mechanisms of protozoa by simulating their foraging, dormancy, and reproductive behaviors. The APO was mathematically modeled and implemented to perform the optimization processes of metaheuristic algorithms. The performance of the APO was verified via experimental simulations and compared with 32 state-of-the-art algorithms. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for pairwise comparisons of the proposed APO with the state-of-the-art algorithms, and Friedman test was used for multiple comparisons. First, the APO was tested using 12 functions of the 2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation benchmark. Considering practicality, the proposed APO was used to solve five popular engineering design problems in a continuous space with constraints. Moreover, the APO was applied to solve a multilevel image segmentation task in a discrete space with constraints. The experiments confirmed that the APO could provide highly competitive results for optimization problems. The source codes of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer are publicly available at https://seyedalimirjalili.com/projects and https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/162656-artificial-protozoa-optimizer.

                arXiv:2505.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04497">A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2304.04497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842">Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21254">ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.21254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sserranw/ABG-NAS.

                arXiv:2505.02369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

">Diverse and Flexible Strategies Enable Successful Cooperation in Marmoset Dyads</a></h4>

              
                In humans, cooperation relies on advanced social cognition, but the extent to which these mechanisms support cooperation in nonhuman primates remains unclear. To investigate this, we examined freely moving marmoset dyads in a cooperative lever-pulling task. Marmosets successfully coordinated actions, relying on social vision rather than environmental cues. Blocking visual access or replacing the partner with an automated agent disrupted coordination. Causal dependencies between social gaze and pull actions revealed both gaze-dependent and gaze-independent strategies. Cooperation depended on social relationships, including dominance, kinship, and sex. Remarkably, marmosets adapted strategies based on partner identity, indicating rapid social learning and memory. Altogether, these findings show that flexible, cognitively driven cooperation extends more broadly across primates than previously recognized, informing our understanding of cooperative behavior mechanisms and evolution.

">EGFR activation correlates with intracranial pressure and outcome in a mixed intracranial bleeding porcine model</a></h4>

              
                The pig model is an advanced system for studying human brain injury due to its anatomical similarities with the brain, such as brain size, gyrencephalic structure, skull shape, and white-to-gray matter ratio. Brain hemorrhage increases intracranial pressure through blood accumulation and brain swelling, leading to impaired cerebral blood flow, ischemia, and potentially, secondary injury, thus further exacerbating neurological damage. This study investigates the role of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the injury response and clinical outcomes, focusing on their potential as therapeutic targets for intracranial pressure control after injury. To this end, we developed a sustained, resuscitated pig model of acute mixed intracranial bleeding with ICP and hemorrhagic shock. Multimodal brain monitoring and neurological assessments offered insights into the progression of the injury. Our findings showed that 36-48 hours post-injury, animals exhibited signs of cerebral tissue hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and extensive tissue damage. Elevated HIF1- expression in the injured hemisphere confirmed local hypoperfusion. Inflammatory markers such as TNF-, CD68, and MMP-9 were upregulated in both hemispheres, reflecting a generalized neuroinflammatory response. Gene expression analysis revealed increased markers of vascular, astrocytic, and neuroimmune activation, particularly related to endothelial integrity and astrocyte activation. RTK expression analysis showed increased levels of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie-2, EGFR, and Axl in the injured cortex, with activation of EGFR/ErbB4 and HGFR/Met pathways. Hierarchical clustering of our transcriptional analysis revealed distinct patterns of activation, highlighting the direct relationship between severity of ICP increase and astrocyte response. In particular, EGFR phosphorylation correlated with i) severity of ICP increase, ii) neurological evaluation using a modified Glasgow Coma Scale, and iii) survival. These findings suggest that modulating EGFR signaling may offer a therapeutic approach for managing ICP and improving outcome in traumatic brain injury.

">Synaptic vesicles that store monoamines and glutamate differ in protein composition.</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators such as the monoamines are known to differ from classical neurotransmitters like glutamate in the time scale of signaling due to activation of slower G protein-coupled receptors. Recent work has suggested that the mode of release also differs between classical and modulatory transmitters. Although many components of neurotransmitter release machinery have been identified, we still understand little about the mechanisms responsible for differences in release. In this study, we address the differences between release of dopamine and glutamate by comparing the composition of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that contain the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) versus vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2). Previous work has shown that these SV populations differ in frequency dependence, recycling kinetics and biogenesis. Taking advantage of a CRISPR-generated knock-in mouse with a cytoplasmic hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of VMAT2 to immunoisolate monoamine SVs, we find differences in the abundance and isoform expression of many SV protein families. Validation in primary neurons and in brain tissue confirms these differences in SV protein abundance between dopamine and glutamate release sites. Functional analysis reveals that the loss of differentially expressed SCAMP5 selectively impairs the recycling of VGLUT2 SVs, sparing VMAT2 vesicles in the same neuronal population. These findings provide new insights into the molecular diversity of SVs and the mechanisms that regulate the release of dopamine and glutamate, with implications for the physiological role of these transmitters and behavior.

                Background Occupational mental health is a growing global concern, particularly in high-demand service industries. Food handlers —such as chefs, kitchen staff, and waiters—often work under physically and emotionally demanding conditions, including long hours, low autonomy, verbal aggression, and customer-facing stress. Studies suggest they face an elevated risk of mental health disorders such as stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. Despite their vulnerability, evidence on the occupational factors influencing mental health among food handlers remains fragmented and sparse. Objective This scoping review aims to systematically map existing global literature on the occupational antecedents, mental health outcomes, and intervening factors affecting professional food handlers. The review will identify key determinants, consequences, and contextual influences to inform future research, workplace interventions, and policy development. Inclusion criteria We will include empirical studies—quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods—that explore occupational mental health among professional food handlers in structured food service settings (e.g., restaurants, catering, institutional kitchens). Grey literature, including dissertations, policy documents, and industry reports, will be included if publicly available and methodologically transparent. Only English-language sources published between 2000 and 2024 will be considered. Methods This scoping review will follow the JBI methodology and Arksey and O’Malley’s (2005) five-stage framework: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) data charting; and (5) collating and reporting results. Systematic searches will be conducted across databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. Grey literature will be retrieved from institutional repositories, professional bodies, and relevant websites. Data will be extracted using a standardized form and analyzed thematically to describe the scope, trends, and research gaps.

                Background Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is caused by the FMD virus (FMDV) in cloven-hoofed animals and has an economic impact on the livestock industry. On April 28, 2022, the re-emergence of this disease in Indonesia was confirmed. Commercial FMD vaccine containing the Manisa O1 strain is labile, and cannot provide cross-protection against other serotypes and circulating FMDV strain in Indonesia. Currently, no FMD vaccine in Indonesia contains locally isolated viruses. Therefore, it is imperative to develop FMD vaccines containing local isolates, given the nature of this virus, which lacks cross-protection and has low immunogenicity. This study aimed to evaluate the immune response in mice (Mus musculus) post-immunization with an FMDV master seed candidate for vaccine development. Method The study employs Flow cytometry was used to measure the activation of helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, and indirect ELISA was used to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-specific antibodies. This study was divided into four groups and five-point observations were conducted (D0, D14, D21, D28, and D56). The first treatment was on D0, and the second was on D14. All treatments were administered intramuscularly to the thigh muscles. Results The inactivated FMD virus elicited a diverse immune response across all groups for various observations (P<0.05). MontanideTM ISA O/W adjuvant added to inactivated FMD virus titers of 106 TCDID50 and 107 TCID50 can provide a better post-immunization immune response than the other two groups. The optimal formulation for immune responses is a combination of inactivated FMD virus titers of 107 TCID50 with MontanideTM ISA O/W. The activation of helper T cells dominates the cellular immune response compared to cytotoxic T cells. The IgG-specific antibody response was stronger than the cellular immune response. Further research is needed to investigate the potency of master seed candidate in animal models high level (Guinea pig).

                Background Traditional weaving professionals pull cloth manually during the handloom process, which can lead to several unnoticed musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate the effectiveness of cloth-pulling devices for Praewa silk weavers in Thailand. Methods An experimental trial was conducted using surface electromyography to evaluate weavers’ muscle activity, productivity and perceived satisfaction during the Praewa silk-pulling process while employing traditional cloth pulling, using a standard cloth-pulling device and using an ergonomic prototype cloth-pulling device. Results The results showed that the levels of muscle activity and hand activity with the prototype design were generally lower than those with traditional cloth pulling and with the standard cloth-pulling device (p < 0.01). There was a significant preference for the prototype, based on productivity and perceived satisfaction (p < 0.01). Conclusions The new cloth-pulling device was found to be applicable and acceptable among the weavers. Further research is needed to make appropriate revisions to the ergonomically designed tool based on ergonomic measurements of muscle activity and fatigue under field production conditions.

                <p>by Kaushik N. Shankar, Talid Sinno, Scott L. Diamond</p>

During thrombosis, platelets rapidly deposit and activate on the vessel wall, driving conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The complexity of thrombus formation in pathological flow geometries, along with patient-specific pharmacological responses, presents an opportunity for computational modeling to help deliver novel diagnostic and therapeutic insights. In the present study, we employed a multiscale 3D computational model that incorporates unique donor-derived neural networks (NNs) trained with platelet calcium mobilization traces under combinatorial exposure to 6 agonists (n = 10 donors). The 3D model comprises four modules: a donor-specific NN model for platelet calcium mobilization, a lattice kinetic Monte Carlo solver for tracking platelet motion and bonding, a finite volume method solver for modeling soluble agonist release and convective-diffusive transport, and a lattice Boltzmann method solver for predicting the blood velocity field. Simulations were conducted for platelets from individual blood donors under venous and arterial flow conditions on a defined collagen surface, examining the effects of inhibiting ADP and TXA<sub>2</sub>, as well as the influence of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The results reveal significant individual variability in platelet responses, influencing simulated thrombus growth dynamics and emphasizing the importance of personalized models for predicting thrombotic behavior. This approach enables consideration of patient-specific platelet signaling, drug responses, and vascular geometry for predicting thrombotic episodes, essential for advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes in thrombotic conditions.

                <p>by Catalina M. Medina, Julia A. Palacios, Volodymyr M. Minin</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that fast and accurate analysis of continually collected infectious disease surveillance data is crucial for situational awareness and policy making. Coalescent-based phylodynamic analysis can use genetic sequences of a pathogen to estimate changes in its effective population size, a measure of genetic diversity. These changes in effective population size can be connected to the changes in the number of infections in the population of interest under certain conditions. Phylodynamics is an important set of tools because its methods are often resilient to the ascertainment biases present in traditional surveillance data (e.g., preferentially testing symptomatic individuals). Unfortunately, it takes weeks or months to sequence and deposit the sampled pathogen genetic sequences into a database, making them available for such analyses. These reporting delays severely decrease precision of phylodynamic methods closer to present time, and for some models can lead to extreme biases. Here we present a method that affords reliable estimation of the effective population size trajectory closer to the time of data collection, allowing for policy decisions to be based on more recent data. Our work uses readily available historic times between sampling and reporting of sequenced samples for a population of interest, and incorporates this information into the sampling model to mitigate the effects of reporting delay in real-time analyses. We illustrate our methodology on simulated data and on SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the state of Washington in 2021.

                <p>by Sarafa A. Iyaniwura, Tyler Cassidy, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Alan S. Perelson</p>

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is strongly associated with increased risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis. While existing treatments effectively inhibit the HBV life cycle, viral rebound frequently occurs following treatment interruption. Consequently, functional cure rates of chronic HBV infection remain low and there is increased interest in a novel treatment modality, capsid assembly modulators (CAMs). Here, we develop a multiscale mathematical model of CAM treatment in chronic HBV infection. By fitting the model to participant data from a phase I trial of the first-generation CAM vebicorvir, we estimate the drug’s dose-dependent effectiveness and identify the physiological mechanisms that drive the observed biphasic decline in HBV DNA and RNA, and mechanistic differences between HBeAg-positive and negative infection. Finally, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that the relative change of HBV RNA more accurately reflects the antiviral effectiveness of a CAM than the relative change in HBV DNA.

                <p>by Aishwarya Ramakrishnan Iyer, Eva Scholz-Carlson, Evardra Bell, Grace Biondi, Shlesha Richhariya, Maria P. Fernandez</p>

The circadian system regulates the timing of multiple molecular, physiological, metabolic, and behavioral phenomena. In <i>Drosophila,</i> as in other species, most of the research on how the timekeeping system in the brain controls the timing of behavioral outputs has been conducted in males, or sex has not been included as a biological variable. A critical set of circadian pacemaker neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> release the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), which functions as a key output factor in the network with complex effects on other clock neurons. Lack of <i>Pdf</i> or its receptor, <i>PdfR,</i> results in most flies displaying arrhythmicity in activity–rest cycles under constant conditions. However, our results show that female circadian rhythms are less affected by mutations in both <i>Pdf</i> and <i>PdfR</i>. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of <i>Pdf,</i> specifically in ventral lateral neurons (LN<sub>v</sub>s), also has a greater effect on male rhythms. We tested the influence of M-cells on the circadian network and showed that speeding up the molecular clock specifically in M-cells led to sexually dimorphic phenotypes, with a more pronounced effect on male rhythmic behavior. Our results suggest that the female circadian system is more resilient to manipulations of M-cells and the PDF pathway, suggesting that circadian timekeeping is more distributed across the clock neuron network in females.

                Background Darwin assumed that the peacock’s long train was maladaptive and was the indirect effect of selection by female mate choice based on the train’s beauty. While a relationship between the feathers elaborate features and mating success has been shown in some studies, what features of the train females are attracted to remains controversial. Methods We used museum specimens to examine the anatomical plan underlying feather development responsible for the train’s symmetry. We developed a model based on an alternate arrangement of primordial feather buds during development and locations of concentric circles of eyespot distribution using the pattern on the train as a template. Results We observed a zigzag pattern of feather follicles that determined both the number and the arrangement of eyespots on the train. Our model explains the bilateral symmetry of train feathers, the hexagonal arrangement of eyespots on the train, and the concentric color rings of the eyespots. While the zigzag pattern explains the symmetry, complexity, and (structural) beauty of the peacock’s train, it also precludes variation in eyespot number except by annual addition of new feathers as a function of age. Conclusions We propose a multimodal model of mate choice which holds that (1) eyespot number and feather length are developmentally correlated and females see them not as separate traits but as one complex trait combining both, (2) females may not always choose males with the largest number of eyespots, as old males may lack vigor, and (3) females may choose mates on the basis of train size, vigor, and beauty. The maladaptation of the long tail is a byproduct of the adaptation of the tall train. Who would have thought that zigzag arrangement, the densest form of spherical packing, when applied to the living world would produce such profound effects on phenotypic diversity.

                Background Despite increasing interest in changing and improving play opportunities in schools, there is lack of openly available methods for evaluating play quantitatively. Existing measures often focus on physical activity during play activities or prioritise the mapping of locations within which play occurs rather than evaluating play itself. Methods This paper introduces the Multidimensional Toolkit for the Assessment of Play in Schools (M-TAPS) and provides the results of an initial study examining the utility and reliability of the toolkit. The M-TAPS includes observations of individual children and scan observations of predefined areas of the playground; children’s activities, adventure/risk level and affect are coded. In addition, the M-TAPS includes child self-report questionnaires about emotions during playtime and playtime activities. Results The reliability study provided evidence of good reliability between coders and for children’s self-report of their emotions during playtime. There was some indication of validity between child self-report and coder observation. Conclusions The paper suggests that the M-TAPS may be useful for research focused on improving children’s play in schools where a quantitative measure is sought. The M-TAPS provides a flexible tool for supporting researchers with the results highlighting how the M-TAPS can provide insights into schools playtimes and how observation can be combined with children’s self-report. There is room for further development and refinement of the toolkit.

                Subthreshold mental disorders (SMDs), characterized by clusters of psychiatric symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis yet are sufficiently severe to impair daily functioning. SMDs exhibit a high prevalence and an elevated risk of progression to diagnosed disorders and impose a substantial socioeconomic burden. Despite their significant impact, SMDs often go overlooked and untreated due to a global shortage of mental health professionals and stigmatization associated with conventional psychological and psychiatric treatments. This perspective advocates the integration of Chinese medicine (CM) as a first-line treatment for SMDs in primary care settings. Emerging evidence has shown that CM treatments, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and other modalities, can be effective in managing various mental disorders. Systematic reviews have shown that herbal medicine not only has fewer side effects compared to psychotropic medications but also reduces adverse effects when used as adjunctive therapy. The potential benefits of using CM include mitigating the shortage of mental health professionals by supplementing primary care, preventing the exacerbation of SMDs, alleviating workforce shortages, and offering a less stigmatized, cost-effective option that could improve help-seeking behaviors. However, challenges such as lack of recognition, insufficient collaboration between CM and mental health specialists, and differing theoretical frameworks hinder its integration into primary care in the mental health care field. Addressing these challenges will require public education, robust research evidence, policy changes, and the development of collaborative frameworks. This study highlights the need for greater recognition and integration of CM as a viable first-line treatment for the management of SMDs within primary care settings.

                Background Intensive care units (ICUs) are essential for patient recovery, but prolonged stays often result in complications like reduced mobility and muscle weakness. Aims This study examines current ICU rehabilitation practices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through a web-based cross-sectional survey involving 80 physiotherapists from both public and private sectors. Methods A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among licensed ICU physiotherapists in UAE hospitals between September 2022 and December 2023. A validated, reliable questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = 0.843) was distributed electronically. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed using SPSS v27. Results Over 96% of respondents required physician referrals for ICU sessions, while 75% reported access to hospital-provided development programs. A wide range of physiotherapy interventions was reported. Respiratory therapy, joint mobilization, and electrical stimulation used frequently, while massage and taping applied inconsistently. Practices varied notably across adult and neonatal ICUs, particularly in passive range of motion exercises (85.7%) and parental involvement (69%) in neonatal care. The findings also revealed significant variability in clinical approaches and limited adherence to standardized protocols. Conclusion The study underscores the importance of implementing standardized rehabilitation protocols and enhancing patient education to improve outcomes in ICU settings.

                Background Addressing preservice teachers' emotions can help them develop the emotional connections necessary for successful teaching practicums and professional learning experiences. To understand preservice teachers’ emotions towards their surroundings, the researchers used an emotional geography framework to map out the source of their negative and positive emotions and how those feelings affect their beliefs, teaching style, and paradigms. Emotional geographies were divided into two categories (i.e., emotional distance and emotional closeness), which were further mapped into five major themes (i.e., sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political). This study aims to investigate the emotional geographies of graduate preservice teachers during their teaching practicums in Indonesia by adapting Hargreaves’ (2001) theoretical model, thereby identifying key dimensions and validating the adapted framework. Methods This study examined emotional geographies of 15 graduate preservice student teachers of Teacher Training and Education Faculty of Mulawarman University during their teaching practicums. Moreover, this study used a qualitative design involving semi-structured interviews with 15 graduate students who completed their teaching practicums. Results The participants experienced all emotional geographies (sociocultural, moral, professional, physical, and political) that reshaped their beliefs and teaching styles, especially related to teaching undergraduate students. These emotions are generally experienced when the participants deal with the students and cooperating teachers. Conclusions It was found that teachers needed to be strict when instilling discipline in their students, develop friendships with their students to maintain classroom control, and require comprehensive preparation to create teacher's confidence and answer their students' questions. In effect, the theoretical framework of emotional geography when teaching undergraduates during practicums gave student teachers valuable experience to cope with all common teaching challenges and professional growth.

                Background At the 2020 UN General Assembly, China pledged to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, the traditional social development model has led to increasing carbon emissions annually, highlighting the need to resolve the contradiction between development and carbon reduction. This study examines the relationship between carbon emissions, economy, population, and energy consumption in a specific region to support carbon peak and neutrality goals. Methods A comprehensive indicator system was established, encompassing economic, population, energy consumption, and carbon emissions indicators. The study analyzed these factors during the 12th and 13th Five Year Plans, comparing total carbon emissions in 2010 and across the plans, and assessing trends. It also comprehensively analyzed the relationships and mutual influences among these factors. The study identified the main challenges in achieving carbon peak and neutrality. Using the Kaya model and various factor models, it calculated carbon peak times for three scenarios: baseline (2022), natural (2036), and ambitious (2021). These findings provide a basis for dual carbon path planning. Result The research results indicate that carbon emissions are closely related to the economy, population, and energy consumption. The prediction shows that the future trend of carbon emissions is controllable. Suggestions for dual carbon path planning are proposed to provide empirical basis for policy formulation. Under the baseline scenario, the peak carbon emissions are expected to occur around 2022; Under natural circumstances, the peak carbon emissions will be postponed to 2036; In the ambitious scenario, the carbon peak time can be advanced to 2021. Conclusion The research results are crucial for achieving carbon reduction targets and sustainable development and can be used to formulate targeted policies to promote regional development and support China’s carbon neutrality commitments.

                Objective This study aimed to evaluate hematologic, biochemical, and gasometric parameters in Wistar rats to better understand brain death parameters and reduce early misdiagnoses. Methods Fifteen adult male Wistar rats (Rattus norvergicus; HanUnib: WH) were randomly distributed into three groups of five animals: the control group (G0) with evaluation performed before brain death, and two groups (G1 and G2) with brain death induced at different times: immediately after induction (G1) and one hour after induction (G2). Venous and arterial blood samples were taken to perform complete blood count, biochemical, and blood gas assays. Samples were taken at specific times based on the group each rat belonged to. Results Statistically significant mean values were observed (P<0,05) for segmented cells (G1>G2 and G0>G2), monocytes (G2>G1 and G0>G1), creatinine (G2>G0), aspartate aminotransferase (G1>G0), potassium (G2>G0), and bicarbonate (G0>G1). Discussion Furthermore, brain death showed a unique response in each organism, complicating its precise determination even more.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus subfield of the hippocampus is thought to be critically involved in the disambiguation of similar episodic experiences and places in a context-dependent manner. However, most empirical evidence has come from lesion and gene knock-out studies in rodents, in which the dentate gyrus is permanently perturbed and compensation of affected functions via other areas within the memory circuit could take place. The acute and causal role of the dentate gyrus herein remains therefore elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the acute role of the dorsal dentate gyrus in disambiguation learning using reversible inhibitory DREADDs. Rats were trained on a location discrimination task and learned to discriminate between a rewarded and unrewarded location with either small (similar condition) or large (dissimilar condition) separation. Reward contingencies switched after applying a reversal rule, allowing us to track the temporal engagement of the dentate gyrus during the task. Bilateral DREADD modulation of the dentate gyrus impaired the initial acquisition learning of place-reward associations, but performance rapidly recovered to baseline levels within the same session. Modeling of the behavioral patterns revealed that reward sensitivity and alternation behavior were temporally associated with the DG-dependent impairment during acquisition learning. Our study thus provides novel evidence that the dorsal dentate gyrus is acutely engaged during the initial acquisition learning of place-reward associations.</p>

                Neuromelanin is a unique pigment made by some human catecholamine neurons. These neurons survive with their neuromelanin content for a lifetime but can also be affected by age-related neurodegenerative conditions, as observed using new neuromelanin imaging techniques. The limited quantities of neuromelanin has made understanding its normal biology difficult, but recent rodent and primate models, as well as omics studies, have confirmed its importance for selective neuronal loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We review the development of neuromelanin in dopamine versus noradrenaline neurons and focus on previously overlooked cellular organelles in neuromelanin formation and function. We discuss the role of neuromelanin in stimulating endogenous α-synuclein misfolding in PD which renders neuromelanin granules vulnerable, and can exacerbates other pathogenic processes.

                Gut commensals regulate neurological disorders through dynamic bidirectional communication along the gut–brain axis. Recent evidence has highlighted the well-documented beneficial role of the commensal gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila and its components in promoting host health. However, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated a paradoxical role of A. muciniphila in individuals with various neurological conditions. In this opinion article, we review the correlation between the prevalence of this gut commensal and the development of several disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We focus on the potential mechanisms by which A. muciniphila may contribute to these diseases. An in-depth understanding of these correlations and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms could shed new light on the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and provide a logical rationale for developing new therapies for these neurological conditions.

                Maserumule et al. show that TLR8 senses mycobacterial RNA in macrophage phagosomes, triggering xenophagy to clear Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). TLR8 polymorphisms affect tuberculosis susceptibility, and resiquimod, a TLR8 agonist, enhances clearance of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mtb in vitro and in vivo, offering the potential for therapeutic repurposing.

                Chen et al. reveal that OTUD4 plays a dual role in ferroptosis resistance by stabilizing GPX4 and modulating autophagy. Its inhibition potentiates ferroptosis and enhances regorafenib efficacy, presenting OTUD4 as a compelling target for overcoming therapy resistance in refractory cancers.

                In this study, Jung et al. investigate the effect of excessive NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation on synaptic functions and behaviors using Nlrp3D301N-conditional knockin mice. Strikingly, excessive NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation causes NMDAR hyperactivation, leading to abnormal behaviors. Treatment with IL-1β receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) or NMDAR antagonist reverses the pathological phenotypes.

                Rotariu et al. show that somatostatin (SOM) interneurons mediate cell-specific control of the initial motor learning performance and the associated reorganization of dorsomedial striatum (DMS). This effect is due to an enhanced feedforward inhibition of SOM cells to striatal output neurons induced by early training.

                Aljedaani and Luo et al. reveal that the nuclear-condensate-forming protein EMB1579 regulates stem cell maintenance and cell division in the root meristem. This regulation involves transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and is fine-tuned by physical association to splicing factors. The localization of EMB1579 in nuclear condensates is essential for transcriptional control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95709">Anti-drift pose tracker (ADPT), a transformer-based network for robust animal pose estimation cross-species</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning-based methods have advanced animal pose estimation, enhancing accuracy, and efficiency in quantifying animal behavior. However, these methods frequently experience tracking drift, where noise-induced jumps in body point estimates compromise reliability. Here, we present the anti-drift pose tracker (ADPT), a transformer-based tool that mitigates tracking drift in behavioral analysis. Extensive experiments across cross-species datasets—including proprietary mouse and monkey recordings and public <i>Drosophila</i> and macaque datasets—demonstrate that ADPT significantly reduces drift and surpasses existing models like DeepLabCut and SLEAP in accuracy. Moreover, ADPT achieved 93.16% identification accuracy for 10 unmarked mice and 90.36% accuracy for freely interacting unmarked mice, which can be further refined to 99.72%, enhancing both anti-drift performance and pose estimation accuracy in social interactions. With its end-to-end design, ADPT is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time analysis, offering a robust solution for reproducible animal behavior studies. The ADPT code is available at <a href="https://github.com/tangguoling/ADPT">https://github.com/tangguoling/ADPT</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103615">Shc1 cooperates with Frs2 and Shp2 to recruit Grb2 in FGF-induced lens development</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling elicits multiple downstream pathways, most notably the Ras/MAPK cascade facilitated by the adaptor protein Grb2. However, the mechanism by which Grb2 is recruited to the FGF signaling complex remains unresolved. Here, we showed that genetic ablation of FGF signaling prevented murine lens induction by disrupting transcriptional regulation and actin cytoskeletal arrangements, which could be reproduced by deleting the juxtamembrane region of the FGF receptor and rescued by Kras activation. Conversely, mutations affecting the Frs2-binding site on the FGF receptor or the deletion of Frs2 and Shp2 primarily impact later stages of lens vesicle development involving lens fiber cell differentiation. Our study further revealed that the loss of Grb2 abolished MAPK signaling, resulting in a profound arrest of lens development. However, removing Grb2’s putative Shp2 dephosphorylation site (Y209) neither produced a detectable phenotype nor impaired MAPK signaling during lens development. Furthermore, the catalytically inactive Shp2 mutation (C459S) only modestly impaired FGF signaling, whereas replacing Shp2’s C-terminal phosphorylation sites (Y542/Y580) previously implicated in Grb2 binding only caused placental defects, perinatal lethality, and reduced lacrimal gland branching without impacting lens development, suggesting that Shp2 only partially mediates Grb2 recruitment. In contrast, we observed that FGF signaling is required for the phosphorylation of the Grb2-binding sites on Shc1 and the deletion of Shc1 exacerbates the lens vesicle defect caused by Frs2 and Shp2 deletion. These findings establish Shc1 as a critical collaborator with Frs2 and Shp2 in targeting Grb2 during FGF signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102643">Quantifying feral pig interactions to inform disease transmission networks</a></h4>

              
                Feral pigs threaten biodiversity in 54 countries and cause an estimated $120 billion in damages annually in the USA. They endanger over 600 native species and have driven 14 to extinction. Additionally, they pose a significant zoonotic disease risk, carrying pathogens such as Brucella, leptospirosis, and Japanese encephalitis. Understanding and controlling disease spread relies on models of social dynamics, but these vary widely across regions, limiting the transferability of findings from the USA and Europe to other locations like Australia. This study addresses this gap by analysing the social interactions of 146 GPS-tracked feral pigs in Australia using a proximity-based social network approach. Findings reveal that females exhibit stronger group cohesion, while males act as key connectors between groups. Contact rates are high within groups, facilitating rapid intra-group disease spread, whereas inter-group transmission is slower. Seasonal variations further impact dynamics, with increased contact in summer. These insights suggest that targeting adult males in control programs could help limit disease outbreaks. Given the rising economic and public health concerns associated with animal diseases, the study highlights the need for localized strategies based on feral pig social behaviour to enhance global control efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104011">Emergence of Dip2-mediated specific DAG-based PKC signalling axis in eukaryotes</a></h4>

              
                Diacylglycerols (DAGs) are used for metabolic purposes and are tightly regulated secondary lipid messengers in eukaryotes. DAG subspecies with different fatty-acyl chains are proposed to be involved in the activation of distinct PKC isoforms, resulting in diverse physiological outcomes. However, the molecular players and the regulatory origin for fine-tuning the PKC pathway are unknown. Here, we show that Dip2, a conserved DAG regulator across Fungi and Animalia, has emerged as a modulator of PKC signalling in yeast. Dip2 maintains the level of a specific DAG subpopulation, required for the activation of PKC-mediated cell wall integrity pathway. Interestingly, the canonical DAG-metabolism pathways, being promiscuous, are decoupled from PKC signalling. We demonstrate that these DAG subspecies are sourced from a phosphatidylinositol pool generated by the acyl-chain remodelling pathway. Furthermore, we provide insights into the intimate coevolutionary relationship between the regulator (Dip2) and the effector (PKC) of DAG-based signalling. Hence, our study underscores the establishment of Dip2-PKC axis about 1.2 billion years ago in Opisthokonta, which marks the rooting of the first specific DAG-based signalling module of eukaryotes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101186">Reprograming gene expression in ‘hibernating’ C. elegans involves the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway</a></h4>

              
                In nature, many animals respond to cold by entering hibernation, while in clinical settings, controlled cooling is used in transplantation and emergency medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to survive severe cold are still not fully understood. One key aspect of cold adaptation is the global downregulation of protein synthesis. Studying it in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we find that the translation of most mRNAs continues in the cold, albeit at a slower rate, and propose that cold-specific gene expression is regulated primarily at the transcription level. Supporting this idea, we found that the transcription of certain cold-induced genes is linked to the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) through the conserved IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that this pathway is triggered by cold-induced perturbations in proteins and lipids within the endoplasmic reticulum, and that its activation is beneficial for cold survival.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98287">RAG suppresses group 2 innate lymphoid cells</a></h4>

              
                Antigen specificity is the central trait distinguishing adaptive from innate immune function. Assembly of antigen-specific T cell and B cell receptors occurs through V(D)J recombination mediated by the Recombinase Activating Gene endonucleases RAG1 and RAG2 (collectively called RAG). In the absence of RAG, mature T and B cells do not develop and thus RAG is critically associated with adaptive immune function. In addition to adaptive T helper 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to type 2 immune responses by producing cytokines like Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. Although it has been reported that RAG expression modulates the function of innate natural killer (NK) cells, whether other innate immune cells such as ILC2s are affected by RAG remains unclear. We find that in RAG-deficient mice, ILC2 populations expand and produce increased IL-5 and IL-13 at steady state and contribute to increased inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD)-like disease. Furthermore, we show that RAG modulates ILC2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner independent of the absence or presence of adaptive T and B lymphocytes. Lastly, employing multiomic single cell analyses of RAG1 lineage-traced cells, we identify key transcriptional and epigenomic ILC2 functional programs that are suppressed by a history of RAG expression. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for RAG in modulating innate type 2 immunity through suppression of ILC2s.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101299">The context-dependent epigenetic and organogenesis programs determine 3D vs. 2D cellular fitness of MYC-driven murine liver cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                3D cellular-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic reprogramming is critical to organogenesis and tumorigenesis. Here, we dissect the distinct cell fitness in 2D (normoxia vs. chronic hypoxia) vs 3D (normoxia) culture conditions for an MYC-driven murine liver cancer model. We identify over 600 shared essential genes and additional context-specific fitness genes and pathways. Knockout of the VHL-HIF1 pathway results in incompatible fitness defects under normoxia vs. 1% oxygen or 3D culture conditions. Moreover, deletion of each of the mitochondrial respiratory electron transport chain complex has distinct fitness outcomes. Notably, multicellular organogenesis signaling pathways including TGFβ-SMAD, which is upregulated in 3D culture, specifically constrict the uncontrolled cell proliferation in 3D while inactivation of epigenetic modifiers (<i>Bcor</i>, <i>Kmt2d</i>, <i>Mettl3,</i> and <i>Mettl14</i>) has opposite outcomes in 2D vs. 3D. We further identify a 3D-dependent synthetic lethality with partial loss of <i>Prmt5</i> due to a reduction of <i>Mtap</i> expression resulting from 3D-specific epigenetic reprogramming. Our study highlights unique epigenetic, metabolic, and organogenesis signaling dependencies under different cellular settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99717">Differences in size and number of embryonic type II neuroblast lineages correlate with divergent timing of central complex development between beetle and fly</a></h4>

              
                The insect brain and the timing of its development underwent evolutionary adaptations. However, little is known about the underlying developmental processes. The central complex of the brain is an excellent model to understand neural development and divergence. It is produced in large parts by type II neuroblasts, which produce intermediate progenitors, another type of cycling precursor, to increase their neural progeny. Type II neuroblasts lineages are believed to be conserved among insects, but little is known on their molecular characteristics in insects other than flies. <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> has emerged as a model for brain development and evolution. However, type II neuroblasts have so far not been studied in this beetle. We created a fluorescent enhancer trap marking expression of <i>Tc-fez/earmuff</i>, a key marker for intermediate progenitors. Using combinatorial labeling of further markers, including <i>Tc-pointed,</i> we characterized embryonic type II neuroblast lineages. Intriguingly, we found nine lineages per hemisphere in the <i>Tribolium</i> embryo while <i>Drosophila</i> produces only eight per brain hemisphere. These embryonic lineages are significantly larger in <i>Tribolium</i> than they are in <i>Drosophila</i> and contain more intermediate progenitors. Finally, we mapped these lineages to the domains of head patterning genes. Notably, <i>Tc-otd</i> is absent from all type II neuroblasts and intermediate progenitors, whereas <i>Tc-six3</i> marks an anterior subset of the type II lineages. <i>Tc-six4</i> specifically marks the territory where anterior-medial type II neuroblasts differentiate. In conclusion, we identified a conserved pattern of gene expression in holometabolan central complex forming type II neuroblast lineages, and conserved head patterning genes emerged as new candidates for conferring spatial identity to individual lineages. The higher number and greater lineage size of the embryonic type II neuroblasts in the beetle correlate with a previously described embryonic phase of central complex formation. These findings stipulate further research on the link between stem cell activity and temporal and structural differences in central complex development.

">Structural Interactions of Ankyrin B with NrCAM and β2 Spectrin</a></h4>

              
                Ank2 is a high confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene encoding the spectrin-actin scaffold protein Ankyrin B (AnkB). The 220 kDal isoform of AnkB has multiple functions including developmental spine pruning through L1 family cell adhesion molecules (L1-CAMs) and class 3 Semaphorins on dendrites of pyramidal neurons to achieve an appropriate excitatory balance in the neocortex. Molecular modeling employing AlphaFold was used to predict the structure and interactions of AnkB with the cytoplasmic domain of Neuron-glial Related L1-CAM (NrCAM), and with {beta}2-Spectrin. The validity of the models was assessed by analyzing protein-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cell lysates after mutating key residues in AnkB predicted to impair these associations. Results revealed a pocket with critical residues in the AnkB membrane-binding domain that engages NrCAM at the conserved cytoplasmic motif FIGQY. Alphafold modeling of the AnkB/{beta}2-Spectrin complex also identified key interactions between the AnkB spectrin-binding domain and {beta}2-Spectrin repeats 14-15. Selected ASD-linked mutations in AnkB predicted to impact binding to NrCAM or {beta}2-Spectrin were then assayed for protein interactions. Maternally inherited ASD missense mutations AnkB A368G located in the NrCAM binding pocket and AnkB R977Q in the Zu51 subdomain disrupted associations with NrCAM and {beta}2-Spectrin, respectively. Moreover, AnkB A368G impaired the neuronal function of 220 kDal AnkB in Semaphorin 3F-induced spine pruning in mouse cortical neuron cultures. These new findings provide structural insights into the L1-CAM/AnkB complex and the molecular basis of ASD etiology associated with AnkB missense mutations.

                Dysregulated RNA metabolism is a significant feature of Alzheimers disease (AD), yet how post-transcriptional RNA modifications like N6-ethyladenosine (m6A) are altered in AD is unknown. Here, we performed deamination adjacent to RNA modification targets (DART-seq) on human dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to assess changes in m6A with nucleotide resolution. In non-AD brains, m6A sites increased with age, predominantly within the 3UTR of transcripts encoding tripartite synapse proteins. In contrast, AD brains lost the age-associated m6A site increase and exhibited global hypomethylation of transcripts, including MAPT and APP. Hypomethylated genes involved with GABAergic signaling, glutamate transport, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis exhibited reduced expression, connecting m6A to synaptic excitotoxicity and disrupted proteostasis in AD. Site-specific m6A levels were linked with GABRA1 expression and protein levels, but this relationship was abolished in AD. Our findings provide insight into post-transcriptional mechanisms of dysregulated RNA metabolism in AD that are related to aging and GABAergic regulation.

">Mycobacterial Phenolic Glycolipid Triggers ATP-Mediated Neuronal P2X3 Signaling and Cough</a></h4>

              
                Cough drives respiratory pathogen transmission, yet how microbes directly engage host sensory neurons to trigger cough is largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) activates neurons and induces cough. Here, we reveal that phenolic glycolipid (PGL) produced by the hypertransmissible HN878 Mtb strain activates both mouse and human nociceptive neurons in vitro using calcium imaging and electrophysiology and is sufficient to induce cough using plethysmography. Combined with SL-1, PGL potently triggers neuronal activation. By synthesizing various PGL analogs, we show that neuroactivity is proportional to saccharide chain length and structure. Mechanistically, PGL stimulates rapid extracellular ATP release, which engages neuronal P2X3 purinergic receptors - an effect blocked by a P2X3 antagonist. These findings uncover a neuronal activation pathway co-opted by certain Mtb strains to enhance transmission via cough and suggest inhibition of purinergic signaling as a potential strategy to block airborne spread of Mtb.

                The cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to neuronal death after a focal ischemic stroke remains enigmatic. Although astrocytes form glial barriers that may protect surrounding tissue, how barriers develop and contribute to neuronal death is unclear. Here, we show that H2O2 induces astrocytic type I collagen (COL1) production via miR-29 mediated post-transcriptional and fucosylation-dependent post-translational regulations, leading to integrin activation and neuronal death. In photothrombosis (PT)-induced cortical stroke model, PT triggered H2O2 surge, astrogliosis, glial barrier formation, COL1 expression, fibrotic scarring, altered N-glycosylation, neuronal loss, and neurological deficits. Remarkably, these effects were reversed by astrocyte-specific COL1 or FUT8 gene-silencing or treatment with KDS12025, an H2O2 decomposing peroxidase enhancer. KDS12025s neuroprotective effects were also recapitulated in non-human primate stroke model. These findings delineate a previously unrecognized astrocyte-driven mechanism in which oxidative stress induces COL1 production, promoting neuronal death, and position H2O2 and astrocytic COL1 and FUT8 as promising therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.

">An in vivo model for transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex in awake mice.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique mainly used in humans, in which weak direct currents are applied over the scalp to alter cortical excitability and induce neuroplasticity. Previous studies have demonstrated the value of tDCS for modulating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, nevertheless, knowledge about how externally applied electric fields affect different components of neuronal networks is still incomplete, and in vivo animal models, which are required for a deeper understanding, are not fully developed. To evaluate the impact of tDCS on cortical excitability, many human experiments assess motor evoked potentials elicited by motor cortex (M1) stimulation. To develop a related in vivo animal model, we recorded electrical activity in M1 of alert mice during and after administration of tDCS over M1. M1 excitability was chronically recorded from layers 2-3, layer 5 and layer 6, evoked by stimulation of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VAL). M1-tDCS was applied at 100 and 200 A for 5 s to test the acute effects on neuronal excitability, and for 15 min to induce after-effects. Acute M1-tDCS increased and decreased the amplitude of VAL-evoked potentials in a polarity-, layer- and intensity-dependent manner. For 15 minutes of anodal or cathodal tDCS, a similar polarity- and intensity-dependent modulation of VAL-evoked potential amplitudes during the 15 minutes of stimulation was observed. After tDCS was switched off, the highest intensity of anodal stimulation induced a significant excitability enhancement during at least two hours after stimulation, whereas the after-effects of cathodal tDCS were less pronounced. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of a mouse model of M1-tDCS to accomplish similar modulatory effects of tDCS on cortical excitability as observed in human experiments. A proper adjustment of tDCS parameters, as compared to application in humans, is however required to obtain these translational effects.

It remains unclear what the temporal dynamics are of this generalization, and to which processing stages it is linked. Here we investigated the neural correlates of peripherally encoded memoranda before and after an item was selected for response, focusing on when the representation changes from a location-specific to a spatially generalized code. Thirty healthy participants memorized two orientations presented serially at 15 degrees eccentricity to the left and right of central fixation. One of the two items was subsequently cued, for which memory performance was then assessed. During the delays between each of these events, impulse signals were presented to trace memoranda in potentially activity-silent or activity-reduced states. Replicating prior findings, we observed that neural codes transitioned from dynamic, location-specific states to spatially and temporally generalized stable states post-encoding, here emerging from about 400 ms onwards. Importantly, this already occurred during maintenance, prior to selection of the response-relevant item. After the cue, first the location, and then the identity of the cued item emerged in the signal, suggesting that, despite the by then generalized code, location remained a useful basis for selection. The results suggest that spatial generalization is predominantly a maintenance-related rather than a selection-related process.

">The Optimal Retinal Locus for High-Resolution Vision in Space and Time</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit machine-like eye-movement behavior in space and time while performing challenging visual resolution tasks. Fewer microsaccades occur as stimulus presentation is imminent. Drifts and microsaccades combine to confine the landing location of an anticipated visual stimulus to a tiny retinal region: the preferred retinal locus (PRL). We find that this location confers the best visual acuity despite it being offset from the anatomical fovea (the location of maximum cone density). We also find that acuity is best when the last microsaccade occurs ~400msec or longer before stimulus presentation. The machine-like eye movements are involuntary and not perceived. Our findings thus reveal a highly evolved oculomotor system such that gaze direction during fixation is rarely far enough from the PRL to cause a decline in visual resolution.

">Integrative Single-Cell Analysis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Animal Models Reveal Convergent Transcriptomic Dysregulation Involved in Excitatory-Inhibitory Imbalance and Glial Disfunction</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents profound clinical and etiological heterogeneity, complicating the identification of core pathophysiological mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers cellular resolution but integrating findings across diverse studies remains challenging. Here, we constructed a unified single-cell reference framework by integrating scRNA-seq data from 11 distinct genetic and environmental ASD animal models, encompassing over 300.000 cells across various brain regions and developmental stages. Comparative analyses revealed convergent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across neuronal and glial populations. Cross-model comparisons validated the integration, showing significant concordance between the unified dataset and individual studies, particularly for neuronal populations, and demonstrating how environmental models like valproic acid exposure recapitulate some of the transcriptomic alterations seen in genetic models. Cell communication analyses support widespread excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and with predicted signaling involving ligands like Pdgfa and Reln. Furthermore, we identified significant glial dysfunction, notably downregulation of crucial functional genes in astrocytes and signatures of metabolic dysregulation in mature oligodendrocytes. Cross-referencing with the SFARI database confirmed significant overlap with high-confidence ASD risk genes, with notable dysregulated in specific cell types included Ermn (upregulated in multiple glia), Foxg1 (downregulated in L5/6 NP neurons) and Mef2c (downregulated in MEIS2-like interneurons). Comparison with human scRNA-seq postmortem data revealed conserved dysregulation, highlighting enrichment of presynaptic/postsynaptic translation processes in neurons (implicating CACNAIA, GRIN2B, CAMK2A, ribosomal proteins) along with enrichment for neurodevelopmental disorder pathways in mature oligodendrocytes, involving NRXN and DLGAP gene networks. This integrative study provides unprecedented insight into the convergent cellular and molecular pathologies underlying ASD, establishing a valuable resource for understanding shared mechanisms and identifying new potential therapeutic targets.

                <p>Seizures affect a large proportion of the global population and occur due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain. Unfortunately, widespread genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity contributes to insufficient treatment options. It is critical to identify the genetic underpinnings of how seizures occur to better understand seizure disorders and improve therapeutic development. We used the <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> model to identify that IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp) is linked to the onset of this phenotype. Specific reduction of Imp in neurons causes seizures after mechanical stimulation. Importantly, gross motor behavior is unaffected, showing Imp loss does not affect general neuronal activity. Developmental loss of Imp is sufficient to cause seizures in adults; thus, Imp-modulated neuron development affects mature neuronal function. Since Imp is an RNA-binding protein, we sought to identify the mRNA target that Imp regulates in neurons to ensure proper neuronal activity after mechanical stress. We find that the Imp protein binds <I>Syndecan</I> (<I>Sdc</I>) mRNA, and the reduction of Sdc also causes mechanically induced seizures. Expression of Sdc in <I>Imp</I>-deficient neurons rescues seizure defects, showing that Sdc is sufficient to restore normal behavior after mechanical stress. We suggest that the Imp protein binds <I>Sdc</I> mRNA in neurons, and this functional interaction is important for normal neuronal biology and animal behavior in a mechanically induced seizure model. Since Imp and Sdc are conserved, our work highlights a neuronal-specific pathway that might contribute to seizure disorder when mutated in humans.</p>

                <p>Research that combines advanced technological devices with complex behavioral tasks has enabled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying brain and behavioral states. Freely moving rodent experiments often require a tether&mdash;a wired connection between an implanted device and an external power supply or data acquisition system. Traditionally, these experiments have used passive commutators to manage tethers, but such setups are often inadequate for reducing twisting and mechanical strain during behavioral tasks. Existing motorized commutators have extended the range of motion for these experiments but generally rely on stepper motors that produce auditory noise, potentially interfering with behavior. To address these limitations, we developed the Motor Assisted Commutator to Harness Electronics in Tethered Experiments (MACHETE), a motor-assisted commutator featuring a low-noise brushless motor. MACHETE dynamically adjusts tethers based on mouse movement, reducing torque and mechanical strain, and minimizing the animal's physical exertion during behavioral assays. Its onboard microcontroller provides customizable controls and seamless integration with custom electronic devices. The design includes a central through-hole to accommodate wires or fibers from external devices such as head-mounted miniature microscopes, electrophysiology probes, and optogenetics systems. We validated MACHETE across standard behavioral assays, including the open field test, the splash test, and the three-chamber social test. Our results showed no significant changes in mobility or behavior compared with untethered controls. By combining precise motor control, low auditory noise equipment, and accessibility, MACHETE can be used to support research that aims to adapt tools for use in freely moving behavior experiments.</p>

                <p>by William Gilpin</p>

Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.

                <p>by Fenglian Pan, You Zhou, Carolina Vivas-Valencia, Nan Kong, Carol Ott, Mohammad S Jalali, Jian Liu</p>

Substance use disorder, particularly opioid-related, is a serious public health challenge in the U.S. Accurately predicting opioid overdose events and stratifying the risk of having such an event are critical for healthcare providers to deliver effective interventions in patients with opioid overdose. Despite a large body of literature investigating various risk factors for the prediction, the existing research to date has not explicitly investigated and quantitatively modeled how an individual’s past opioid overdose events affect future occurrences. In this paper, we proposed a covariate-adjusted triggering point process to simultaneously model the effect of various risk factors on opioid overdose events and the triggering mechanism among opioid overdose events. The prediction performance was assessed by the U.S. state-wise Medicaid reimbursement claims data. Compared with commonly used prediction models, the proposed model achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Errors and Mean Absolute Percentage Errors on 30-, 60-, 90, 120-, 150-, and 180-day-ahead predictions. In addition, our results showed the statistical significance of considering the triggering mechanism for recurrent opioid overdose events prediction. On average, around 47% of the event recurrence were explained by the triggering mechanism.

                <p>by Lenka Kopfová, Josef Tkadlec</p>

Moran Birth-death process is a standard stochastic process that is used to model natural selection in spatially structured populations. A newly occurring mutation that invades a population of residents can either fixate on the whole population or it can go extinct due to random drift. The duration of the process depends not only on the total population size <i>n</i>, but also on the spatial structure of the population. In this work, we consider the Moran process with a single type of individuals who invade and colonize an otherwise empty environment. Mathematically, this corresponds to the setting where the residents have zero reproduction rate, thus they never reproduce. The spatial structure is represented by a graph. We present two main contributions. First, in contrast to the Moran process in which residents do reproduce, we show that the colonization time is always at most a polynomial function of the population size <i>n</i>. Namely, we show that colonization always takes at most 12n3−12n2 expected steps, and for each <i>n</i>, we identify the slowest graph where it takes exactly that many steps. Moreover, we establish a stronger bound of roughly n2.5 steps for undirected graphs and an even stronger bound of roughly n2 steps for so-called regular graphs. Second, we discuss various complications that one faces when attempting to measure fixation times and colonization times in spatially structured populations, and we propose to measure the real duration of the process, rather than counting the steps of the classic Moran process.

                <p>by Peter Methys Degen, Matúš Medo</p>

The high-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of transcriptomics data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments poses a challenge to routine downstream analysis steps, such as differential expression analysis and enrichment analysis. Additionally, due to practical and financial constraints, RNA-Seq experiments are often limited to a small number of biological replicates. In light of recent studies on the low replicability of preclinical cancer research, it is essential to understand how the combination of population heterogeneity and underpowered cohort sizes affects the replicability of RNA-Seq research. Using 18’000 subsampled RNA-Seq experiments based on real gene expression data from 18 different data sets, we find that differential expression and enrichment analysis results from underpowered experiments are unlikely to replicate well. However, low replicability does not necessarily imply low precision of results, as data sets exhibit a wide range of possible outcomes. In fact, 10 out of 18 data sets achieve high median precision despite low recall and replicability for cohorts with more than five replicates. To assist researchers constrained by small cohort sizes in estimating the expected performance regime of their data sets, we provide a simple bootstrapping procedure that correlates strongly with the observed replicability and precision metrics. We conclude with practical recommendations to alleviate problems with underpowered RNA-Seq studies.

                <p>by Elaine A. Ferguson, Ahmed Lugelo, Anna Czupryna, Danni Anderson, Felix Lankester, Lwitiko Sikana, Jonathan Dushoff, Katie Hampson</p>

Vaccination programs are the mainstay of control for many infectious diseases. Heterogeneous coverage is hypothesized to reduce vaccination program effectiveness, but this impact has not been quantified in real systems. We address this gap using fine-scale data from two decades of rabies contact tracing and dog vaccination campaigns in Serengeti district, Tanzania. We also aimed to identify drivers of the continued circulation of rabies in the district despite annual vaccination campaigns. Using generalized linear mixed models, we find that current focal (village-level) dog rabies incidence decreases with increasing recent focal vaccination coverage. However, current focal incidence depends most on recent incidence, both focally and in the wider district, consistent with high population connectivity. Removing the masking effects of prior non-focal incidence shows that, for the same average prior non-focal (wider-district) vaccination coverage, increased heterogeneity in coverage among the non-focal villages leads to increased focal incidence. These effects led to outbreaks following years when vaccination campaigns missed many villages, whereas when heterogeneity in coverage was reduced, incidence declined to low levels (<0.4 cases/1,000 dogs annually and no human deaths) and short vaccination lapses thereafter did not lead to resurgence. Through transmission-tree reconstruction, we inferred frequent incursions into the district each year (mean of 7). Inferred incursions substantially increased as a percentage of all cases in recent years, reaching 50% in 2022, suggesting regional connectivity is driving residual transmission. Overall, we empirically demonstrate how population connectivity and spatial heterogeneity in vaccination can impact disease outcomes, highlighting the importance of fine-scale monitoring in managing vaccination programs.

                Gozashti et al. investigate the molecular origins of chromosomal inversions by comparing de novo genome assemblies of deer mice (species Peromyscus maniculatus). They find that genomic repeats, including transposable elements, segmental duplications, and centromeric satellites, are enriched at inversion breakpoints and likely play a role in facilitating these rearrangements.

Inhibition of EZH2 with tazemetostat enhances MHC class I expression, improves CTL-mediated elimination, and reduces HIV reservoir seeding in vivo. These findings support clinical evaluation of tazemetostat as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for HIV cure.

                Arekar et al. demonstrate that the hepatic hormone hepcidin is essential for resistance to disseminated candidiasis. Hepcidin deficiency and associated iron overload result in inexorable fungal growth and unrestricted hyphal transformation with exposed 1,3-β-glucan to drive organ pathology independent of candidalysin. This is rescued by a synthetic hepcidin mimetic.

                Wang et al. demonstrate the [DE]nX1-2FXX[FL]XXXR motif, uniquely present in the N terminus of ALA1 homologous proteins in Brassicaceae species, interact with β appendage of AP-2 to facilitate vesicle formation. DON-induced C-terminal phosphorylation of ALA1 drives DON-associated vesicle trafficking. Their study highlights P4-ATPase-mediated vesicle-vacuole trafficking for mycotoxin detoxification and FHB resistance.

">Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Flexibility and Interference Control in a Stroop Task Switching Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Task-switching paradigms, often used to study cognitive flexibility, frequently employ incongruent bivalent stimuli, triggering two tasks and potentially conflating cognitive flexibility with interference control. This study assesses cognitive flexibility using univalent stimuli (triggering one task) and congruent bivalent stimuli (same response across tasks) in a modified Stroop task to investigate well-established neural activity correlates of cognitive flexibility, manifested in human (females and males) electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, while isolating switch process from the influence of interference control at the response level. In particular, we analyzed EEG theta-band activity and event-related potential (ERP) components in switch (N2, P3a, P3b, late sustained potential (LSP)) and interference (N400, LSP and mid-frontal theta activity) conditions. We compared each of the switch and the interference condition to the control condition using cluster-based permutation test. In the switch condition, we observed fronto-central N2, reduced frontal P3a, and a positive occipital LSP. The interference condition showed increased frontal theta, parietal N400, and a positive occipital LSP. We also compared switch and interference conditions using cluster-based permutation test. We observed a larger N2 in the frontocentral regions during the switch condition and higher frontal theta activity during the interference condition, which aligns with their comparisons to the control condition. This result suggests that distinct neural mechanisms are used for each of the processes involved in conflict monitoring. Specifically, the theta activity may reflect sustained monitoring and conflict resolution during interference, while the N2 may reflect more transient conflict detection and the need to switch task sets.

                Constitutive activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) plays an important role in brain function and disease including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The non-visual opsin Opn7b is a constitutively active Gi/o coupled GPCR which has been used to synchronize neuronal networks. Here we show that expression of Opn7b in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the ventral tegmental area, two interconnected brain areas involved in modulating fear and stress responses, reduces the number of cFos positive neurons and modulates avoidance behavior in mice. Thus, by constitutively activating the Gi/o pathway Opn7b can be used as a tool to reduce cFos expression and to link cFos-expressing neurons to network- and pathway-specific behavior.

">A network of face patches in human prefrontal cortex for social processing of faces</a></h4>

              
                The human cerebral cortex contains localized regions for processing faces. These regions or patches, which are classically found in the occipito-temporal cortex, encode visual properties of faces. Using naturalistic movie-watching fMRI data from 176 human subjects and multivariate functional connectivity analysis, here we comprehensively characterize a novel network of four frontal face patches (FFPs) arranged dorsoventrally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. FFPs are strongly coupled with a face-selective region in the middle superior temporal sulcus, appear to be primarily involved in processing high-level social aspects of faces during movie-watching, and show partial correlations of activity with distinct cognitive networks. Activations in FFPs are correlated with the performance of subjects in a social cognition task. We further identify two groups of subjects who showed a remarkable difference in the topographical organization of FFPs. The discovery of FFPs provides new insights into the understanding of social processing in the brain.

">The Slowest Timescales of Neural Synchronization Reveal the Strongest Influence of Auditory Distraction</a></h4>

              
                Among all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences that vary across three orders of magnitude, from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. Here, we developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds. Target sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25-80 Hz), envelope changes (~5 Hz), and slower changes in embedded context reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable levels of distraction: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously and independently measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task. Sustained shifts from random to regular arrangements of temporal sequences were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions (<10Hz) of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of a more distracting sound while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope modulation rate were unaffected by varying levels of distraction. Categorizing trials according to task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials. By designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the remarkable temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes in the 7-10 Hz alpha range that has been linked to distractor suppression, which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.

">Differential Astrocyte-supplied NMDAR Co-Agonist for CA1 versus Dentate Gyrus Long-term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                In the hippocampus, there is a region and synapse-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) co-agonist preference for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses, enriched in GluN2A-containing NMDARs, favor D-serine, while medial perforant path (MPP) to dentate gyrus (DG) synapses that are rich in GluN2B-containing NMDARs prefer glycine for LTP induction. This study investigated the role of astrocytes in providing these co-agonists. We confirmed in rat hippocampal slices that exogenous D-serine (10 M) is sufficient to restore LTP at SC-CA1 synapses blocked under astrocyte calcium (Ca2+) -clamp conditions, consistent with previous findings. However, exogenous glycine (10 M) also rescued the LTP. In contrast, at MPP-DG synapses, 100 M exogenous glycine, but not 10 M nor 100 M D-serine, restored the LTP blocked by astrocyte Ca2+-clamping. Our findings support the view that, as for serine in CA1, astrocytes are the cellular source of the glycine required for LTP induction at MPP-DG synapses.

">Distinct roles of neuronal phenotypes during neurofeedback adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Learning adaptation allows the brain to refine motor patterns in response to changing environments rapidly. While population-level neural dynamics and single-neuron activity in motor learning have been widely studied, the contributions of individual neuron types remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a brain-machine interface (BMI) task with perturbations of varying difficulty to investigate single-neuron dynamics underlying neurofeedback adaptation in two rhesus macaques. Cortical neurons were classified based on waveform shape into narrow waveform (NW) and broad waveform (BW) categories, representing putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively. Compared to BW neurons, NW neurons were more active and more strongly involved in the learning process. Moreover, task difficulty modulated neural responsiveness and coordination within both neuron groups, highlighting differential neuron engagement during motor learning. Our findings provide novel insights into single-neuron mechanisms underlying neurofeedback adaptation and emphasize the distinct functional roles of neuronal phenotypes in rapid learning processes.

">Dynamics of auditory word form encoding in human speech cortex</a></h4>

              
                When we hear continuous speech, we perceive it as a series of discrete words, despite the lack of clear boundaries in the acoustic signal. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) encodes phonetic elements like consonants and vowels, but how it extracts whole words as perceptual units remains unclear. Using high-density cortical recordings, we investigated how the brain represents auditory word forms - integrating acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical features - while participants listened to spoken narratives. Our results show that STG neural populations exhibit a distinctive reset in activity at word boundaries, marked by a brief, sharp drop in cortical activity. Between these resets, the STG consistently encodes distinct acoustic-phonetic, prosodic, and lexical information, supporting the integration of phonological features into coherent word forms. Notably, this process tracks the relative elapsed time within each word, independent of its absolute duration, providing a flexible temporal scaffolding for encoding variable word lengths. We observed similar word form dynamics in the deeper layers of a self-supervised artificial speech network, suggesting a potential convergence with computational models. Additionally, in a bistable word perception task, STG responses were aligned with participants' perceived word boundaries on a trial-by-trial basis, further emphasizing the role of dynamic encoding in word recognition. Together, these findings support a new dynamical model of auditory word forms, highlighting their importance as perceptual units for accessing linguistic meaning.

">Age-specific regulation of sociability by hypothalamic Agrp neurons</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation enhances sociability, suggesting that social behavior is maintained through a homeostatic mechanism. Further, mammalian social needs shift dramatically from infancy through adolescence into adulthood, raising the question of whether the neural mechanisms governing this homeostatic regulation evolve across developmental stages. Here, we show that agouti-related peptide (Agrp) neurons, which regulate hunger in adults, are activated by social isolation from weaning through adolescence but not in adulthood. Importantly, the activity of these neurons is critical for social behavior during adolescence: inhibiting Agrp neurons reduced isolation-induced sociability in juveniles but not in adults, and Agrp neuron activation promoted sociability only in young mice. After isolation, reunion with siblings or other conspecifics, but not unfamiliar adult males, rapidly decreased neuronal activity in juveniles, an effect requiring intact olfaction. These findings identify Agrp neurons as a key component of the circuitry governing age-specific social homeostasis.

">Nociceptin Orphanin F/Q Pathways are Dysregulated by Stress and Modulate Reward Learning and Motivation Across Species</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptin orphanin F/Q has been implicated in stress-related depressive phenotypes. Specifically, exposure to chronic stressors upregulates nociceptin receptors (NOPR), whereas NOPR antagonism has anti-depressant/anti-anhedonic effects. The mechanisms underlying these effects remain, however, unclear. Here, we investigated the role of NOPR in depressive phenotypes alongside potentially prohedonic effects of NOPR antagonism across species. In Study 1, we evaluated whether exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) upregulated ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatal prepronociceptin (Pnoc) gene expression in adult mice. In Study 2, we tested whether chronic social defeat altered Pnoc gene expression in reward-related regions. To establish whether direct NOPR modulation is implicated in reward-related behaviors, in Study 3, we assessed whether NOPR antagonism alters reward learning in rats. Finally, in Study 4, we tested whether NOPR antagonism boosts motivation among depressed humans. ELA induced anhedonic behavior and increased Pnoc expression in the VTA; in females (but not males), ELA increased Pnoc expression in the dorsal striatum (Study 1). Furthermore, chronic stress reduced Pnoc-expressing cells in the VTA, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex and susceptible rats showed reduced VTA NOPR gene (Oprl1)-expressing cells (Study 2). In a behavioral assay, a single 30-mg dose of a NOPR antagonist (BTRX-246040) boosted reward learning in rats (Study 3). Finally, in depressed humans, relative to placebo, 8-week treatment with BTRX-246040 increased incentive motivation (Study 4). Collectively, our findings indicate that chronic stressors alter Pnoc and mRNA levels of Pnoc-expressing cells in a sex-selective and region-specific manner impacting reward structures, and that NOPR antagonism shows anti-anhedonic properties.

">Development of Auditory and Spontaneous Movement Responses to Music over the First Year of Life</a></h4>

              
                Humans across cultures not only share the ability to recognise music but also respond to it through movement. While the sensory encoding of music is well-studied, when and how infants naturally start moving to music is largely unexplored. This study simultaneously investigates infants neural (auditory) responses and spontaneous movements to music during the first year of life. Neural activity (EEG) and body kinematics (markerless pose estimation) were recorded from 79 infants (aged 3, 6, and 12 months) listening to refrains of childrens music, along with shuffled, high-pitched, and low-pitched versions of the same songs. Neural data revealed that, across all ages, infants exhibit enhanced auditory responses to music compared to shuffled music, indicating that auditory encoding of music emerges early in development. Movement data revealed a different outcome. While coarse auditory-motor coupling is present at all ages, more complex structured movement patterns emerge in response to music only by 12 months. Notably, no age group demonstrated evidence of coordinated movements to music. Additionally, enhanced auditory responses to high vs low pitch were only evident at 6 months, while infants movements were better predicted by high-pitched compared to low-pitched music at all ages. This study provides initial insights into how the developing brain gradually transforms music into spontaneous movements of increasing complexity.

">Hyper-Glycosylation as a Central Metabolic Driver of Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by devastating degenerative decline. Metabolic disruptions are widely observed, yet their involvement in the molecular etiology of AD remains underexplored. Utilizing spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics in both mouse models and human post-mortem samples, we identified a hyper-glycosylation phenotype as a hallmark of AD. To investigate the underlying mechanisms and whether the observed effect was a driver of the observed decline, we developed an advanced spatial isotopic tracing pulse-chase method to study the dynamics of N-linked glycans. Our analysis revealed enhanced glycan biosynthesis in AD mouse models. Based on these findings, we performed genetic and dietary interventions to modulate glycan biosynthesis. Genetic knockdown of glycan biosynthetic enzymes ameliorated the hyper-glycosylation and improved cognitive and behavioral outcomes in AD mice. In contrast, oral glucosamine supplementation drove hyper-glycosylation and exacerbated cognitive and behavioral deficits. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a large population of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) stratified by glucosamine use, leveraging electronic health records. Consistently, glucosamine supplementation was associated with increased mortality in AD and ADRD patient cohorts, and significantly elevated progression from MCI to AD compared to age-matched controls. Collectively, our findings establish hyper-glycosylation as a pathological driver of AD and highlight glycan metabolism as an actional target in the fight against AD.

">Brain glucodynamic variability is an essential feature of the metabolism-cognition relationship</a></h4>

              
                Variability ensures that complex biological systems, including the brain, are capable of responding to changing environmental demands. While the importance of neural variability in electrophysiological and haemodynamic aspects of brain activity is beginning to be understood, little is known about how variability in molecular activity influences brain function. Here we examine how temporal variability in glucodynamics, or time-varying glucose use, is related to cognition in 35 younger and 43 older adults. Stationary metabolic rates of glucose were not directly associated with cognition. Rather, higher glucodynamic variability, and its coherence into metabolic networks, was associated with better cognitive performance. Lower glucodynamic variability in ageing was associated with altered metabolic network efficiency and reduced cognitive performance. Our results demonstrate for the first time that variability in cerebral glucose metabolism is biologically and functionally relevant to cognition and the network architecture of the brain. Cognition is influenced by time-varying glucose metabolism and its coherent fluctuations in metabolic networks. A loss of glucodynamics in ageing reduces the efficiency of the metabolic connectome and contributes to reduced cognitive performance. The study of glucodynamics significantly advances our understanding of metabolic brain changes in health, ageing and disease.

">State and trait measures of attention predict performance in video-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Impaired academic performance is often attributed to attentional deficits, but it remains unclear whether these reflect long-term traits or momentary fluctuations in attention. This study investigated how acute attention during engaging educational videos and trait measures of attention influenced test taking performance. Short-term retention was assessed in 152 students across four experiments using short-form educational videos. Behavioral trait measures of inattention, hyperactivity, and working memory capacity were also obtained. Acute attention, measured by EEG during video viewing, was a strong predictor of test scores. In contrast, self-reported trait measures of attention were not significant predictors. Working memory capacity and GPA positively predicted test scores. Inattention traits predicted GPA, suggesting a negative effect on overall academic performance. These results suggest that attentional traits only weakly and indirectly affect student performance. Modifying teaching methods, may help address learning deficits in inattentive students, who seem to have no problem attending to, and retaining the content of short, engaging educational videos.

">Vascular dysfunction in Huntington's disease is located at the blood-CSF barrier and is rescued by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist</a></h4>

              
                Brain vascular barriers are dysfunctional in many neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), but which vessels are affected and how remains unclear. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in R6/2 HD-model mice, we reveal a striking divergence in barrier dysfunction. Surface vessels of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) drive pathology by paracellular leakage, while parenchymal vessels of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) exhibit increased transport via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), with arterioles being the most susceptible segment. The pathology of both barriers coincided with astrocyte activation localized to affected vessels in R6/2 mice, as well as post-mortem HD human brains. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) agonist treatment rescued BCSFB leakage but only partially restored BBB function, selectively reducing AMT in arterioles, with no effect in capillaries and venules. These findings redefine HD vascular pathology, demonstrating heterogeneous, vessel-type-specific barrier failure beyond generalized "disruption," uncovering mechanistic vulnerabilities and the therapeutic potential of S1PR1 modulation.

">Episodic events are flexibility encoded in both integrated and separated neural representations</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates how the brain encodes episodic events to support diverse memory functions. Thirty-six participants viewed movies simulating real-life interactions while EEG was recorded. They first watched movies featuring two characters (AB), followed by scenes where one original character interacted with a new one (BC). Memory was assessed for direct (AB and BC), indirect (AC) associations, and source memory about whether two characters had appeared together. Source memory was more accurate when participants correctly inferred indirect associations. Time-resolved representational similarity analysis (RSA) of EEG data revealed both neural pattern similarities and dissimilarities during AB and BC encoding. Pattern similarities, indicating memory integration across episodes, predicted successful indirect associations. Conversely, dissimilarities predicted accurate source memory, indicating the preservation of distinct memory traces. These findings suggest that episodic events are flexibly encoded through both integrated and segregated neural representations, enabling the brain to support multiple memory functions depending on task demands.

">Alpha activity during verbal working memory retention depends on the stimulus presentation mode</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies of verbal working memory (WM) have reported inconsistent changes in alpha power during retention, with both increases and decreases observed. We asked whether these discrepancies arise from how stimuli are presented. Thirty adults memorized seven digits presented in four modes: Simultaneous (all digits for 2800 ms) or sequential presentations at Fast (400 ms per digit), Slow (1000 ms per digit), and Fast+delay (400 ms per digit plus a 600 ms free time in between). We analyzed EEG during encoding and a 6 s retention period in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (18-24 Hz) frequency bands. Recall accuracy was highest in the Simultaneous mode and lowest in the Fast mode, yet these two conditions did not differ in any frequency band during encoding or retention. Encoding produced parametric load-related theta increase and beta decrease, possibly reflecting growing executive control demands and motor program formation, respectively. Alpha power did not scale with load during encoding. During retention, theta and beta during retention were unaffected by presentation mode. Alpha power did not differ significantly when all sequential modes were grouped together compared to the simultaneous mode. However, the Fast+delay mode uniquely showed below-baseline alpha in the first half of the retention. Our findings suggest that alpha dynamics are sensitive to the temporal structure of encoding and retention periods, particularly the presence or absence of free intervals between stimulus presentations. We propose that alpha modulation during WM retention may reflect processes beyond the simple gating of irrelevant sensory information.

">Predicting individual differences of fear and cognitive learning and extinction</a></h4>

              
                The abilities to acquire new information and to modify previously learned knowledge are critical in an ever-changing world. However, the efficacy of learning is notably variable among individuals, with extinction learning being the epitome of such variability. Abundant studies have identified a core network of brain regions including amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and, more recently, the cerebellum, as key players in learning and extinction. Yet, the precise interactions within this network and their relationship to individual learning abilities and extinction have remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how functional (FC), effective (EC), and structural (SC) connectivity patterns in the core learning network allow predicting individual differences in the efficacy of learning, extinction, and renewal. Analysing a large dataset of over 500 participants across a multitude of paradigms, our results revealed that FC predicted better acquisition, with a central role of ACC and hippocampus, whereas SC, involving ACC and amygdala, predicted higher levels of extinction learning. EC results suggested a predominantly inhibitory coupling among core learning network nodes, with paradigm-specific EC connectivity patterns predicting learning. Our predictions not only generalised between fear and cognitive predictive learning paradigms but were also successful in predicting learning from task-related FC and simulated data. Together, these results describe the multimodal neural determinants of learning, extinction, and renewal, and may inform individualised interventions for affective disorders based on neural connectivity patterns.

">Capturing individual variation in children's oscillatory brain activity during nREM sleep</a></h4>

              
                Human brain dynamics are highly unique between individuals: functional neuroimaging studies have recently described functional features that can be used as neural fingerprints. As such studies have generally been performed on adults, it is unclear if the results are applicable during brain development. Here we applied Bayesian reduced-rank regression (BRRR), to extract low-dimensional representations of electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra measured from normally developing children at different ages. The clinical EEG recordings represented different sleep stages in a pediatric population (N=782) of ages varying from 6 weeks to 19 years. The representations learned within specific sleep stages successfully separated between the subjects. Furthermore, a model trained with data across sleep stages generalized to unseen data, suggesting that informative neural fingerprints could be extracted. Fingerprint stability increased with the age of the subjects. In comparison to correlation-based measures in differentiating individuals from each other, the BRRR model performed better, highlighting the usefulness of the dimensionality reduction for data obtained in demanding clinical settings. While further studies are needed to address the possible non-linear maturation effects over developmental periods, our results demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of stable within-session neurofunctional fingerprints in pediatric populations.

">Function of the auditory cortex characterized by its intrinsic dynamic coactivation patterns estimated in individuals</a></h4>

              
                Determining the functional organization of the auditory cortex (AC) has been difficult with conventional task-based approaches due to the broad responsiveness of auditory subregions to various acoustic properties. Moreover, most studies have investigated functional organization of AC with static methods, although brain has shown to be organized into dynamic networks. Here, we investigated dynamically varying coactivation patterns of the local networks in the auditory cortex (AC) determined from 7T fMRI data with a novel individualized network-based algorithm. An eight-pattern solution was selected for closer examination based on its high reproducibility of the occurrence rates (r=0.86) and the spatial topography (r=0.79) between sessions. Dynamic AC patterns successfully captured interindividual variability, as indicated by significantly higher variability between than within individuals for the AC pattern occurrence rates and spatial topographies. The coactivation patterns shared similarities between resting-state and auditory-task data, as indicated by the group-level similarity of 0.84 and individual-level similarity of 0.71 in the spatial topographies. Furthermore, the occurrence rates of AC patterns identified in the task data, using pattern templates derived from resting-state data, correlated with specific task contrast regressors. Our results indicate that the AC function can be characterized by a set of dynamically varying coactivation patterns that are consistently observed during resting state and auditory stimulation, and that get synchronized with auditory input. These findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity in the AC and support the development of more time-efficient paradigms for studying its functional organization.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Infants’ electroencephalography (EEG) dominant rhythm oscillates between 6 and 9 Hz. The desynchronization of this rhythm from baseline to the processing of visual stimuli is used as an index to better understand the development of visual attention. However, development trajectories of desynchronization remain underexplored. Additionally, it is unclear whether development of desynchronization is sensitive to task demands or if it reflects broader developmental changes. To investigate these questions, EEG data were collected from infants aged 6, 9, and 12 months while they passively viewed a fixation cross followed by 10-s trials of a female face or novel object tracked down the screen. Dominant rhythm desynchronization was calculated by subtracting power during the fixation period from power during each task condition. The results revealed significant desynchronization in response to faces at occipital electrodes for all age groups. The magnitude of the desynchronization also increased from 6 to 9 to 12 months of age in response to faces over right occipital electrodes. No significant desynchronization was observed for object stimuli. These findings suggest that dominant rhythm desynchronization develops across infancy and is sensitive to stimulus type. The increased desynchronization for faces compared to objects highlights infants’ general preference for faces relative to objects.</span>

Brain network connectivity, particularly as measured by the participation coefficient (PC), offers a valuable framework for elucidating these neural changes. This study investigated the effects of WMT on brain network connectivity, utilizing PC as a primary assessment of network integration and segregation. The relationship between WMT-induced changes in PC and the density of specific neurotransmitter receptors was examined. Seventy-six healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a WMT group or a control group. After 8 wks of training, the WMT group exhibited significant cognitive improvements, especially in near and far transfer tasks. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by specific changes in brain connectivity, including a reduction in PC within the sensorimotor network and node-specific alterations in the left prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital-parietal junction, and parietal operculum. Moreover, changes in PC were significantly correlated with the density of dopamine D2 receptors, mu-opioid receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. These findings enhance our understanding of how WMT influences cognitive function and brain network connectivity, highlighting the potential for targeting specific networks and neurotransmitter systems in cognitive training interventions.</span>

                <p>Despite its central role in the proper functioning of the motor system, sensation has been less studied than motor outputs in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring sensation non-invasively: while motor outputs have easily observable consequences, sensation is inherently an internal variable of the motor system. In this study, we investigated how well participants can sense relevant sensory stimuli that induce locomotor adaptation. We addressed this question with a split-belt treadmill, which moves the legs at different speeds. We used a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm with multiple repetitions of various speed differences considering the probabilistic nature of perceptual responses. We found that the participants correctly identified a speed difference of 49.7 mm/s in 75% of the trials when walking at 1.05 m/s (i.e., 4.7% Weber Fraction). To gain insight into the perceptual process in walking, we applied a drift-diffusion model (DDM) relating the participants&rsquo; identification of speed difference (i.e., stimulus identification) and their response time during walking. The implemented DDM was able to predict participants&rsquo; stimulus identification for all speed differences by simply using the recorded reaction times (RTs) to fit a single set of model parameters. Taken together, our results indicate that individuals can accurately identify smaller speed differences than previously reported and that participants&rsquo; stimulus perception follows the evidence accumulation process outlined by drift diffusion models, conventionally used for short-latency, static sensory tasks, rather than long-latency, and motor tasks such as walking.</p>

                <p>by Neda Shahidi, Fernando Rozenblit, Mohammad H. Khani, Helene M. Schreyer, Matthias Mietsch, Dario A. Protti, Tim Gollisch</p>

The dichotomy of excitation and suppression is one of the canonical mechanisms explaining the complexity of neural activity. Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neuron’s spiking responses and shapes the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models for predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depends on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and perform best for different temporal regimes of these interactions.

                <p>by Di Wu, Qi Ouyang, Hongli Wang, Youdong Mao</p>

Despite high-resolution structural studies on the USP14-proteasome-substrate complexes, time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results on USP14-regulated allostery of the 26S proteasome are still very limited and a quantitative understanding of substrate degradation dynamics remains elusive. In this study, we propose a mean field model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for USP14 regulated substrate degradation in 26S proteasome. The kinetic model incorporates recent cryo-EM findings on the allostery of 26S proteasome and generates results in good agreement with time-resolved experimental observations. The model elucidates that USP14 typically reduces the substrate degradation rate and reveals the functional dependence of this rate on the concentrations of substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the substrate for different ATP concentrations is predicted. When multiple substrates are present, the model suggests that substrates that are easier to insert into the OB-ring and disengage from the proteasome, or less likely to undergo deubiquitination would be more favored to be degraded by the USP14-bound proteasome. The mean field model proposed here quantitatively considers the process of proteasomal substrate degradation from the perspective of chemical kinetics, and provides a quantitative framework to decode the dynamic interplay between USP14 and the proteasome.

                <p>by Romani Osbourne, Kelly M. Thayer</p>

The link between p53 tumor suppressive functions and organismal lifespan is multifaceted. Its DNA-repair mechanism is longevity-enhancing while its role in cellular senescence pathways induces pro-aging phenotypes. To understand how p53 may regulate organismal lifespan, cross-species genotype-phenotype (GP) studies of the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) have been used to assess the correlation of amino acid changes to lifespan. Amino acid changes in non-DNA-binding regions such as the transactivation (TAD), proline-rich (PRD), regulatory (REG), and tetramerization (TET) are largely unexplored. In addition, existing GP correlation tools such as SigniSite do not account for phylogenetic relationships between aligned sequences in correlating genotypic differences to phenotypes such as lifespan. To identify phylogenetically significant, longevity-correlated residues in full-length p53 alignments, we developed a Python- and R-based workflow, Relative Evolutionary Scoring (RES). While RES-predicted longevity-associated residues (RPLARs) are concentrated primarily in the DBD, the PRD, TET, and REG domains also house RPLARs. While yeast functional assay enrichment reveals that RPLARs may be dispensable for p53-mediated transactivation, PEPPI and Rosetta-based protein-protein interaction prediction suggests a role for RPLARs in p53 stability and interaction interfaces of tumor suppressive protein-protein complexes. With experimental validation of the RPLARs’ roles in p53 stability, transactivity, and involvement in senescence-regulatory pathways, we can gain crucial insights into mechanisms underlying dysregulated tumor suppression and accelerated aging.

                <p>by Anastasia Galperina, Gabriele Andrea Lugli, Christian Milani, Willem M. De Vos, Marco Ventura, Anne Salonen, Bonnie Hurwitz, Alise Jany Ponsero</p>

The growing interest in the role of the gut virome in human health and disease, has led to several recent large-scale viral catalogue projects mining human gut metagenomes each using varied computational tools and quality control criteria. Importantly, there has been to date no consistent comparison of these catalogues’ quality, diversity, and overlap. In this project, we therefore systematically surveyed nine previously published human gut viral catalogues. While these catalogues collectively screened >40,000 human fecal metagenomes, 82% of the recovered 345,613 viral sequences were unique to one catalogue, highlighting limited redundancy between the ressources and suggesting the need for an aggregated resource bringing these viral sequences together. We further expanded these viral catalogues by mining 7,867 infant gut metagenomes from 12 large-scale infant studies collected in 9 different countries. From these datasets, we constructed the Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC), a unified modular resource containing 1,018,941 dereplicated viral sequences (449,859 species-level vOTUs). Using computational inference tools, annotations were obtained for each vOTU representative sequence quality, viral taxonomy, predicted viral lifestyle, and putative host. This project aims to facilitate the reuse of previously published viral catalogues by the research community and follows a modular framework to enable future expansions as novel data becomes available.

Sensory thresholds enable animals to regulate their behavioral responses to environmental threats. Despite the importance of sensory thresholds for animal behavior and human health, we do not yet have a full appreciation of the underlying molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms. The larval zebrafish acoustic startle response provides a powerful system to identify molecular mechanisms underlying establishment of sensory thresholds and plasticity of thresholds through mechanisms like habituation. Using this system, we identify Cadherin-16 as a previously undescribed regulator of sensory gating. We demonstrate that Cadherin-16 regulates sensory thresholds via an endocrine organ, the corpuscle of Stannius (CS), which is essential in zebrafish for regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. We further show that Cadherin-16 regulates whole-body calcium and ultimately behavior through the hormone Stanniocalcin 1l (Stc1l), and the IGF-regulatory metalloprotease, Papp-aa. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the CS through ablation experiments that reveal its role in promoting normal acoustic sensory gating. Together, our results uncover a previously undescribed brain non-autonomous pathway for the regulation of behavior and underscore Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis as a critical process underlying sensory gating <i>in vivo.</i>

Agricultural diseases are a major threat to sustainable food production. Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus <i>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</i> (Bgt). We sampled Bgt across two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions. We identified a single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, <i>AvrPm17</i>, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple <i>AvrPm17</i> haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade <i>Pm17</i> resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>T</i>ubulin <i>P</i>olymerization <i>P</i>romoting <i>P</i>roteins (TPPPs) are highly conserved across species but remain poorly understood. There are three <i>TPPP</i> genes in humans, with only one homologous <i>TPPP</i> gene in invertebrates, such as <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. The human TPPP (TPPP1/p25/p25α) is enriched in the brain and shares sequence similarities with the invertebrate TPPPs. TPPP/p25 associates with microtubules and plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics, bundling, and polymerization, thereby stabilizing the microtubular network. This is essential for cytoskeletal organization and proper functioning of neurons and glial cells, including axonal growth, regeneration, migration, trafficking, synapse formation, and myelination of axons. However, studies have also uncovered that besides its cytoplasmic/microtubular localization, TPPP/p25 is present in other subcellular compartments, including the mitochondria and nucleus, underscoring the presence of additional novel functions. At the molecular level, TPPP/p25 is predicted to exist as an intrinsically disordered protein and is implicated in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's and related disorders and Multiple Sclerosis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of TPPP/p25, highlighting its evolutionary conservation, cellular and subcellular localization, established and emerging functions in the nervous system, interacting partners, potential clinical relevance to human neurological disorders, and conclude with unresolved questions and future areas of study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1089/v3?src=rss">Predicting gene expression changes upon epigenomic drug treatment [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tumors are characterized by global changes in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are functionally linked to tumor progression. Accordingly, several drugs targeting the epigenome have been proposed for cancer therapy, notably, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as vorinostat and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as zebularine. However, a fundamental challenge with such approaches is the lack of genomic specificity, i.e., the transcriptional changes at different genomic loci can be highly variable, thus making it difficult to predict the consequences on the global transcriptome and drug response. For instance, treatment with DNMTi may upregulate the expression of not only a tumor suppressor but also an oncogene, leading to unintended adverse effect. Methods Given the pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenomic profile of a sample, we assessed the extent of predictability of locus-specific changes in gene expression upon treatment with HDACi using machine learning. Results We found that in two cell lines (HCT116 treated with Largazole at eight doses and RH4 treated with Entinostat at 1µM) where the appropriate data (pre-treatment transcriptome and epigenome as well as post-treatment transcriptome) is available, our model distinguished the post-treatment up versus downregulated genes with high accuracy (up to ROC of 0.89). Furthermore, a model trained on one cell line is applicable to another cell line suggesting generalizability of the model. Conclusions Here we present a first assessment of the predictability of genome-wide transcriptomic changes upon treatment with HDACi. Lack of appropriate omics data from clinical trials of epigenetic drugs currently hampers the assessment of applicability of our approach in clinical setting.

                Introduction Hospital staff’s perception of oral health directly impacts their overall oral health-related well-being (OHRQoL) and their job performance. This study seeks to analyze the relationship between these two dimensions, providing information for designing strategies that promote a healthier work environment. Aim To determine the relationship between oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and oral health perceptions in the staff of a level II-1 hospital located in northern Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, with a cross-sectional, applied, and correlational design. Seventy-two participants participated. The validated OHIP-14 and HU-DBI questionnaires were used, with reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, appropriate for ordinal variables, was used for data analysis. Results A statistically significant association was found between health-related quality of life and subjective perception of oral status (Rho = 0.391, p < 0.05), with an explained variance of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R-squared. The most frequently associated quality of life dimensions were physical disability (Rho = 0.319; p < 0.05) and social disability (Rho = 0.242; p < 0.05). Excellent quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while poor oral health was the most common (52.8%). Conclusion The findings show a significant relationship between self-perceived oral health and oral health-related quality of life in this group of professionals. Promoting oral health strategies tailored to the hospital setting is recommended to improve workplace well-being.

                Anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysms represent 23-40% of cerebral aneurysms and 12-15% of unruptured aneurysms, with a higher risk of rupture compared to other cerebral aneurysms. This case report presents a 56-year-old female admitted to a private hospital with acute headache and nausea, subsequently diagnosed with an ACOM aneurysm. The patient had no significant medical history, belonged to an intergenerational family, and maintained good mental health. Physical examination revealed a woman of thin frame (152 cm, 51 kg) with normal vital signs. Laboratory findings indicated low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dl), elevated sodium (19.1 mcg/dl), high creatinine (5.4 mcg), and elevated calcium (11.5 mcg/dl). Treatment included ondansetron, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium citrate, and alpha-blockers. The case highlights the importance of prompt intervention for ACOM aneurysms regardless of size, along with the necessity of comprehensive postoperative monitoring to detect complications such as bleeding and neurological impairments. Postoperative imaging is crucial to assess clipping effectiveness and monitor for potential complications.

                Background of the study This research examines how psychological and social biases affect individual investors’ investing decisions. Investor sentiment significantly influences financial markets, frequently causing stock prices to deviate from their intrinsic values. In rising economies such as India, where retail investors are significantly affected by psychological factors, comprehending these attitudes is crucial. Methods This study analyses data from a comprehensive questionnaire that was conducted throughout the nation and included 552 retail investors. The investigation employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the elements that influence the decision-making of individuals who invest in the Indian stock market. Findings The research offers insight on the influence that investor attitude has on investment decision-making as well as the factors that precede it. The study demonstrates that investors make financial decisions based on sentiment. In addition to assessing the efficacy of the Indian financial market, this study sought to ascertain the rationality of investors’ choices by exploring the factors that influence their decision-making process. Conclusion The outcome of the study shows that information seeking, anchoring, herding, representativeness, and overconfidence all have a big impact on investors. Moreover, the study has proven investors’ irrationality and stock market inefficiency. The findings may be employed to further examine the trading practices of international investors and encourage further study in the field of behavioural finance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-473/v1?src=rss">Overcoming Data Barriers: Digital Inclusion and Equitable Public Services for People with Disabilities in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Ensuring equitable access to public services for people with disabilities remains a persistent challenge in digital governance. Despite advancements in data governance frameworks, disparities in accessibility continue to exclude marginalized populations. While government-led digital initiatives f ocus on efficiency and compliance, their impact on vulnerable groups remains underexplored. This study examines the causal factors influencing audit data governance in Thailand’s public sector, with a particular focus on the contrasting perspectives between government officials, who are responsible for delivering public services, and people with disabilities, who rely on these services. Methods This research employs Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MG-SEM) to analyze survey responses from 711 participants, including policymakers, policy implementers, auditors, and people with disabilities (specifically individuals with visual and physical impairments). The study utilizes a quantitative approach, ensuring that all analyses are based on structured survey data. Key constructs examined include public service delivery for people with disabilities (measured by perception of public service, enablers for access to data, citizen-oriented policy, and fair & efficient administrative procedures), data-driven culture, which ultimately influence audit data governance. Results The findings reveal significant disparities in how data governance is perceived. Government officials emphasize efficiency, compliance, and regulatory adherence, whereas people with disabilities prioritize accessibility, usability, and inclusivity in digital public services. These contrasting perspectives highlight systemic barriers that hinder the equitable implementation of digital governance frameworks, exacerbating the digital divide in public service accessibility. Conclusions To address these challenges, the study proposes targeted policy interventions, including the integration of AI-driven auditing mechanisms, the establishment of universal digital accessibility standards, and the implementation of participatory governance strategies. These recommendations provide valuable insights for policymakers, auditors, and public administrators aiming to foster transparency, trust, and inclusivity in digital public services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1299/v2?src=rss">A causality investigation into stock prices and macroeconomic indicators in the Indian stock market [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study The systematic impact of macroeconomic variables on stock market returns makes it crucial to comprehend the link between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Stock prices are closely linked to macroeconomic indicators, a crucial aspect for investors, policymakers, and researchers in emerging markets like India, influencing investment decisions and policy formulation. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used in this study to examine the causal links between specific macroeconomic factors and Indian stock prices from April 2009 to March 2023. Results The outcomes of the research suggest that macroeconomic variables exert influence on the Indian stock market, across the short and long term. Moreover, the results of the paired Granger causality test suggest that the domestic macroeconomic variables possess predictive significance for stock prices in the Indian stock market. Conclusion The study reveals that macroeconomic variables significantly impact the Indian stock market, highlighting the need for investors and portfolio managers to monitor these conditions to optimize returns and mitigate risks. The Reserve Bank of India should maintain an optimal money supply to prevent inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, while bolstering the export sector and facilitating imports through initiatives like Atma-nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India. Policies focusing on productivity, infrastructure, and a favourable business environment are also crucial. Therefore, it is crucial for investors and portfolio managers to consistently analyse the current macroeconomic conditions in order to maximize their profits and minimize risks. This research has extensive significance for comprehending the intricate connections between the stock market and macroeconomic issues.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.70041?af=R">A Novel H2S Donor Alleviates Neuroinflammation and Seizures by Inhibiting the C3‐C3aR Pathway</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Both astrocytes and microglia are activated in the epileptic brain. There is an interaction between them through the complement 3 (C3)-C3a receptor (C3aR) pathway, which plays a detrimental role in seizures. Our self-developed novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor has been found to have anti-seizure effects. However, its mechanism remains to be explored. In the present study, we showed that the novel H<sub>2</sub>S donor can inhibit the activation of astrocytes and microglia and their interaction through C3-C3aR signaling, which contributed to alleviating microglial neuroinflammation and seizures. In LPS-treated astrocytes and pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor reduced C3 production in astrocytes and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-10 in microglia. The H<sub>2</sub>S donor also reduced the EEG amplitude of hippocampal epileptic waves and relieved seizures in epileptic mice. These effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor can be reversed by intranasal C3 treatment and mimicked by a C3aR antagonist. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the anti-seizure effects of the H<sub>2</sub>S donor. Therefore, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor has the potential to be used as a candidate for antiepileptic drugs.</p>
