                Background The present study is an endeavor to explore the global focus on maternal malnutrition research across the globe. The study underscores the development of maternal malnutrition research across the globe and may give impetus to researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for further research in this domain. Methods The study is descriptive in nature and used a mixed method approach that includes bibliometrics and altmetrics techniques to explore maternal malnutrition research. The study initiated with systematic data extraction from SCOPUS Database with proper data extraction criteria. The bibliometrics techniques include quantitative and qualitative techniques. The initial part of the study explores the quantitative dimension, including authorship studies, growth rate of publications, country-wise productivity and citation impact across the studied period. The second part of the study is dedicated to trend analysis that reveals the focused areas in malnutrition research. The third part of this study delves into the social impact of the concerned set of literature by analyzing the social media attention score through Altmetrics. Results It is found that there is a relatively low rate of growth of publications, with publications published in 2016 being more impactful and a preference for multi-authored publications over single-authored publications. Regional distribution highlights disparities in the research focus. Thematic analysis identified key clusters, such as acute malnutrition and maternal-child health interdependencies, with emerging areas in public health nutrition and epigenetics. Altmetric analysis has shown an active but declining trend in discourse on academic and social media platforms. Conclusions Results underscore the need for holistic interventions addressing both nutritional and psychosocial factors during pregnancy to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health and promote better outcomes for mothers and their children.

                Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder frequently associated with male sexual and reproductive dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction (ED), reduced libido, and impaired spermatogenesis. Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) fruit extract has been reported to possess antidiabetic and reproductive benefits, yet its effect on DM-related ED remains underexplored. Objective To evaluate the effects of Piper nigrum fruit extract on erectile function, libido, sperm parameters, and testicular histology in alloxan-induced diabetic male rats. Methods Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic rats treated with black pepper extract (122.5 or 245 mg/kg BW), and diabetic rats treated with sildenafil citrate. Erectile function was assessed via penile reflexes, libido by mating behavior, sperm quality by concentration, motility, and morphology, and testicular histology by Leydig cell and spermatogonia counts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with significance at p<0.05. Results Alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed significant impairment in erectile function, libido, sperm quality, and testicular histology (p<0.001 vs control). Black pepper extract at 122.5 mg/kg BW significantly improved total penile reflexes compared with diabetic controls (9.33±1.03 vs 6.00±1.26, p=0.02). Libido parameters including courtship latency (5.50±0.55 vs 21.00±9.47, p=0.013), mount latency (19.00±10.81 vs 37.17±6.31, p=0.009), and mount frequency (18.05±5.99 vs 7.17±1.83, p=0.002) were significantly improved. Sperm analysis revealed increases in sperm concentration (19.2±6.7 vs 12.6±1.3, though not significant, p=0.877), motility (31.8±23 vs 27±30, p=0.697), and normal morphology (40.9±7.8 vs 35±10.8, p=0.04). Testicular histology showed restoration of Leydig cell count (59.33±4.0 vs 30.50±3.86, p=0.035) and spermatogonia number (319.4±64.59 vs 491±37.0, p<0.001). The 245 mg/kg BW dose primarily improved sperm concentration (62.95±29.4 vs 12.6±1.3, p=0.01) and motility (36.6±23 vs 27±30, p=0.436). Sildenafil citrate significantly enhanced most parameters compared with diabetic controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Piper nigrum fruit extract ameliorates sexual dysfunction and reproductive impairment in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, particularly at 122.5 mg/kg BW, with significant improvements in erectile function, libido (p<0.05), sperm quality (p≤0.04), and testicular histology (p=0.035). These findings suggest its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for DM-related male reproductive dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-37/v1?src=rss">Assessing data management and compliance in large research collaborations via knowledge bases:  A semi-structured interview approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Large-scale research collaborations rely not only on robust research strategies but also on structured data management and systematic knowledge exchange. Ensuring compliance with ethical and legal requirements is essential from the beginning. This includes obtaining informed consent and adhering to data protection laws such as the GDPR (for Europe), as well as following Open Science and FAIR principles, particularly when working with personal data. Additionally, the systematic assessment and documentation of project objectives, data characteristics, and other project-specific features are essential for advancing the scientific contribution and long-term development of such collaborations. Methods In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed to identify commonalities across research projects and to enhance data governance within large research consortia. The approach consists of three components: (1) a semi-structured interview that served a dual purpose: first, to raise awareness among researchers regarding ethical obligations, data protection requirements, and open science principles; second, to systematically collect metadata on planned studies, data types, participant groups, and methodological procedures; (2) structured processing and organization of the collected information; and (3) visualization of project interrelations through knowledge graphs. The methodology was piloted within a collaborative research centre in linguistics. Results The collected metadata were systematically structured and used to construct knowledge graphs capturing interrelations among projects, data types, methodologies, and participant groups. These visualizations enable research consortia to make informed decisions about collaboration, infrastructure planning, and data reuse. Conclusions The proposed methodology offers a systematic way to assess data management practices, while also fostering a culture of compliance and transparency from the ground up. Knowledge graph visualizations provide a practical tool for identifying synergies, promoting data reuse, and strengthening transparency across projects. This approach can serve as a foundation for developing sustainable research infrastructures in consortia working with diverse empirical data.

                Background Breast metastasis from lung cancer is an extremely rare clinical event, particularly in men, and therefore remains poorly documented. Case presentation We report the case of a 45-year-old man with primary lung adenocarcinoma who subsequently developed a breast metastasis. He initially presented with spinal pain. Physical examination revealed cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the most accessible axillary lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. Chemotherapy was initiated. Ten months later, the patient developed a painless ipsilateral breast mass. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of breast metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion Distinguishing between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma is essential because their treatment and prognosis differ considerably. Accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial for optimal patient management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-35/v1?src=rss">Understanding the Link Between Toxic Leadership and Employee Well-being: The Interplay of Employee Turnover, Organizational commitment, Shift timing & Industry Sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the impact of toxic leadership on employee well-being and turnover across various industry sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Toxic leadership, marked by manipulative and hostile behaviors, has been associated with negative employee outcomes. However, limited research has jointly explored these effects with the moderating roles of organizational commitment and shift timing in this regional context. Grounded in Social Exchange Theory, Psychological Contract Theory, and Conservation of Resources Theory, the study investigates how toxic leadership influences employee well-being and turnover and whether organizational commitment, shift timing, and industry sector moderate these relationships. Methods A quantitative survey design was used, involving responses from 300 employees representing diverse sectors. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied to assess the direct and moderating effects of toxic leadership on well-being and turnover. The analysis examined model significance, variance explained, and moderation through interaction terms while confirming validity and reliability through AVE, HTMT, and VIF metrics. Results Toxic leadership significantly reduced employee well-being (R = 0.445, R2 = 0.198) and increased turnover (R = 0.422, R2 = 0.178). Organizational commitment moderated the toxic leadership–turnover relationship (B = 0.2124, p = .0088) but did not moderate the toxic leadership–well-being relationship. Shift timing and industry sector showed minimal moderation with negligible variance explained. The structural model demonstrated good fit and explanatory power for turnover (R2 = 0.582) and workplace behavior (R2 = 0.373), confirming acceptable reliability and validity indices. Conclusion Toxic leadership detrimentally affects employee well-being and retention across all sectors. Organizational commitment partially buffers these effects on turnover but not on well-being. Findings highlight that reducing toxic leadership behaviors is essential for employee health and organizational stability, as contextual factors like shift timing or sector offer limited protective influence.

                Background The Blue Economy has emerged as the dominant paradigm for ocean governance, promising to reconcile maritime economic expansion with environmental protection through technological innovation and market instruments. However, it rests on theoretically precarious commitments: absolute decoupling of growth from environmental degradation, techno-managerial universalism, and marketisation of marine commons. This article develops a theoretical critique of the Blue Economy by synthesizing degrowth scholarship and political ecology to expose how growth-compatible ocean governance reproduces dispossession, intensification, and unequal exchange in Global South contexts. Methods This literature-based study employs purposive sampling and thematic synthesis to build a conceptual critique. The analysis centers degrowth as the primary theoretical lens and deploys political ecology concepts—enclosure, spatial fix, and ecologically unequal exchange—to trace causal mechanisms through which Blue Economy policies produce unjust distributive outcomes. Literature selection prioritized canonical degrowth texts, foundational political ecology works, and critical Blue Economy scholarship. An illustrative composite vignette from Indonesian coastal contexts grounds the theoretical arguments. Results The synthesis yields six interrelated critiques demonstrating that the Blue Economy’s epistemic framing privileges market valuation over plural values; decoupling assumptions are empirically fragile and undermined by rebound effects and problem-shifting; market instruments commodify commons and enable governance capture; Blue Economy projects function as spatial fixes reproducing accumulation by dispossession; distributional outcomes are regressive; and techno-optimism masks problem-shifting. The article develops Blue Degrowth as a normative alternative, articulating five principles—limits and sufficiency, anti-colonial delinking, commons governance, local value retention, and democratic deliberation—and translates these into policy modalities including legal recognition of customary marine tenure, cooperative processing, precautionary moratoria, and alternative metrics beyond GDP. Conclusions Blue Degrowth offers a framework for just ocean governance that fundamentally breaks from growth-centric paradigms. Future research should test causal mechanisms through comparative studies, develop participatory sufficiency metrics, and explore coalition-building strategies for implementation in diverse Global South settings.

                Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) generates large and heterogeneous datasets where global (tissue-wide) quality control (QC) metrics often over-aggressively remove biologically meaningful regions or miss localized artifacts. Recently, spatially-aware QC metrics have been introduced in SpotSweeper, but this is limited to the R programming language, which makes it challenging to use these metrics within the Python/scverse ecosystem. Here, we present SpotSweeper-py, a Python equivalent package of SpotSweeper that computes neighborhood-aware z-scores for standard QC metrics such as total counts, log total counts, number of detected genes, and percentage of mitochondrial counts. We demonstrate the performance and usability of SpotSweeper-py on two public datasets from the 10x Genomics Visium and VisiumHD platforms. This implementation of local spatially-aware QC metrics enables direct integration with Python/scverse ecosystem, reduces false positives from global quality control while preserving tissue-specific architecture. Plotting utilities are also included for quick visualizations of flagged outliers. By making robust local QC accessible in Python, SpotSweeper-py strengthens the reliability of pipelines for analyzing SRT data. The open-source software is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/spotsweeper).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04380">Past Psychedelic Use Predicts Divergent Thinking</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychedelics have shown potential in treating a range of mental health conditions, yet far less is known about their impact on creativity. This study examined three components of creativity-divergent thinking, cognitive reflection, and insight in a large sample (N = 5,905) from the Great British Intelligence Test. We compared performance between individuals with past psychedelic use and those without such use. Psychedelic users scored significantly higher on divergent thinking than both non-drug users and drug users who had not used psychedelics. However, they did not score higher on measures of cognitive reflection, number of insights, or insight accuracy. These findings suggest that naturalistic psychedelic use may be associated with enhanced divergent thinking, but not enhanced insight-related performance. Future research should aim to establish causality through prospective designs and controlled studies incorporating long-term follow-up, biological data, and personality structure assessment.

Abstract: Synchronized rhythmic oscillatory activity in the beta frequency band in the basal ganglia (BG) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent experiments and theoretical studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of T-type and L-type calcium currents in shaping the activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. However, the role of these currents in the generation of synchronized activity patterns in BG networks involving STN is still unknown. In this study, using an STN model incorporating T-type and L-type calcium currents, we examined how these currents shape the patterns of neural activity in the subthalamo-pallidal network, including network dynamics in response to periodic external inputs. The dynamics were studied in relation to the network connectivity parameters - modulated by dopamine (depleted in PD's BG) - and compared with the properties of the temporal patterning of synchronous neural activity previously observed in the experimental studies with Parkinsonian patients. Stronger T-type current enhanced post-inhibitory rebound bursting and expanded synchronized rhythmic activity, reducing the range of intermittent synchrony and increasing resistance to external entrainment. Stronger L-type current prolonged STN bursts, promoted intermittent synchrony over a wide range of input amplitudes, and sustained beta oscillations, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of PD. These results highlight the interplay between intrinsic cellular properties, synaptic parameters, and external inputs in shaping pathological synchronized rhythms in BG networks. Understanding these network mechanisms may advance the understanding of Parkinsonian rhythmogenesis and further assist in finding ways to modulate and suppress pathological rhythms.

                arXiv:2601.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

                arXiv:2601.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a "natural" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the "H\'an D\=an Xu\'e B\`u" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a "Cargo Cult" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.

                arXiv:2601.05021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.

Abstract: Animals flexibly change their behavior depending on context. It is reported that the hippocampus is one of the most prominent regions for contextual behaviors, and its sequential activity shows context dependency. However, how such context-dependent sequential activity is established through reorganization of neuronal activity (remapping) is unclear. To better understand the formation of hippocampal activity and its contribution to context-dependent flexible behavior, we present a novel biologically plausible reinforcement learning model. In this model, Context selector promotes the formation of context-dependent sequential activity and allows for flexible switching of behavior in multiple contexts. This model reproduces a variety of findings from neural activity, optogenetic inactivation, human fMRI, and clinical research. Furthermore, our model predicts that imbalances in the ratio between sensory and contextual representations in Context selector account for schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors.

                arXiv:2601.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.

                arXiv:2601.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recurrent neural networks (RNNs) used to model biological neural networks, noise is typically introduced during training to emulate biological variability and regularize learning. The expectation is that removing the noise at test time should preserve or improve performance. Contrary to this intuition, we find that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs) often perform best at a nonzero noise level, specifically, the same level used during training. This noise preference typically arises when noise is injected inside the neural activation function; networks trained with noise injected outside the activation function perform best with zero noise. Through analyses of simple function approximation, maze navigation, and single neuron regulator tasks, we show that the phenomenon stems from noise-induced shifts of fixed points (stationary distributions) in the underlying stochastic dynamics of the RNNs. These fixed point shifts are noise-level dependent and bias the network outputs when the noise is removed, degrading performance. Analytical and numerical results show that the bias arises when neural states operate near activation function nonlinearities, where noise is asymmetrically attenuated, and that performance optimization incentivizes operation near these nonlinearities. Thus, networks can overfit to the stochastic training environment itself rather than just to the input-output data. The phenomenon is distinct from stochastic resonance, wherein nonzero noise enhances signal processing. Our findings reveal that training noise can become an integral part of the computation learned by recurrent networks, with implications for understanding neural population dynamics and for the design of robust artificial RNNs.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.

                arXiv:2601.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing scientific instrumentation often requires exploring large, highly constrained design spaces using computationally expensive physics simulations. These simulators pose substantial challenges for integrating evolutionary computation (EC) into scientific design workflows. Evolutionary computation typically requires numerous design evaluations, making the integration of slow, low-throughput simulators particularly challenging, as they are optimized for accuracy and ease of use rather than throughput. We present ECLIPSE, an evolutionary computation framework built to interface directly with complex, domain-specific simulation tools while supporting flexible geometric and parametric representations of scientific hardware. ECLIPSE provides a modular architecture consisting of (1) Individuals, which encode hardware designs using domain-aware, physically constrained representations; (2) Evaluators, which prepare simulation inputs, invoke external simulators, and translate the simulator's outputs into fitness measures; and (3) Evolvers, which implement EC algorithms suitable for high-cost, limited-throughput environments. We demonstrate the utility of ECLIPSE across several active space-science applications, including evolved 3D antennas and spacecraft geometries optimized for drag reduction in very low Earth orbit. We further discuss the practical challenges encountered when coupling EC with scientific simulation workflows, including interoperability constraints, parallelization limits, and extreme evaluation costs, and outline ongoing efforts to combat these challenges. ECLIPSE enables interdisciplinary teams of physicists, engineers, and EC researchers to collaboratively explore unconventional designs for scientific hardware while leveraging existing domain-specific simulation software.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed visual data analysis, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becoming highly effective in learning meaningful feature representations directly from images. Unlike traditional manual feature engineering methods, CNNs automatically extract hierarchical visual patterns, enabling strong performance across diverse real-world contexts. This study investigates the effectiveness of CNN-based architectures across five heterogeneous datasets spanning agricultural and urban domains: mango variety classification, paddy variety identification, road surface condition assessment, auto-rickshaw detection, and footpath encroachment monitoring. These datasets introduce varying challenges, including differences in illumination, resolution, environmental complexity, and class imbalance, necessitating adaptable and robust learning models.
  We evaluate a lightweight, task-specific custom CNN alongside established deep architectures, including ResNet-18 and VGG-16, trained both from scratch and using transfer learning. Through systematic preprocessing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation, we analyze how architectural complexity, model depth, and pre-training influence convergence, generalization, and performance across datasets of differing scale and difficulty. The key contributions of this work are: (1) the development of an efficient custom CNN that achieves competitive performance across multiple application domains, and (2) a comprehensive comparative analysis highlighting when transfer learning and deep architectures provide substantial advantages, particularly in data-constrained environments. These findings offer practical insights for deploying deep learning models in resource-limited yet high-impact real-world visual classification tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04799">Neural-Symbolic Integration with Evolvable Policies</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a promising approach for combining the learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretable reasoning of symbolic systems. However, existing NeSy frameworks typically require either predefined symbolic policies or policies that are differentiable, limiting their applicability when domain expertise is unavailable or when policies are inherently non-differentiable. We propose a framework that addresses this limitation by enabling the concurrent learning of both non-differentiable symbolic policies and neural network weights through an evolutionary process. Our approach casts NeSy systems as organisms in a population that evolve through mutations (both symbolic rule additions and neural weight changes), with fitness-based selection guiding convergence toward hidden target policies. The framework extends the NEUROLOG architecture to make symbolic policies trainable, adapts Valiant's Evolvability framework to the NeSy context, and employs Machine Coaching semantics for mutable symbolic representations. Neural networks are trained through abductive reasoning from the symbolic component, eliminating differentiability requirements. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that NeSy systems starting with empty policies and random neural weights can successfully approximate hidden non-differentiable target policies, achieving median correct performance approaching 100%. This work represents a step toward enabling NeSy research in domains where the acquisition of symbolic knowledge from experts is challenging or infeasible.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00380">Evolutionary Generative Optimization: Towards Fully Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization via Generative Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.00380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have demonstrated the potential of leveraging historical data to improve optimization accuracy and adaptability. Despite these advancements, existing methods remain reliant on handcrafted process-level operators. In contrast, Evolutionary Generative Optimization (EvoGO) is a fully data-driven framework designed from the objective level, enabling autonomous learning of the entire search process. EvoGO streamlines the evolutionary optimization process into three stages: data preparation, model training, and population generation. The data preparation stage constructs a pairwise dataset to enrich training diversity without incurring additional evaluation costs. During model training, a tailored generative model learns to transform inferior solutions into superior ones. In the population generation stage, EvoGO replaces traditional reproduction operators with a scalable and parallelizable generative mechanism. Extensive experiments on numerical benchmarks, classical control problems, and high-dimensional robotic tasks demonstrate that EvoGO consistently converges within merely 10 generations and substantially outperforms a wide spectrum of optimization approaches, including traditional EAs, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning based methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogo

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00245">Modern Neuromorphic AI: From Intra-Token to Inter-Token Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.00245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.

                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is a major contributor to long-term neurological dysfunction, yet many preclinical models lack precise control and quantification of biomechanical forces across impacts. We developed a reproducible, closed-skull mouse model of rmTBI using a custom-built weight&ndash;drop apparatus featuring a solenoid-based rebound arrest system, integrated high-speed videography, and accelerometry to track head kinematics during impact. Adult male and female mice received either a single impact or nine daily impacts. Linear and angular acceleration data were analyzed alongside behavioral and histological outcomes. Our apparatus delivered consistent impact and velocity forces with minimal intersubject variability. Additionally, the animals experienced consistent linear and angular acceleration as measured using high-speed video capture. These impacts did not cause skull fracture or acute vascular hemorrhage, but impacted animals had increased return of righting reflex time, consistent with mild, concussion-like symptoms. Behavioral testing revealed reduced performance of rmTBI-affected mice in an olfaction-mediated foraging task (buried food task), particularly at later timepoints, consistent with progressive olfactory impairment. Immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1 and CD68 in the brain demonstrated sex-dependent microglial activation, with males showing higher expression levels in both single- and nine-impact models. Among the brain regions investigated, microglial activation was most pronounced in the corpus callosum, neocortex, and olfactory tubercle. These findings underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in rmTBI research and support the utility of this model for probing injury thresholds, regional vulnerability, and potential therapeutic interventions in repetitive head trauma.</p>

                <p>While the most common statistical tests assume that the error of the dependent variable follows a normal distribution, dependent variables in translational neuroscience studies often fail to meet this assumption. Common statistical tests like the <I>t</I> test and ANOVA are based on the normality assumption, but quite often these tests are used without checking whether the dependent variable meets the normality assumption which can lead to erroneous interpretations and conclusions about observed associations. There is a significant need for the neuroscience community to utilize nonparametric statistics, particularly for regression analyses. Neuroscientists can greatly enhance the rigor of their analyses by understanding and utilizing nonparametric regression techniques that provide robust estimates of associations when data are skewed. This commentary will discuss and demonstrate analytic techniques that can be used when data do not meet the assumption of normality.</p>

                Rural tourism remains underexplored compared to urban and luxury destinations, yet it offers significant potential for sustainable development. Travel influencers, through digital storytelling and endorsements, are increasingly shaping tourist perceptions and reducing uncertainties about homestays. This study examines the impact of influencer endorsements on homestay intentions, utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior as a guiding framework. Data from 216 urban tourists in Northern and Central India were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings reveal that rural image perception is the strongest predictor of homestay intentions, while subjective norms play a weaker but significant role. Influencer endorsements affect behaviour indirectly by enhancing destination image rather than exerting direct persuasion. The study advances the Theory of Planned Behavior by demonstrating the primacy of cognitive evaluations over normative pressures in the context of rural tourism. Practical implications underscore the need for destination marketers and homestay operators to utilize authentic storytelling and image-building strategies to effectively promote rural tourism.

                Abstract* Background Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) serves as a rescue therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), yet data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain limited. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several new ECMO centers were established to address rising demand. This study reports and analyzes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS who received ECMO support at a newly established high-volume ECMO center in Indonesia. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and severe ARDS who underwent ECMO between July 24, 2020, and August 26, 2021. Outcomes evaluated included mortality, ICU length of stay, ECMO duration, and complications. Statistical analyses were conducted using R Studio version 4.2.1. Results Among 26 patients who received ECMO (25 veno-venous [VV] and 1 veno-arterial [VA]), the in-hospital mortality rate was 65.4%, and the 90-day mortality rate reached 69.2%. Non-survivors were more likely to present with hypoalbuminemia (82.4%) and septic shock (58.8%) at ECMO initiation. Mortality was significantly associated with a longer interval from symptom onset to ECMO cannulation (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.01–1.84; p=0.04), occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during ECMO (OR 19.20; 95% CI 1.88–>100; p=0.01), and shorter duration from ECMO initiation to death or discharge (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69–0.99; p=0.04). No significant differences were found in pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation duration, ECMO support duration, or ICU length of stay between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions Survival in COVID-19–associated ARDS patients receiving ECMO is influenced by timing of intervention and the occurrence of complications such as MODS. Delayed initiation of ECMO after symptom onset and sepsis-related complications were associated with increased mortality. Optimizing early identification, infection control, and resource allocation, along with ongoing clinical training, are essential to improving outcomes in ECMO centers within resource-limited settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1271/v2?src=rss">Learning Science Beyond Sight: Conceptual Engagement of Elementary School Students with Visual Impairment through Hands-On Activities [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background A pressing challenge in science education is that visually impaired students continue to lack access to appropriate instructional media, making it difficult for them to engage with abstract concepts and resulting in limited opportunities for equitable education. Responding to this challenge, the present study investigates the design and implementation of hands-on, multisensory instructional strategies aimed at improving conceptual understanding of magnetism among elementary students with visual impairments. Method The research involved four elementary school students with varying degrees of visual acuity. Employing the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) framework, the research was divided into 3 stages: needs analysis (A) using explanatory case study, design and develop (DD) instructional media and validate using Aiken’s V, implement and evaluate (IE) the media into classroom activity using evaluative case study. Result The findings indicate that tactile models, auditory explanations, and adapted activity kits significantly improved students’ engagement and comprehension of key magnetism concepts such as magnetic properties, forces, and polarity. Through an evaluative case study, the research demonstrates that instructional materials tailored to the sensory and cognitive profiles of visually impaired learners not only foster deeper conceptual understanding but also promote greater participation and confidence in science learning. Conclusions Multisensory science kits help students access abstract science material so that it can be felt and helps achieve conceptual understanding. Moreover, the results may inform teachers, curriculum designers, and science education professionals on how to design and adapt science content in ways that are both accessible and pedagogically sound.

                Background Cement-based materials deteriorate significantly when exposed to high temperatures due to extensive microcracking, increased porosity, and dehydration of hydration products, all of which lower the materials’ mechanical performance and post-fire stability. This makes thermally robust mortar essential for protective applications in fire-prone areas as well as structural restoration. Method The goal of this study is to assess how the amount of polypropylene (PP) fiber in cement mortar affects its mechanical behavior, thermal resistance, and residual performance at temperatures as high as 600°C. Prior to and following exposure to increased temperatures of 200, 400, and 600°C, mortar mixes containing 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% PP fibers by volume were made and tested for workability, density, compressive strength, flexural strength, and flexural toughness. Results The results show that increasing PP fiber content decreases workability. PP fibers significantly improved high-temperature performance. At 600°C, the control mix retained only 19% of its compressive strength, while the 0.5% PP mix retained 33%. Flexural strength increased by 26–44% at ambient temperature for 0.5–1.0% PP fiber content, and at 600°C, PP mixes preserved up to 8% more flexural strength than the control. Toughness improved substantially, with the 1.5% PP mix showing nearly 10-time higher residual toughness than the control at 600°C. Conclusions In conclusion, the incorporation of 0.5-1.0% polypropylene fibers provides a balanced enhancement in thermal resistance, residual strength and ductility, confirming its effectiveness in producing mortar with superior structural integrity after exposed to high temperatures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-29/v1?src=rss">Protocol for Conducting a Scoping Review on The Impact of Non-academic Activities on Medical Students' Achievement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical education is intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing. Students must maintain academic excellence, acquire professional competence, and manage stress. Traditionally, academic success has been attributed to cognitive ability and classroom performance. However, growing evidence shows that extracurricular or non-academic activities such as research, leadership, athletics, volunteering, and peer teaching positively influence student learning and development. Participation in these activities fosters transferable skills such as time management, teamwork, communication, and resilience, which are vital for both academic success and clinical practice. Moreover, structured extracurricular involvement can protect against burnout, enhance motivation, and strengthen a sense of belonging, all of which are known to support learning outcomes. Despite increasing interest, existing studies remain fragmented and often focus on single activity types or well-being outcomes rather than direct academic achievement. This scoping review aims to map and synthesize the available evidence on how extracurricular participation relates to academic performance among medical students. Findings will clarify the educational value of such activities, identify gaps in the literature, and guide institutional policy and support strategies.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Objectives To evaluate the effect of diode laser therapy on bleeding control and soft tissue healing after tooth extraction in patients with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods Six patients with type 2 diabetes requiring dental extractions were included. Medical histories were reviewed, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels confirmed glycemic control, and panoramic radiographs ruled out periapical pathology. Extractions were performed under local anesthesia. Postoperatively, LLLT was applied using an 808-nm diode laser at 0.3 J energy output for 60 seconds to occlusal, vestibular, and lingual/palatal surfaces. A placebo laser application was performed in control sites. Results Diode laser therapy resulted in a reduction in both the amount and duration of postoperative bleeding, attributed to enhanced clot stability. Improved soft tissue healing was observed in laser-treated sites compared with placebo-treated sites. Conclusions LLLT using an 808-nm diode laser appears to promote hemostasis and accelerate soft tissue healing following dental extraction in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest a potential role for diode laser therapy as an adjunctive treatment in managing diabetic patients undergoing dental surgery.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                To date, glial cells in the enteric nervous system have been categorized by spatial location and morphology. Here, Muppirala et al. define distinct subtypes of enteric glia that align with this spatial classification and identify tachykinin signaling as a key mediator of glial diversification and subtype-specific function in intestinal motility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105418">Cross-species evaluation of TANGO2 homologs, including HRG-9 and HRG-10 in Caenorhabditis elegans, challenges a proposed role in heme trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the <i>TANGO2</i> gene are associated with a severe neurometabolic disorder in humans, often presenting with life-threatening metabolic crisis. However, the function of TANGO2 protein remains unknown. It has recently been proposed that TANGO2 transports heme within and between cells, from areas with high heme concentrations to those with lower concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that prior heme-related observations in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> lacking TANGO2 homologs HRG-9 and HRG-10 may be better explained by a previously unreported metabolic phenotype, characterized by reduced feeding, decreased lifespan and brood sizes, and poor motility. We also show that several genes not implicated in heme transport are upregulated in the low heme state and conversely demonstrate that <i>hrg-9</i> in particular is highly responsive to oxidative stress, independent of heme status. Collectively, these data implicate bioenergetic failure and oxidative stress as potential factors in the pathophysiology of TANGO2 deficiency, in alignment with observations from human patients. Our group performed several experiments in yeast and zebrafish deficient in TANGO2 homologs and was unable to replicate prior findings from these models. Overall, we believe there is insufficient evidence to support heme transport as the primary function for TANGO2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107650">Dissecting surveying behavior of reactive microglia under chronic neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration – transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia–neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104921">Phase-specific premotor inhibition modulates leech rhythmic motor output</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how motoneuron activity is finely tuned remains an open question. Leeches are a highly suitable organism for studying motor control due to their well-characterized behaviors and relatively simple nervous system. On solid surfaces, leeches display crawling, a rhythmic motor pattern that can be elicited in the isolated nerve cord or even in single ganglia isolated from it. This study aimed to learn how this motor output is shaped by concurrent premotor signals. Specifically, we analyzed how electrophysiological manipulation of a premotor nonspiking (NS) neuron, which forms a recurrent inhibitory circuit (analogous to that formed by vertebrate Renshaw cells), shapes the leech crawling motor pattern. The study included a quantitative analysis of putative motor units active throughout the fictive crawling cycle that shows that the rhythmic motor output in isolated ganglia mirrors the phase relationships observed in vivo. Taken together, the study reveals that the premotor NS neurons, under the control of the segmental pattern generator, modulated the degree of excitation of motoneurons during crawling in a phase-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105287">Pupil dilation offers a time-window on prediction error</a></h4>

              
                Task-evoked pupil dilation is notably linked to unexpected events. Building on Zénon’s (2019) information-theory framework, we investigated whether the pupil’s response to feedback on decision outcomes during associative learning reflects a prediction error signal. Operationally, we defined prediction errors as an interaction between stimulus-pair frequency and accuracy. We then tested if these signals correlated with information gain, formally defined as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between posterior and prior belief distributions of an ideal observer. We reasoned that information gain should be proportional to the precision-weighted prediction error signals potentially arising from neuromodulatory arousal networks. We analyzed two data sets in which participants performed perceptual decision-making tasks while pupil dilation was recorded. Our findings consistently showed that a significant proportion of variability in the post-feedback pupil response was explained by information gain shortly after feedback presentation. For the first time, we present evidence that whether the pupil dilates or constricts along with information gain was context dependent. This study offers empirical evidence that the pupil’s response provides valuable insights into the process of model updating during learning, highlighting its utility as a physiological indicator of internal belief states.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103512">Barcode activity in a recurrent network model of the hippocampus enables efficient memory binding</a></h4>

              
                Forming an episodic memory requires binding together disparate elements that co-occur in a single experience. One model of this process is that neurons representing different components of a memory bind to an ‘index’ — a subset of neurons unique to that memory. Evidence for this model has recently been found in chickadees, which use hippocampal memory to store and recall locations of cached food. Chickadee hippocampus produces sparse, high-dimensional patterns (‘barcodes’) that uniquely specify each caching event. Unexpectedly, the same neurons that participate in barcodes also exhibit conventional place tuning. It is unknown how barcode activity is generated, and what role it plays in memory formation and retrieval. It is also unclear how a memory index (e.g. barcodes) could function in the same neural population that represents memory content (e.g. place). Here, we design a biologically plausible model that generates barcodes and uses them to bind experiential content. Our model generates barcodes from place inputs through the chaotic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and uses Hebbian plasticity to store barcodes as attractor states. The model matches experimental observations that memory indices (barcodes) and content signals (place tuning) are randomly intermixed in the activity of single neurons. We demonstrate that barcodes reduce memory interference between correlated experiences. We also show that place tuning plays a complementary role to barcodes, enabling flexible, contextually appropriate memory retrieval. Finally, our model is compatible with previous models of the hippocampus as generating a predictive map. Distinct predictive and indexing functions of the network are achieved via an adjustment of global recurrent gain. Our results suggest how the hippocampus may use barcodes to resolve fundamental tensions between memory specificity (pattern separation) and flexible recall (pattern completion) in general memory systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98047">Reconstructing voice identity from noninvasive auditory cortex recordings</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral processing of voice information is known to engage, in human as well as non-human primates, ‘temporal voice areas’ (TVAs) that respond preferentially to conspecific vocalizations. However, how voice information is represented by neuronal populations in these areas, particularly speaker identity information, remains poorly understood. Here, we used a deep neural network (DNN) to generate a high-level, small-dimension representational space for voice identity—the ‘voice latent space’ (VLS)—and examined its linear relation with cerebral activity via encoding, representational similarity, and decoding analyses. We find that the VLS maps onto fMRI measures of cerebral activity in response to tens of thousands of voice stimuli from hundreds of different speaker identities and better accounts for the representational geometry for speaker identity in the TVAs than in A1. Moreover, the VLS allowed TVA-based reconstructions of voice stimuli that preserved essential aspects of speaker identity as assessed by both machine classifiers and human listeners. These results indicate that the DNN-derived VLS provides high-level representations of voice identity information in the TVAs.

">Human Neocortical Glutamatergic Neurons Revealed Through Multimodal Profiling</a></h4>

              
                The human neocortex underlies higher cognition and is the engine of complex thought. Yet our understanding of its neuronal diversity is limited by sparse access to tissue, inconsistent sampling across studies, and a lack of multiple modality data. Although single-cell transcriptomic taxonomies are an important framework for characterizing cell type diversity, transcriptomic information alone cannot reveal the cellular properties that define neuronal computations. To address this, we performed Patch-seq, a method for collecting Morphology, Electrophysiology, and Transcriptomic data from a single neuron. We focused on glutamatergic, neocortical, excitatory neurons, the principal long-range projecting neurons of the cortex, and systematically integrated their morphoelectric features with transcriptomic identity. In combination with spatial transcriptomic data, we interrogated 39 of 42 transcriptomically-defined neuron types with a layer-centric perspective. Morphoelectric properties, such as cortical depth, apical dendrite structure, and excitability clearly distinguish transcriptomic subclasses and support many finer transcriptomic types. Morphoelectric properties are influenced by spatial location in supragranular layers, while deeper layers exhibit greater heterogeneity. Cross-species comparisons reveal conserved subclass organization but pronounced differences in apical dendrite arborization between mouse and human, and surprising similarities between human and macaque. Together, these datasets provide a unified multimodal reference that advances our understanding of human cortical circuitry and establishes a foundation for experimental and computational studies of human brain function and disease.

                Dysglycaemia is linked to brain atrophy, white-matter disruption and dementia risk, yet the directionality and mechanisms of glycemic-brain coupling remain unclear. Here we integrate large-scale GWAS of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes with multimodal brain imaging phenotypes and major brain disorders using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization. Across 4,040 tests, we identify 54 glycaemia and brain causal associations (FDR P < 0.05) and uncover a timescale-dependent hierarchy: short-term glycemic traits map to distributed macrostructure and functional-network, whereas long-term glycemic burden preferentially implicates long-range association and commissural white-matter pathways with focal prefrontal-paracentral vulnerability. Reverse analyses reveal 44 brain IDPs and glycaemia effects. Multi-trait Bayesian colocalization and tissue/cell type eQTL integration nominate shared causal loci enriched in glial and neurovascular pathways. Individual-level UK Biobank analyses validated glycaemia-associated brain structural alterations and non-linear risk patterns for incident outcomes. Together, our results provide a genetically anchored atlas of bidirectional glycemic-neural relationships, linking metabolic dysregulation to multiscale brain vulnerability and disorder risk.

">Emergent Traveling Waves in Neural Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks achieve striking performance but do not capture a prominent neural property. Cortical activity is organized by structured spatiotemporal dynamics, traveling waves (TW), which have been implicated in a wide range of functions. Existing computational models often rely on hand-crafted connectivity and imposed dynamics, offering insight into their impact but less into how the waves naturally emerge in biological circuits. Here, we found that TWs emerge in models under biologically plausible constraints (spatially organized, directionally biased connectivity). Under an empirical neural manifold constraint, these wiring principles naturally emerge to support traveling wave dynamics in the recurrent model. We further show that wave propagation provides a robust mechanism for maintaining working memory in the presence of visual distractors. We compared these model predictions to non-human primate prefrontal cortex recordings, revealing a similar mechanism. Together, these results advance our understanding of traveling waves as a substrate for cognition and offer a framework for mechanistic accounts of cortical computation.

">Specific targeting of layer 4 for direct cortical stimulation is not necessary to induce reliable perception</a></h4>

              
                The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) processes tactile inputs through microcircuits involving connections between and within layers. In particular, layer 4 is the main first cortical target of tactile inputs. However, the need for the initial activation of layer 4 neurons in order to generate a tactile percept has not been studied yet. Here, we investigated whether optogenetic activation of layer 4 neurons first is necessary to induce perception, or whether stimulation of neurons in other layers may suffice. To achieve this, we generated mouse profiles expressing a light-sensitive opsin in excitatory neurons in different combinations of cortical layers, including or excluding layer 4. We generated these profiles by combining transgenic mouse lines and peripheral injections of PHP.eB adeno-associated viruses. After providing proof-of-concept for neuronal optogenetic control in vivo with PHP.eB viruses, we trained mice in a task involving the discrimination of moving optogenetic stimuli projected onto the whisker S1 area, thanks to patterned photostimulation. Mice learned to track the position of a light bar in order to obtain rewards. Direct activation of layer 4 was sufficient for the mice to learn the task, but not necessary. Indeed, activation of all layers but layer 4 induced learning. Moreover, the simultaneous direct activation of all layers accelerated learning. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the cortical mechanisms underlying somatosensory perception. They could also help to optimize artificial sensory stimuli to provide efficient feedback in cortical neuroprostheses.

">Hierarchical processing and polarization encoding in the cephalopod visual system</a></h4>

              
                Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish, and squid; hereafter "cephalopods") have evolved a range of complex visually guided behaviors, from dexterous hunting to skin pattern based camouflage and communication (1). They have also evolved sensitivity to the polarization of light (2), an adaptation thought to help detect camouflaged or semitransparent predators and prey in low-visibility underwater environments (3-10). How visual information is processed by the cephalopod brain to support these behaviors remains unclear. Here, studying the bigfin reef squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana, we performed calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings from populations of neurons in the large visual center of the cephalopod brain, the optic lobe (OL). We found that the retina-recipient superficial OL contains a diversity of functionally distinct cell types, spatially organized into sublayers, that process spatiotemporal features of light intensity and exhibit polarization angle selectivity. More complex features, such as direction selectivity, are observed in deeper regions of the OL cortex, which also exhibit spontaneous waves of neural activity in the absence of visual input. Neurons in the downstream OL medulla exhibit visual receptive field sizes and spontaneous activity levels that increase with brain depth, consistent with hierarchical processing of visual information through the medulla's tree-like anatomical organization. Medulla neurons show sensitivity to local decreases in the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), which are integrated additively with light intensity information. Underwater imaging in the squid's natural habitat off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, demonstrates that polarization sensitivity provides a robust short-range increase in object-background contrast across a range of objects and environmental conditions. Together, these findings reveal convergent principles of hierarchical visual processing shared between cephalopods and vertebrates, and highlight how cephalopods exploit polarization sensitivity to solve fundamental visual challenges in underwater environments.

">Claustral Input Consolidates Anterior Cingulate Cortical States for Selective Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Efficient behavior depends on consolidating selective strategies that prioritize informative cues and suppress irrelevant signals. Previous studies have implicated the claustrum in coordinating cortical activity and large-scale brain states across behavioral contexts, yet its precise contribution to online behavioral control versus the consolidation of frontal control strategies remains unresolved. Here we combined large-scale Neuropixels recordings with targeted optogenetic perturbation of claustral neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex in behaving mice. During adaptation to altered task context and constraints, frontal cortical activity reorganized into a coordinated control regime characterized by sharpened encoding of task-relevant cues, suppression of non-instructive signals, structured low-frequency dynamics, and rapid transitions between population-level neural states. Temporally misaligned claustral signaling disrupted this reorganization, selectively impairing the consolidation of efficient, cue-selective strategies across sessions without affecting trial-by-trial task execution. These findings identify a role for the claustrum in shaping frontal dynamics that consolidate adaptive control strategies.

                As we age, understanding speech in social situations imposes an increasingly difficult challenge to the auditory system. However, the attentional mechanisms underlying age-related speech comprehension difficulties in multitalker situations remain unclear. We collected EEG signals while 63 normal hearing participants from 19 to 71 years performed a speech comprehension task involving a multitalker paradigm at individually adjusted target-to-distractor ratios. Combining trial-resolved multivariate temporal response function modeling with detailed behavioral comprehension responses, we provide a window into lower-level impairments and higher-level compensatory mechanisms across the adult life span. Neuro-behavioral correlations on a trial-by-trial level provide direct evidence for increased distractor representation underlying reduced behavioral performance in late adulthood. This points towards increased distractability as a potential mechanism underlying age-related speech comprehension deficits. Additionally, at the behavioral and neural levels, we show that older adults relied more on higher-level linguistic information. Finally, we show that an increased reliance on linguistic information may serve as a compensatory mechanism that supports comprehension performance across the adult life span. Summarizing, combining behavioral and neural data, we directly show that an increased reliance on linguistic processing can offset age-related impairments in attentional filtering.

">Dynamic control of Raf-ERK signaling modulates neuronal activity across biological scales</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity robustly engages the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway through Calcium-dependent mechanisms; however, whether ERK can acutely and causally modulates ongoing neuronal activity remains unsolved due to complex upstream regulation and diverse subcellular functions. Here, we directly address this question using an optogenetic ERK activator, opto-miniRaf, that enables selective, rapid, graded, and reversible control of ERK signaling. Combining this AAV-compatible system with calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we interrogate ERK functions across biological scales, from cultured neurons, acute brain slices, and the intact brain. Acute optogenetic activation of ERK enhances synchronized network burst activity in cultured rat cortical neurons and increases calcium activity of cortical pyramidal neurons in awake and moving mice following non-invasive light stimulation. Together, these results establish ERK signaling as an acute modulator of neuronal and network activity, positioning opto-miniRaf as a generalizable platform for precise spatiotemporal control of intracellular kinase signaling in complex biological systems.

In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we combine two-photon calcium imaging of cortical neurons and thalamo-cortical LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) boutons with simultaneous measurements of facial movements. When controlling for spurious time-structured 'nonsense' correlations, we observed representations of both eye movements and non-ocular facial movement features in both LGN bouton and V1 cortical neuron activity during grating input stimulation. Further, the correlation between V1 neurons and facial movement is larger for grating stimulation compared to blank stimulation, likely due to the integration of LGN inputs and modulation of V1 from higher brain centers during grating stimulation. Together, our results suggest a convergence of uninstructed non-visual signals from a persistent top-down pathway and a stimulus-gated bottom-up pathway in primary visual cortex.

">Pooling quantitative MRI data: A multi-protocol study of healthy subcortical ageing</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures relaxation rates, exchange rates and proton densities that reflect the biophysical properties of tissue and are ideally free from protocol- and scanner-dependence. In practice, qMRI has not yet achieved this level of independence from sequence and hardware choice, and quantitative measurements often differ across sites and acquisition schemes. At the same time pooling data across different sources can be beneficial to statistical power of longitudinal, cross-sectional or case-control studies. Here we investigate how protocol and hardware differences can affect pooling data from difference sources in large ultra high field (UHF) qMRI studies in the context of healthy aging. We combine the openly available ageing UHF qMRI MP2RAGEME-based dataset with two different MPM-based sets of qMRI data. We evaluate how pooling affects age dependence of qMRI parameters and investigate protocol-related biases, with a particular focus on subcortical structures. We focus the analysis, first, on replication and expansion of the reference qMRI dataset on normative aging, second, the examination of the protocol influence on the measured qMRI values, and third, on detecting the protocol effect on the age dependence inferred from the data. We find that the age-related changes for R1, R2* and volume detected by different protocols were of the same order of magnitude supporting the idea that age-related inter-individual variability can be correctly grasped across sites and protocols using qMRI approaches. We further observe larger relative difference across protocols for R1 and volume, while R2* remains more consistent for most regions. We therefore provide assessment of the pooling effects in the ultra-high resolution UHF qMRI data performed over a relatively large participant cohort, comprising data from different sites collected with different quantitative protocols.

">Novel model combining intrinsic and learned behaviours captures divergent effects of dopaminergic drugs on different types of motivation</a></h4>

              
                Motivation-based symptoms occur in an array of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Schizophrenia and Parkinson's Disease. Unfortunately, there is, as yet, no agreed treatment approach. To establish a better understanding of motivation, and so highlight potential avenues for treatment, motivation is often investigated using operant behavioural paradigms such as the Effort for Reward (EfR) task. Performance on these tasks is thought to be influenced by reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, such that disorders of motivation can be described in terms of altered interactions with RL processes. Recently, foraging behaviour has been increasingly adopted as an ethologically valid approach to investigating cognitive mechanisms, including motivation. One example of this is the recently developed Effort Based Foraging task (EBF). Foraging behaviour, unlike the strictly controlled and contrived operant behavioural paradigms, involves a series of complex behavioural processes, each potentially driven by different cognitive processes. It is therefore important to identify which portion of the foraging behavioural sequence is driven by the same RL mechanisms as classical operant behavioural paradigms, and therefore can be used to investigate motivation. In this work we set out to establish whether the same RL mechanisms could be used to account for behaviours observed in both EfR and EBF tasks. We identified where, within the EBF task, RL mechanisms were no long sufficient and developed a novel hybrid model of the behaviour. This model successfully accounted for external influences on motivation, including previously unpredicted effects of clinically used dopaminergic drugs. This work reveals that motivation in complex, naturalistic tasks cannot be fully explained by learning-based models alone. Incorporating intrinsic behavioural drives may be needed as neuroscience moves toward more ethological behavioural assays.

                High-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) generate large, complex datasets that are challenging to efficiently manage and analyze with existing tools, especially in open-source environments. To address this, we developed the BYU Seizure and Analytics Tool (YSA), an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) built in Python and C++ for efficient analysis and visualization of HD-MEA recordings. The YSA features raster plots, automated discharge detection and tracking, downsampling, playback, and export functions, enabling streamlined workflows for large-scale neural data. We demonstrate the utility of the tool in the context of seizure and status epilepticus (SE)-like activity, highlighting how the YSA facilitates rapid exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics in brain networks. This platform provides an accessible and practical solution for HD-MEA data analysis, supporting a range of neuroscience applications.

">Drowning a frog respiratory rhythm generator in a wash of excitation: State-dependent architecture of a ventilatory oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Breathing begins at birth and continues to death, providing a unique system to understand the architecture of rhythm-generating circuits in vertebrates. In mammals and frogs, three discrete rhythmogenic brainstem nuclei appear essential for generating different phases of breathing, with individual neurons intrinsically tuned to each phase. This discrete multi-oscillator architecture differs fundamentally from the distributed spinal locomotor networks, where rhythmogenesis spans multiple segments and the active phase of individual neurons depends on network state. However, whether these discrete respiratory oscillators are strictly essential and whether the phase of their neurons remains constant across states is coming under increasing scrutiny. Here, we focus on the frog buccal oscillator, which shares anatomical and functional similarities with the mammalian preBotzinger Complex. We developed a technique to silence motor neurons in frogs and mapped premotor unit activity within and surrounding the putative buccal oscillator under standard conditions and during heightened network excitability. We found that increasing network excitation caused the rhythmically active area to expand, in part by converting premotor lung units into buccal units. Next, we located the buccal area using excitatory and inhibitory microinjections and established the minimum number of inhibitory injections required to suppress buccal bursts. We then increased network excitability and again tested whether inhibitory microinjections could suppress the rhythm. While inhibitory microinjections could reverse local excitatory effects, they were unable to abolish the buccal rhythm under elevated excitation. Our data shows that not only does the region containing rhythmic premotor buccal units enlarge as network excitation increases, but the essential requirement for a discrete, rudimentary buccal oscillator is also lost. Thus, although rostral-caudal segments of the frog brainstem generally contribute to discrete phases of ventilatory motor patterns, our findings suggest that oscillator identity should be refined: oscillators should be viewed as promiscuous flexible functional entities that expand or contract to occupy different extents of the brainstem, rather than as fixed anatomical nuclei.

">Astrocytic Encoding of Threat in the Basolateral Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has long been implicated in threat detection and the generation of anxiety states. While previous experiments have demonstrated the important role of BLA principal neurons in driving anxiety-related behaviors, population-level recordings suggest that principal neurons encode broad exploratory states rather than anxiety per se. This discrepancy questions whether anxiety is indeed represented within the BLA, or if the BLA reflects a broader representation of behavioral states. Here, using simultaneous in vivo calcium recordings in both astrocytes and principal neurons in the BLA we find that in contrast to neurons, astrocytic activity provides a stable and scalable representation of threat-induced anxiety across an array of behavioral tasks. We find that the magnitude of astrocyte response to threatening stimuli is modulated by the individual anxiety levels of animals, and that exploration of anxiogenic environment can be decoded across multiple tasks using astrocyte activity alone. Our results shed light on a specialized encoding property of BLA astrocytes and establish these cells as key computational elements of threat processing in anxiety circuits.

">Temporal single-cell atlas of full-length Huntington's disease mouse model defines stage-specific signatures of corticostriatal dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease involves progressive corticostriatal dysfunction; however, the timing of region-specific transcriptional changes remains unresolved at cellular resolution. Here, we provide a temporal single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of striatum and motor cortex from zQ175 knock-in mice at 6 and 18 months. This full-length Huntingtin model enables staging of progressive circuit dysfunction. Striatal projection neurons show extensive early dysregulation with progressive striosomal identity erosion, whereas cortical pyramidal neuron dysfunction was layer-specific and coincided with motor symptom onset. By modeling genotype-dependent effects, we distinguish region- and cell type-specific signatures of core disease mechanisms from age-related changes and compensatory adaptations. Integrating gene co-expression and transcription factor regulatory networks, we predict candidate regulators of stage-specific dysfunction. These findings, validated across human HD and mouse model datasets, reveal temporal dynamics of disease pathogenesis in regionally distinct and interconnected neuronal populations, establishing a framework for understanding cell type-selective vulnerability.

">Bioengineered extracellular vesicles mitigate neuroinflammation by neutralizing pneumolysin and delaying disease onset in experimental pneumococcal meningitis</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening neurological disorder frequently caused by a Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) infection of the brain. Standard treatment consists of antibiotics to eliminate bacteria and dexamethasone to reduce inflammation. Despite this, mortality reaches 20% in treated individuals, and half of the survivors suffer long-term neurological sequelae. This is largely due to the poor capacity of antibiotics to reach the brain and the lack of antimicrobial treatment capable of neutralizing the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin (Ply). To address these limitations, we isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human HEK293T cells and evaluated their therapeutic potential in pneumococcal meningitis. Alongside wild-type EVs (WT.EVs), we bioengineered EVs to express RVG peptides (RVG.EV) for targeting neuronal acetylcholine receptors, signal incompetent IL-6 signal transducer (IL-6ST) decoy receptors (IL-6.EV) to block the pro-inflammatory signalling of IL-6, or EVs expressing both RVG peptides and IL-6ST (DB.EV). In vitro, all EVs reduced pneumococcal adhesion to neurons and mitigated cytotoxicity by binding and sequestering Ply. In a bacteremia-derived pneumococcal meningitis model, EV treatment significantly increased the survival of the mice without affecting bacterial load in the brain or the periphery. Among all groups, RVG.EV treatment was most effective in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the periphery and brain. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of bioengineered EVs, particularly RVG peptides expressing EVs, as an adjunctive treatment for pneumococcal meningitis thanks to their (i) sequestration and neutralization of Ply, (ii) increased blood-brain barrier crossing, and (iii) dampening of inflammation.

">Consumption of processed foods impairs memory function through dietary advanced glycation end-products</a></h4>

              
                Consumption of processed foods is associated with dementia, obesity, and other negative health outcomes. Sustained heat treatment, a common food processing approach to enhance flavor, induces the chemical Maillard reaction that promotes the formation of dietary advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). The neurocognitive impacts of consuming dietary AGEs are poorly understood. Here we modeled an AGE-rich diet through heat treatment fed to rats during adolescence, a critical period of neural development, to mechanistically evaluate the long-term impact of early life dietary AGEs on behavioral and neural processes. Consuming the AGE-rich diet impaired hippocampal-dependent memory function and altered the gut microbiome without inducing obesity or nonspecific behavioral deficits. AGE-induced memory deficits were coupled with impaired hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission and altered expression in the synapse-pruning complement system. Hippocampal synaptic deficits likely result from direct AGE-complement interactions, as our extended studies reveal competitive antagonist action of AGEs on complement receptors. Memory impairments were prevented by administration of the AGE-inhibitor, alagebrium, and by supplementation with an AGE-inhibiting bacterial taxon, Lactococcus lactis, which was depleted in the heat-treated diet. These findings reveal a functional connection between early life dietary AGEs, the microbiome, and memory impairments, thus illuminating mechanisms through which food processing negatively impacts neurocognition.

">Successful single-session neural self-regulation through neurofeedback varies between features</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback (NFB) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research seldom present within-session individual learning dynamics. This is even though a large proportion of NFB and BCI users cannot learn the neural self-regulation required to control the feedback. Understanding the time course and learning dynamics between subjects will enable us to design more effective NFB and BCI protocols that promote the learning of neural self-regulation. In this study, we aimed to analyze individual learning trajectories of self-regulation of four different cortical rhythms, in terms of both frequency and spatial selectivity. Twenty healthy subjects performed four sessions of NFB training, each session with feedback reflecting a different cortical rhythm as measured with an electroencephalogram. We specifically tested frontal midline (fm) Theta, occipital Alpha, unilateral centrotemporal sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), and central Beta. We show that all subjects were able to self-regulate at least two of these features, however, with varied specificity in the spatial and frequency domains. Unexpectedly, we show that none of the subjects succeeded in regulating fm Theta. Using a clustering approach, we identified two different learning dynamics among the learners across features: a linear increase/decrease and a non-linear plateau-like trajectory. This is the first NFB study employing an intra-subject cross-over experimental design, enabling the direct comparison of neural self-regulation between multiple features. Our results provide important insights into the "non-learner" problem, showing that it is not a feature-universal personal trait. We further show feature-specific spatial and frequency selectivity of neural self-regulation, providing important considerations for future NFB protocols.

">Exercise Leverages a Post-Stress Therapeutic Window in Hypothalamic CRH Neurons to Enable Recovery from Threat Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Exercise provides a range of benefits for physical and mental health. It relieves stress, yet paradoxically, it recruits the bodys stress response system. Here we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN) and the endocrine arm of the stress axis is necessary, but not sufficient for the beneficial effects of exercise. Specifically, glucocorticoids act synergistically with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on CRHPVN cells during exercise to reverse behavioral and synaptic sensitization after stress. In the absence of exercise, optogenetic activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor after stress is sufficient to reverse behavioral sensitization and synaptic metaplasticity. Our findings reveal a novel, time-sensitive mechanism by which exercise alleviates the impact of acute stress.

">Motor memory under sleep deprivation: Can physical exercise support consolidation?</a></h4>

              
                Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly prevalent and known to impair declarative memory, yet its impacts on the acquisition and consolidation of procedural skills remains unknown. Physical exercise has emerged as a promising intervention for promoting learning and plasticity, but its potential to mitigate SD-induced deficits has never been tested. Here, we investigated whether SD disrupts sequential motor learning (SML) and whether high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) performed after acquisition can influence consolidation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups combining one night of SD or normal sleep condition with HIIE or control intervention. SD elevated cortisol and sleepiness without affecting brain-derived neurotrophic factor or corticospinal excitability. Behaviorally, SD selectively impaired the movement time execution of SML acquisition, while HIIE reduced the movement accuracy during consolidation, regardless of sleep condition. These findings reveal a component-specific vulnerability of procedural memory to SD and challenge the assumption that exercise consistently enhances consolidation following motor learning.

">Modeling how contextual and structural biases shape duration perception</a></h4>

              
                Human time perception is flexible and shaped by both structural constraints and contextual influences. Disentangling these sources of bias is essential for understanding the predictive mechanisms underlying temporal perception, yet no unified model currently integrates them. Here, we quantified precisely the structural and contextual biases in a duration discrimination task to constrain models of duration perception. Using a duration discrimination task, healthy participants judged which of two consecutive stimuli lasted longer. Stimuli were visual, auditory, or cross-modal. Consistent with previous findings, auditory stimuli were perceived as longer than visual stimuli of equal duration, reflecting intrinsic properties of audiovisual neural processing. Contextual biases were manipulated through different duration distributions known to influence temporal judgments. Our results show that duration discrimination relies on distinct representations of each stimulus distribution and is best explained by a combination of Bayesian inference and rescaling. While Bayesian inference accounts for contextual effects such as regression to the mean, rescaling mechanisms predict opposite effects by correcting perceived durations after repeated exposure. These findings challenge existing accounts of contextual effects in time perception and suggest that the brain normalizes temporal representations to adapt to environmental statistics.

">Acute, low-grade inflammation elevates white matter sensitivity to ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic brain injuries, including stroke, are highly prevalent neurological diseases. Acute, low-grade inflammation, often resulting from peripheral infection, is a recognised risk factor. White matter axons, and their supporting glia, are susceptible to both ischemic and neuroinflammatory injury. The mechanisms behind ischemic and severe inflammatory injury in white matter are well established. However, the white matter response to acute, low-grade inflammation, and how this can interact with co-morbidities such as cerebral ischemia are yet to be examined. Here, we examine the response of white matter to acute, low-grade inflammation and the downstream effects this had on sensitivity of ischemia. Ex vivo mouse optic nerve and corpus callosum, central white matter tracts, tolerated acute, low-grade inflammation (110-minutes, 0.1ug/ml LPS), with preserved action potential conduction, limited microglial activation and no axo-myelinic damage. Exposure to these conditions elevated indicators of stress in oligodendrocytes which, when exposed to ischemic conditions (30 minutes oxygen-glucose deprivation), impaired their ability to maintain healthy myelin. There was a resulting increase in axo-myelinic damage and functional decline associated with ischemic conditions compared to white matter that had not been pre-exposed to LPS. Microglial depletion or dampening microglial responses with the clinically available drug minocycline eliminated the elevated sensitivity of white matter to ischemic injury associated with acute, low-grade inflammation. We demonstrate that acute, low-grade neuroinflammation primes white matter for heightened vulnerability to ischemic injury through microglial-mediated mechanisms. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of ischemic brain injury observed during systemic inflammatory states and highlights microglial modulation as a clinical strategy to mitigate ischemic damage in susceptible patients.

">Global context rapidly shapes sensory responses in V1</a></h4>

              
                Context modulates sensory processing in the cerebral cortex by suppressing responses to expected stimuli and enhancing responses to unexpected ones. Recent proposals argue that early sensory areas such as primary visual cortex (V1) are shaped only by local context, including recent stimulus history, whereas modulation by global context, such as learned temporal structure, is present exclusively in higher cortical areas. This view is incompatible with predictive coding theories. To directly dissociate local and global contextual influences, we used a global/local oddball paradigm in which mice viewed five-item sequences. Across conditions, sequence structure was held constant while stimulus identity and predictability were selectively manipulated, allowing the isolation of response modulations due to local deviance, global expectation, and stimulus repetition independently. In the canonical sequence (AAAA-B), B is locally deviant but globally predictable. Using two-photon calcium imaging and LFP recordings in mouse V1, we found that global predictability abolished context modulation: responses to B were equivalent to those evoked by a random sequence control (e.g., CDEAB). This effect emerged rapidly, after only <10 sequence repetitions, demonstrating fast learning of global structure. When the stimulus was globally deviant, either by replacing B with a novel stimulus (AAAA-C) or by presenting B unpredictably in a standard oddball paradigm, V1 exhibited robust response enhancement. These effects required feedback from anterior cingulate area (ACa), establishing a causal role for higher cortical circuits in conveying global predictions to V1. Strikingly, when an additional A replaced B (AAAA-A), responses were strongly suppressed despite global deviance, indicating that stimulus-specific adaptation may constrain the expression of global prediction error signals in early sensory cortex.

">Acute electrical neuromodulation paradigms restore firing behavior and inhibition in secondary brain injury: A computational study.</a></h4>

              
                Secondary Brain Injury (SBI) occurs after the initial physical insult caused due to traumatic brain injuries and strokes. SBI leads to a massive loss of brain functionalities if timely intervention is not administered. This work analyses the delineated effects of three acute SBI processes in two-neuron motifs and shows that the right stimulation paradigm during specific key SBI events help restore firing rate trends in neurons. The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is extended to theoretically model two categories of two-neuron motifs: a feedforward excitatory motif (Motif 1: Two pyramidal neurons with glutamatergic synapses) and a feedforward inhibitory motif (Motif 2: One pyramidal neuron and one interneuron with GABAergic synapses). Three important SBI processes in the motifs were modeled: glutamate excitotoxicity, increased extracellular potassium ion concentration, and cellular energy deficit. Firing rate trend analysis is performed for increasing severity of SBI processes, and interesting points (key events) are identified. A wide range of ACS and DBS stimulation parameters are applied to the motifs during these key events to assess the firing rate response during stimulation. Increasing SBI severity caused an overall increase in excitation, synchronizing neuronal activities in Motif 1 and reducing inhibition in Motif 2. Alternate current stimulation paradigms were found to desynchronize and regulate neuronal firing in Motif 1. Deep brain stimulation parameters were found to increase inhibition in Motif 2, thereby helping to maintain the excitation-inhibition balance. The right stimulation paradigm administered at appropriate key events helps regulate neuronal firing, thereby reducing the metabolic burden on the neurons during acute SBI.

">A Joint Tau Propagation and Neuroinflammation Model Reinforces Inflammatory Modulation of Network-Driven Spread in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Despite over a century of research, AD remains untreatable due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. While amyloid beta has dominated therapeutic efforts, tau pathology and neuroinflammation represent critical disease drivers and intriguing therapeutic targets. We developed an extended computational model building upon the open-source Aggregation Network Diffusion (AND) framework by coupling spatial tau propagation and aggregation with ordinary differential equations representing key inflammatory cascades. The model incorporates M1/M2 microglia and astrocytic activation, cytokine-mediated feedback loops, and neuronal loss, all modulated via region-specific genetic expression matrices of ApoE and TREM2 with variant-specific weighting. The model maintains biologically plausible tau dynamics while generating robust inflammatory marker trends, serving as a computational testbed for hypothesis generation and mechanistic exploration. The inflammatory components independently capture experimental observations and display a marked M1/M2 microglia divergence. The model demonstrates enhanced similarity to regional tau propagation patterns due to inflammatory and genetic components, reinforcing neuroinflammation's role in tau spread and highlighting the need to incorporate these processes in modeling efforts. Finally, through parsimony analysis, we identify microglia and pro-inflammatory rates (including microglia-facilitated tau spread) as key contributors to improved model accuracy, informing future modeling approaches.

">Retrograde transduction of dopaminergic cells in substantia nigra of rhesus monkey</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory systems regulate neural circuits across broad regions of the brain, and disruption of the dopaminergic system contributes to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Engineered viral vectors have been used to target the neuromodulatory systems of the nonhuman primate brain (Y. Chen et al., 2023; El-Shamayleh et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2010; Lerchner et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2022). However, a conspicuous obstacle to the isolation and modulation of specific pathways is the inability of many retrogradely infecting viruses to transduce dopaminergic (DA) cells efficiently (Tervo et al., 2016; Cushnie et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020). We compare the DA neuron retrograde transduction efficacy of four viral vectors after injection into the striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP). Selectivity was assessed by comparing the neuronal co-expression of fluorescent reporter protein and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) antibody in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The rabies pseudotyped lentiviral vector, FuG-B2, produced superior retrograde transduction of DA cells to FuG-C or FuG-E. AAV2.retro was the least effective.

">A Glycaemia-Prolonging Carbohydrate Gel Reduces Hunger and Cognitive Fatigue During Prolonged Esports Play</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged esports play can induce cognitive fatigue by placing sustained demands on executive control, decision-making, and stress regulation. Since the brain relies primarily on glucose as an immediate energy source, we hypothesized that a carbohydrate gel designed to prolong post-ingestion glycaemia stabilizes interstitial glucose, attenuates hunger and cognitive fatigue, and helps preserve performance during extended esports play. Eleven healthy young men completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study with two sessions in which they ingested one of two carbohydrate gels matched for total energy and total carbohydrate but differing in carbohydrate composition (high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]-dominant vs maltodextrin [MDX]-dominant) before gameplay. Interstitial glucose was monitored continuously, while hunger, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, executive function, and in-game performance were assessed repeatedly. Compared with the control (HFCS-dominant) condition, the glycaemia-prolonging formulation maintained higher interstitial glucose levels during the later phase of gameplay, blunted the progressive increase in hunger, and attenuated cortisol responses. These physiological and subjective advantages were accompanied by better executive control and more adaptive defensive behaviors in-game, including fewer fouls and more interceptions. In contrast, pupil diameter, an index of global arousal, remained unchanged across conditions, suggesting that benefits were not driven by altered arousal but by improved glycaemic stability and appetite regulation. These findings indicate that a carbohydrate formulation that prolongs glycaemia can reduce hunger-linked cognitive fatigue and support task-relevant behavior during prolonged esports play. This low-burden nutritional strategy may help sustain mental performance during prolonged digital activities that impose high cognitive demands.

">Attention modulates neural representations of acoustic, categorical, and identity features in a task-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Aims The human auditory system represents sounds at multiple levels, from low-level acoustic features to abstract category- and object-level information. Although selective auditory attention enables listening in complex soundscapes, it remains unclear which representational levels are modulated by attention and how this depends on scene structure. Using fMRI, representational similarity analysis (RSA), and cross-experiment decoding, this study examined how attention modulates neural representations of sound features under different competitive listening conditions. Methods Twenty participants completed an fMRI experiment involving three selective attention conditions: one sound presented alone, three overlapping sounds from different categories, and three overlapping sounds from the same category. Neural activation patterns were compared to models of multiple low-level acoustic and abstract sound features using RSA, with covariance between models statistically removed to isolate unique representations. Attentional modulation was quantified by contrasting representations of attended and ignored sound features, and cross-experiment decoding was used to assess object-identity representations. Conclusions Low-level acoustic features were robustly represented in early auditory cortex, whereas abstract sound features were broadly represented along temporal and frontal regions of the auditory ventral stream. Attentional modulation was task-dependent: when competing sounds could not be distinguished by category, attention enhanced low-level acoustic feature processing, whereas in cross-category scenes attention primarily targeted abstract category-level representations. Object-identity representations were modulated by attention across both scene types, with category-specific differences. These findings demonstrate that auditory attention flexibly targets the representational level most informative for resolving competition in complex soundscapes.

">Mapping subcortical fear pathways in the human brain: thalamo-amygdala connections revealed by high-resolution tractography</a></h4>

              
                Influential models of emotion have postulated the existence of several direct subcortical pathways, or ''low roads'', that convey fast sensory thalamic inputs to the amygdala for affective processing. In rodents and non-human primates, specific thalamo-amygdala connections have been identified and linked to fear responses. These connections mainly originate in three thalamic nuclear groups (posterior, intralaminar, and medial) and project to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the existence of similar thalamo-amygdala pathways in humans remains uncertain. Here, aiming to reproduce subcortical amygdala connections previously described in the non-human animal literature, we mapped those tracts in 113 human participants of either sex. We implemented an advanced high-resolution tractography protocol optimized for reliably tracing axonal pathways through regions with complex white-matter architecture. We reconstructed white matter tracts connecting thalamic nuclei to the BLA, and assessed their test-retest reproducibility to evaluate their anatomical plausibility. Among posterior thalamic nuclei, projections from the medial geniculate nucleus and the medial and inferior pulvinar to the BLA emerged as the strongest and most robust thalamo-amygdala pathways. In turn, the mediodorsal nucleus within the medial group exhibited a prominent connection to the BLA, with a high number of streamlines and moderate-to-high reliability across sessions. Finally, intralaminar thalamic nuclei (parafascicular, central medial, and centromedian) showed consistent connections to the BLA, albeit with higher intrasubject variability and moderate-to-low reproducibility. Together, these findings provide a unifying anatomical framework for multiple direct thalamo-amygdala pathways in the human brain, and suggest the existence of distinct evolutionarily conserved routes for subcortical affective processing.

">Neural representations supporting generalization under continual learning</a></h4>

              
                Abstraction and generalization are essential for flexible decision-making in novel situations. Recent work in humans and monkeys has shown how abstract variables are encoded by the representational geometry of neural population activity. However, these observations--which are typically made after learning has converged--demonstrate the product of abstraction, but not the process by which abstract knowledge is learned: how are the inputs from concrete experiences transformed into abstract knowledge, and how do neural circuits perform these operations and relay this knowledge? To address these questions, we developed a factorized model of temporal abstraction that builds on the successor representation. The model disentangles the contributions of different levels of abstract learning--from stimulus-stimulus associations to a generalizable task schema--in the form of a factorized prediction error that relates the change in relational knowledge to a predicted change in representational geometry on each trial. We fit the model to the behavior of human participants performing a context-dependent decision task during fMRI. The model captured the learning dynamics at multiple timescales, including the increasing contribution of generalization as participants transferred abstracted relational knowledge between novel task instances. In fMRI, BOLD activity in hippocampus--where, in past work, abstract knowledge was represented after learning--was increasingly attributed to the acquisition of abstract knowledge based on generalization. A similar temporal pattern was observed in entorhinal cortex, a putative source of low-dimensional structural information, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which may depend on relational knowledge to represent state relationships as a cognitive map that guides choices. Indeed, individual variation in the generalization signal in OFC correlated with behavioral performance on key trials that required relational knowledge. Our findings show how the brain regions previously shown to represent abstract knowledge after learning also support the process of abstraction as it evolves from learning concrete associations to a generalizable schema. Our approach offers a computational framework for disentangling the operations driving abstract learning and probing their neural correlates in the dynamics of representational geometry.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Social touch facilitates our attachment to others, especially early in life, which may be linked to the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons (PVI) in the somatosensory cortex (S1). These neurons respond to social touch, mature in a sensory experience-dependent manner, and influence both somatosensory processing and social behavior in models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Prairie voles (<span style="font-style:italic;">Microtus ochrogaster</span>) are an ideal rodent model for studying these concepts since they engage in a species-typical social touch called “huddling.” In this study, we first found that over development from juvenile to adult, same-sex siblings showed a reduction in huddling and an increase in time investigating one another or behaving apart. Next, we tracked two markers of plasticity indicative of PVI maturation, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) and nuclear transcription factor Myocyte enhancing factor 2C (Mef2c)—across seven developmental timepoints. We found that, while PV expression in S1 was stable by P21, PNNs, and Mef2c continued to shift afterwards, indicating a protracted development. Finally, to determine environmental factors affecting these processes, environmental enrichment between P21 to P28 advanced PVI maturation, and increased conspecific investigation consistent with adult behavior. This developmental mapping provides a particularly salient model to investigate the molecular underpinnings of cortical and social development.</span>

                Background Ternary ABX2 semiconductors, in which A represents silver, B denotes indium, and X signifies tellurium, have garnered growing interest for optoelectronic applications owing to their advantageous optical band gaps and carrier transport characteristics. Among these materials, AgInTe2 has proven to be a promising absorber for high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic applications. Layer thickness optimization is a critical factor that impacts device efficiency. Methods Numerical simulations were conducted utilizing the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in One Dimension (SCAPS-1D) to assess the influence of layer thickness on the efficacy of an AgInTe2-based solar cell. The device architecture comprised an aluminum antimonide window layer, an AgInTe2 absorber layer, and a barium silicide rear layer. The thicknesses of the window, absorber, and rear layers were methodically varied. Key photovoltaic parameters, such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, were derived from the simulations. Results The simulation results indicate that the efficacy of the device is highly contingent upon the thickness of each individual layer. An optimized configuration with window, absorber, and back layer thicknesses of 0.1 micrometers, 0.6 micrometers, and 0.2 micrometers, respectively, resulted in a maximal power conversion efficiency of 32.6%. This enhancement is ascribed to improved carrier generation and collection, coupled with diminished recombination losses within the device. Conclusions The study illustrates that meticulous optimization of layer thickness substantially improves the efficiency of AgInTe2-based solar cells. The proposed device architecture offers valuable design principles for the development of high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic devices.

                Objective This study aims to evaluate spermatogenic failure in azoospermic men by characterizing patterns in Modified Johnsen Scores from testicular biopsies, examining their correlation with clinical and hormonal parameters, and determining the probability of live sperm retrieval. Novelty As the largest dataset on azoospermia in Indonesia, this study provides a comprehensive histopathological and hormonal profile of azoospermic patients, while also emphasizing the diagnostic value of bilateral testicular biopsies—an area often underexplored in Southeast Asian populations. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on azoospermic patients who underwent bilateral testicular biopsies between April 2011 and July 2024. Testicular tissue samples were assessed using the Modified Johnsen scoring system (range: 1 to 10), and classified histopathologically from tubular fibrosis to complete spermatogenesis. Clinical parameters including age, body mass index, sperm retrieval outcomes, and serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were collected and analyzed. Statistical associations between these parameters and histopathological subtypes were determined using significance testing. Results A total of 409 testicular biopsies were evaluated. The most frequent Modified Johnsen Scores were 7 (20%) and 5 (16.6%). Histopathological analysis showed that 40.3% of cases exhibited spermatogenic arrest, while only 7% demonstrated normal spermatogenesis. Discordant histopathological patterns between the two testes were observed in 18.5% of patients. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels showed statistically significant associations with histopathological subtypes (p < 0.001). Age, body mass index, and testosterone levels did not correlate significantly. Conclusion Spermatogenic arrest is the predominant abnormality in azoospermic men, with hormonal variations—particularly in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone—strongly associated with testicular pathology. The presence of discordant histology between testes underscores the importance of bilateral biopsies. Higher Modified Johnsen Scores were positively correlated with the likelihood of successful sperm retrieval.

                We report a single case history of successful treatment of female genital mutilation with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. There were other vaginal pain issues. Variations to the standard protocol are noted. For example, substituting target decomposition over the safe place procedure. We demonstrate that EMDR is a possible treatment for FGM. We cannot find any previous case report of EMDR and FGM.

                Background Institutional legitimacy—the belief that authorities are just and deserving of compliance—depends on the interplay of participation, pluralism, transparency, and trust. This study applies the Voice–Choice–Transparency–Trust (VCTT) framework to construct a composite institutional quality index (INST) and to identify how elite behaviour, market structure, inequality, and development jointly shape legitimacy across countries. The analysis bridges the conceptual divide between extractive and value-creating power by empirically testing how elite quality and market concentration interact to affect institutional outcomes. Methods Using an unbalanced panel of 22 countries from 2000 to 2004, the study combines hierarchical multiple imputation with panel econometrics. Institutional quality (INST) was derived from standardised VCTT pillars. Core regressors include the Elite Quality Index (EQx), market power (mark-up), the Gini coefficient, and GDP per capita. Two complementary estimators were applied: a fixed-effects (pooled OLS) model and a Mundlak correlated random-effects model, both corrected for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence using Driscoll–Kraay robust standard errors. Results The fixed-effects model shows that higher Elite index values strongly improve institutional quality (p < 0.01), whereas greater market concentration significantly reduces it (p < 0.01). Moderate inequality displays a small but positive association with institutional stability (p < 0.05). The Mundlak model confirms a positive within-country effect of elite quality (p = 0.004) and a negative effect of rising domestic inequality (p = 0.046). Between-country averages reveal that nations with productive elites and moderate inequality sustain stronger institutions, while persistent market dominance undermines them. Conclusions Across the sample, institutional legitimacy strengthens where elites are value-creating and markets remain competitive. Concentrated market power erodes institutional quality, and inequality’s influence is context-dependent—detrimental when it widens domestically but neutral or stabilising when moderate. Balanced power relations, therefore, underpin transparent, accountable, and trusted institutions within the VCTT framework.

                Background Reducing maternal and neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges within the healthcare system. Effective upward referral systems play a crucial role in ensuring timely emergency care for obstetric complications in the healthcare system. The aim of this study is to understand the factors (antecedents) and defining characteristics (attributes) that influence upward referrals of obstetric emergencies. from Community Health Centres to higher-level hospitals in the OR Tambo district, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods Data were collected through document analysis, observations, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, consisting of 59 participants, using a qualitative grounded theory approach. Results The study reveals a complex web of interrelated antecedents and attributes that influence the effectiveness of upward referrals in obstetric emergencies. While formal protocols exist, referral decisions are often undermined by systemic barriers. The findings suggest that the lack of coordination between referring and receiving facilities, coupled with fragmented feedback systems, hampers continuity of care. Despite these challenges, instances of effective referral were observed in settings where interprofessional collaboration, timely information sharing, and adequate preparation of patients were prioritised. Conclusion Effective upward referral of obstetric emergencies depends on timely decision-making, adequate patient preparation, clear communication, and inter-facility collaboration. This highlights the need for an integrated approach that strengthens health system functions, which are essential to reducing preventable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in resource-constrained settings like South Africa.

                Background The acardiac fetus is a rare malformation specific to multiple monozygotic pregnancies. Two main theories have been proposed regarding the etiology of this malformation: the vascular theory, and the second supposes a defect in the embryogenesis of the heart. Diagnosis is typically suspected and confirmed based on ultrasound findings. Case presentation We present the case of a 36-year-old woman, G3P4, with a bi-scarred uterus. The last pregnancy was a monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy complicated by an acardiac fetus suspected in the first trimester and confirmed by ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation. She gave birth by an emergency cesarean section at 34 weeks + 4 days to two babies: a normal female baby and an acardiac fetus. Conclusion Acardiac twin pregnancies present challenges and require careful management to optimize outcomes for both the acardiac and the healthy twins. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this condition is crucial to provide effective prenatal care and support.

                Background This experimental study evaluates the structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams incorporating walnut shell fine aggregate (WFA) and 15% powdered waste glass (PWG). Method Eight simply-supported RC beams were cast and tested in two series: Group 1 (beams with transverse stirrups i.e. flexure-dominated) and Group 2 (beams without stirrups i.e. shear-dominated). Mixes included a control (0% WFA) and three WFA replacement levels (10%, 20%, 30% by volume of sand), with PWG fixed at 15% of cement in all mixes. Tests included 28-day compressive strength, density measurements, and two-point bending load–deflection tests. Results Results show that 10% WFA replacement enhanced compressive strength by 3–5%, flexural capacity by ~6%, and ductility by 64%, while reducing density by 6–8%. Higher WFA contents reduced stiffness but improved energy absorption and crack distribution. Conclusions The findings confirm that moderate WFA replacement (≤10%) combined with PWG yields eco-efficient RC beams with improved ductility and reduced dead load.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>While the hippocampus has intrigued generations of neuroscientists for its contributions to cognitive and emotional processing, functional specialization along its longitudinal axis confers particular importance to the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in affective regulation under normal and pathological conditions. In particular, vHPC is extensively linked to the encoding, expression, and extinction of fear memories, which mediate behavioral adaptation to environmental threats. Despite decades of research, however, many questions remain about precisely what is encoded among specific populations of vHPC neurons and what brain systems cooperate in processing this information during fear regulation. Furthermore, as insights accumulate into the function of discrete afferent projections of vHPC, an important area of focus is how vHPC circuitry might be organized to support different output patterns through synaptic integration. Here, we summarize the current understanding of these issues based on contemporary circuit-based approaches and highlight potential clues to the anatomical and functional organization of synaptic networks that may help reconceptualize vHPC as a system of interacting modules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-19/v1?src=rss">Inspiratory Muscle Training plus Pulmonary Rehabilitation versus Rehabilitation alone in COPD A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an established intervention for COPD, but the added value of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) within PR remains uncertain. This systematic review examined whether IMT plus PR provides benefits beyond PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD. Methods PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IMT+PR with PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD were included. Primary outcomes were inspiratory muscle strength (PImax), dyspnea, health related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity [six minute walk test (6MWT)], and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Results Nine RCTs (n=295) met the inclusion criteria. IMT+PR improved PImax in 6/9 studies, with gains of 5.2 to 22.9 cmH2O. Dyspnea improved in 6/8 studies, often exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). HRQoL improved in all studies assessing this outcome (6/6), although superiority of IMT+PR over PR or control conditions was not consistently demonstrated. Exercise capacity findings were mixed, with significant within-group 6MWT gains in 4 of 7 studies but inconsistent between-group differences. PFTs (FEV1, FVC) were generally unchanged, while limited data from single-center trials suggest reductions in dynamic hyperinflation and small increases in inspiratory capacity. Conclusion Adding IMT to PR meaningfully improves PImax and HRQoL in moderate to severe COPD, with frequent but less consistent benefits for dyspnea and 6MWT performance and minimal effect on spirometry. IMT may be most appropriate for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness (PImax <60 cmH2O or <50% predicted). Further RCTs should define optimal IMT protocols and clarify which COPD phenotypes derive the greatest benefit.

                Background Peristaltic or undulating flow plays a significant role in various biomedical and industrial processes, where it provides an efficient mechanism for transporting fluids through flexible conduits such as catheters and endoscopic channels. Understanding such flow behavior is essential for improving medical devices and industrial applications involving non-Newtonian fluids. Methods This study investigates the peristaltic motion of a Carreau fluid whose viscosity varies with both temperature and concentration within a flexible, axisymmetric channel composed of two overlapping cylindrical tubes. The outer wall of the channel exhibits a sinusoidal wave pattern, simulating a realistic endoscopic configuration. The governing nonlinear, nonhomogeneous partial differential equations were formulated in cylindrical coordinates under the assumption of a long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The equations were transformed into a dimensionless form and solved using the uniform perturbation method. Graphical analyses were performed using Mathematica software. Results The results illustrate the combined effects of temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent viscosity on the velocity distribution and pressure gradient within the channel. Increasing temperature and solute concentration were found to enhance fluid velocity and reduce flow resistance. Conclusions The study provides a comprehensive understanding of peristaltic transport in variable-viscosity Carreau fluids under realistic physiological conditions. These findings may contribute to optimizing the design and performance of endoscopic and biomedical fluid transport systems.
