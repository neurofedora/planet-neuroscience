              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Intrinsic functional connectivity in the default mode network predicts mnemonic discrimination: A connectome‐based modeling approach</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to distinguish existing memories from similar perceptual experiences is a core feature of episodic memory. This ability is often examined using the mnemonic similarity task in which people discriminate memories of studied objects from perceptually similar lures. Studies of the neural basis of such mnemonic discrimination have mostly focused on hippocampal function and connectivity. However, default mode network (DMN) connectivity may also support such discrimination, given that the DMN includes the hippocampus, and its connectivity supports many aspects of episodic memory. Here, we used connectome-based predictive modeling to identify associations between intrinsic DMN connectivity and mnemonic discrimination. We leveraged a wide range of abilities across healthy younger and older adults to facilitate this predictive approach. Resting-state functional connectivity in the DMN predicted mnemonic discrimination outside the MRI scanner, especially among prefrontal and temporal regions and including several hippocampal regions. This predictive relationship was stronger for younger than older adults, primarily for temporal–prefrontal connectivity. The novel associations established here are consistent with mounting evidence that broader cortical networks including the hippocampus support mnemonic discrimination. They also suggest that age-related network disruptions undermine the extent that the DMN supports this ability. This study provides the first indication of how intrinsic functional properties of the DMN support mnemonic discrimination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal–prefrontal interactions during spatial decision‐making</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has been linked to memory encoding and spatial navigation, while the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive functions such as decision-making. These regions are hypothesized to communicate in tasks that demand both spatial navigation and decision-making processes. However, the electrophysiological signatures underlying this communication remain to be better elucidated. To investigate the dynamics of the hippocampal–prefrontal interactions, we have analyzed their local field potentials and spiking activity recorded from rats performing a spatial alternation task on a figure eight-shaped maze. We found that the phase coherence of theta peaked around the choice point area of the maze. Moreover, Granger causality revealed a hippocampus → prefrontal cortex directionality of information flow at theta frequency, peaking at starting areas of the maze, and on the reverse direction at delta frequency, peaking near the turn onset. Additionally, the patterns of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling within and between the regions also showed spatial selectivity, and hippocampal theta and prefrontal delta modulated not only gamma amplitude but also inter-regional gamma synchrony. Finally, we found that the theta rhythm dynamically modulated neurons in both regions, with the highest modulation at the choice area; interestingly, prefrontal cortex neurons were more strongly modulated by the hippocampal theta rhythm than by their local field rhythm. In all, our results reveal maximum electrophysiological interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex near the decision-making period of the spatial alternation task, corroborating the hypothesis that a dynamic interplay between these regions takes place during spatial decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Muscarinic (M1) cholinergic receptor activation within the dorsal hippocampus promotes destabilization of strongly encoded object location memories</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the initial consolidation process, memories can become reactivated by exposure to a reminder of the original learning event. This can lead to the memory becoming destabilized and vulnerable to disruption or other forms of modification. The memory must then undergo the protein-synthesis dependent process of reconsolidation in order to be retained. However, older and/or stronger memories resist destabilization, but can become labile when reactivated in the presence of salient novelty. We have implicated the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acting at M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) within perirhinal cortex (PRh), in novelty-induced destabilization of remote object memories. It remains unclear, however, whether mAChRs are involved in destabilization of other forms of memory. We hypothesized that the role of M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs previously demonstrated for PRh-dependent object memory would extend to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Using the object location (OL) task, which relies on the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), we showed that (a) reactivation-dependent reconsolidation of OL memories requires protein synthesis within the dHPC; (b) destabilization of relatively weak OL memories depends on M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC; (c) salient novelty during reactivation promotes destabilization of resistant strongly encoded OL memories; (d) novelty-induced destabilization of strong OL memories requires activation of mAChRs within the dHPC; and (e) M<sub>1</sub> mAChR activation within the dHPC in the absence of novelty during memory reactivation mimics the effect of novelty, destabilizing strongly encoded OL memories. These results implicate ACh acting at M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs in the destabilization of dHPC-dependent spatial memories, demonstrating generalizability of this cholinergic function beyond memory for object identity. These findings therefore enhance our understanding of the dynamics of long-term memory storage and suggest implications for the treatment of human conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are characterized by behavioral and mnemonic inflexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">London taxi drivers: A review of neurocognitive studies and an exploration of how they build their cognitive map of London</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Licensed London taxi drivers have been found to show changes in the gray matter density of their hippocampus over the course of training and decades of navigation in London (UK). This has been linked to their learning and using of the “<i>Knowledge of London</i>,” the names and layout of over 26,000 streets and thousands of points of interest in London. Here we review past behavioral and neuroimaging studies of London taxi drivers, covering the structural differences in hippocampal gray matter density and brain dynamics associated with navigating London. We examine the process by which they learn the layout of London, detailing the key learning steps: systematic study of maps, travel on selected overlapping routes, the mental visualization of places and the optimal use of subgoals. Our analysis provides the first map of the street network covered by the routes used to learn the network, allowing insight into where there are gaps in this network. The methods described could be widely applied to aid spatial learning in the general population and may provide insights for artificial intelligence systems to efficiently learn new environments.</p>

                Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) represents a disfiguring and potentially blinding autoimmune component of Graves’ disease. It appears to be driven, at least in part, by autoantibodies targeting the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)/insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) complex. Actions mediated through either TSHR or IGF-IR are dependent on IGF-IR activity. CD34+ fibrocytes,...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Time-varying pitch is a vital cue for human speech perception. Neural processing of time-varying pitch has been extensively assayed using scalp-recorded frequency-following responses (FFRs), an electrophysiological signal thought to reflect integrated phase-locked neural ensemble activity from subcortical auditory areas. Emerging evidence increasingly points to a putative contribution of auditory cortical ensembles to the scalp-recorded FFRs. However, the properties of cortical FFRs and precise characterization of laminar sources are still unclear. Here we used direct human intracortical recordings as well as extracranial and intracranial recordings from macaques and guinea pigs to characterize the properties of cortical sources of FFRs to time-varying pitch patterns. We found robust FFRs in the auditory cortex across all species. We leveraged representational similarity analysis as a translational bridge to characterize similarities between the human and animal models. Laminar recordings in animal models showed FFRs emerging primarily from the thalamorecipient layers of the auditory cortex. FFRs arising from these cortical sources significantly contributed to the scalp-recorded FFRs via volume conduction. Our research paves the way for a wide array of studies to investigate the role of cortical FFRs in auditory perception and plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Minimizing Iridium Oxide Electrodes for High Visual Acuity Subretinal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Vision loss from diseases of the outer retina, such as age-related macular degeneration, is among the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the world today. The goal of retinal prosthetics is to replace the photo-sensing function of photoreceptors lost in these diseases with optoelectronic hardware to electrically stimulate patterns of retinal activity corresponding to vision. To enable high-resolution retinal prosthetics, the scale of stimulating electrodes must be significantly decreased from current designs; however, this reduces the amount of stimulating current that can be delivered. The efficacy of subretinal stimulation at electrode sizes suitable for high visual acuity retinal prosthesis are not well understood, particularly within the safe charge injection limits of electrode materials. Here, we measure retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses in a mouse model of blindness to evaluate the stimulation efficacy of 10, 20, and 30 &mu;m diameter iridium oxide electrodes within the electrode charge injection limits, focusing on measures of charge threshold and dynamic range. Stimulation thresholds were lower for smaller electrodes, but larger electrodes could elicit a greater dynamic range of spikes and recruited more ganglion cells within charge injection limits. These findings suggest a practical lower limit for planar electrode size and indicate strategies for maximizing stimulation thresholds and dynamic range.</p>

                Background: Natural products with antibacterial potential have begun to be tested on biofilm models, bringing us closer to understanding the response generated by the complex microbial ecosystems of the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities and chemical compositions of Peruvian propolis in an in vitro biofilm of Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Methods: The experimental work involved a consecutive, in vitro, longitudinal, and double-blinded study design. Propolis samples were collected from 13 different regions of the Peruvian Andes. The disk diffusion method was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test. The cytotoxic effect of propolis on human gingival fibroblasts was determined by cell viability method using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the effect of propolis on the biofilm was evaluated by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 0.78 mg/mL and 1.563 mg/mL concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the chloroform residue of Oxapampa propolis showed effects on biofilm thickness and the copy numbers of the srtA gene of S. gordonii and the radD gene of F. nucleatum at 48 and 120 hours, and chromatography (UV, λ 280 nm) identified rhamnocitrin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, kaempferol, diosmetin, acacetin, glycerol, and chrysoeriol. Conclusions: Of the 13 propolis evaluated, it was found that only the methanolic fraction of Oxapampa propolis showed antibacterial and antibiofilm effects without causing damage to human gingival fibroblasts. Likewise, when evaluating the chemical composition of this fraction, eight flavonoids were identified.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A computational biology approach for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors from natural essential oil compounds. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic on 11th March, 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the RCSB PDB database (PDB ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Out of 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as our top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. MD simulations disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but for experimental validation, they will require more in vivo trials.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatially distributed infection increases viral load in a computational model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melanie E. Moses, Steven Hofmeyr, Judy L. Cannon, Akil Andrews, Rebekah Gridley, Monica Hinga, Kirtus Leyba, Abigail Pribisova, Vanessa Surjadidjaja, Humayra Tasnim, Stephanie Forrest</p>

A key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes vary dramatically across individuals. Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo, we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus (SIMCoV), a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells, including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells. SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads. The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence, oscillations, and control. By incorporating spatial interactions, SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response. When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented, we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells, but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed differential equation model. These results illustrate how realistic, spatially explicit computational models can improve understanding of within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A data-informed mean-field approach to mapping of cortical parameter landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhuo-Cheng Xiao, Kevin K. Lin, Lai-Sang Young</p>

Constraining the many biological parameters that govern cortical dynamics is computationally and conceptually difficult because of the curse of dimensionality. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing (1) a novel data-informed mean-field (MF) approach to efficiently map the parameter space of network models; and (2) an organizing principle for studying parameter space that enables the extraction biologically meaningful relations from this high-dimensional data. We illustrate these ideas using a large-scale network model of the <i>Macaque</i> primary visual cortex. Of the 10-20 model parameters, we identify 7 that are especially poorly constrained, and use the MF algorithm in (1) to discover the firing rate contours in this 7D parameter cube. Defining a “biologically plausible” region to consist of parameters that exhibit spontaneous Excitatory and Inhibitory firing rates compatible with experimental values, we find that this region is a slightly thickened codimension-1 submanifold. An implication of this finding is that while plausible regimes depend sensitively on parameters, they are also robust and flexible provided one compensates appropriately when parameters are varied. Our organizing principle for conceptualizing parameter dependence is to focus on certain 2D parameter planes that govern lateral inhibition: Intersecting these planes with the biologically plausible region leads to very simple geometric structures which, when suitably scaled, have a universal character independent of where the intersections are taken. In addition to elucidating the geometry of the plausible region, this invariance suggests useful approximate scaling relations. Our study offers, for the first time, a complete characterization of the set of all biologically plausible parameters for a detailed cortical model, which has been out of reach due to the high dimensionality of parameter space.

                <p>by Deus Thindwa, Nicole Wolter, Amy Pinsent, Maimuna Carrim, John Ojal, Stefano Tempia, Jocelyn Moyes, Meredith McMorrow, Jackie Kleynhans, Anne von Gottberg, Neil French, PHIRST group , Cheryl Cohen, Stefan Flasche</p>

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults are at a higher risk of pneumococcal colonisation and disease, even while receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). To help evaluate potential indirect effects of vaccination of HIV-infected adults, we assessed whether HIV-infected adults disproportionately contribute to household transmission of pneumococci. We constructed a hidden Markov model to capture the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage acquisition and clearance observed during a longitudinal household-based nasopharyngeal swabbing study, while accounting for sample misclassifications. Households were followed-up twice weekly for approximately 10 months each year during a three-year study period for nasopharyngeal carriage detection via real-time PCR. We estimated the effect of participant’s age, HIV status, presence of a HIV-infected adult within the household and other covariates on pneumococcal acquisition and clearance probabilities. Of 1,684 individuals enrolled, 279 (16.6%) were younger children (<5 years-old) of whom 4 (1.5%) were HIV-infected and 726 (43.1%) were adults (≥18 years-old) of whom 214 (30.4%) were HIV-infected, most (173, 81.2%) with high CD4+ count. The observed range of pneumococcal carriage prevalence across visits was substantially higher in younger children (56.9–80.5%) than older children (5–17 years-old) (31.7–50.0%) or adults (11.5–23.5%). We estimate that 14.4% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 13.7–15.0) of pneumococcal-negative swabs were false negatives. Daily carriage acquisition probabilities among HIV-uninfected younger children were similar in households with and without HIV-infected adults (hazard ratio: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.91–1.01). Longer average carriage duration (11.4 days, 95%CI: 10.2–12.8 vs 6.0 days, 95%CI: 5.6–6.3) and higher median carriage density (622 genome equivalents per millilitre, 95%CI: 507–714 vs 389, 95%CI: 311.1–435.5) were estimated in HIV-infected vs HIV-uninfected adults. The use of ART and antibiotics substantially reduced carriage duration in all age groups, and acquisition rates increased with household size. Although South African HIV-infected adults on ART have longer carriage duration and density than their HIV-uninfected counterparts, they show similar patterns of pneumococcal acquisition and onward transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Numerical approaches for the rapid analysis of prophylactic efficacy against HIV with arbitrary drug-dosing schemes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lanxin Zhang, Junyu Wang, Max von Kleist</p>

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important pillar to prevent HIV transmission. Because of experimental and clinical shortcomings, mathematical models that integrate pharmacological, viral- and host factors are frequently used to quantify clinical efficacy of PrEP. Stochastic simulations of these models provides sample statistics from which the clinical efficacy is approximated. However, many stochastic simulations are needed to reduce the associated sampling error. To remedy the shortcomings of stochastic simulation, we developed a numerical method that allows predicting the efficacy of arbitrary prophylactic regimen directly from a viral dynamics model, without sampling. We apply the method to various hypothetical dolutegravir (DTG) prophylaxis scenarios. The approach is verified against state-of-the-art stochastic simulation. While the method is more accurate than stochastic simulation, it is superior in terms of computational performance. For example, a continuous 6-month prophylactic profile is computed within a few seconds on a laptop computer. The method’s computational performance, therefore, substantially expands the horizon of feasible analysis in the context of PrEP, and possibly other applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Meiotic Cas9 expression mediates gene conversion in the male and female mouse germline</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander J. Weitzel, Hannah A. Grunwald, Ceri Weber, Rimma Levina, Valentino M. Gantz, Stephen M. Hedrick, Ethan Bier, Kimberly L. Cooper</p>

Highly efficient gene conversion systems have the potential to facilitate the study of complex genetic traits using laboratory mice and, if implemented as a “gene drive,” to limit loss of biodiversity and disease transmission caused by wild rodent populations. We previously showed that such a system of gene conversion from heterozygous to homozygous after a sequence targeted CRISPR/Cas9 double-strand DNA break (DSB) is feasible in the female mouse germline. In the male germline, however, all DSBs were instead repaired by end joining (EJ) mechanisms to form an “insertion/deletion” (indel) mutation. These observations suggested that timing Cas9 expression to coincide with meiosis I is critical to favor conditions when homologous chromosomes are aligned and interchromosomal homology-directed repair (HDR) mechanisms predominate. Here, using a Cas9 knock-in allele at the <i>Spo11</i> locus, we show that meiotic expression of Cas9 does indeed mediate gene conversion in the male as well as in the female germline. However, the low frequency of both HDR and indel mutation in both male and female germlines suggests that Cas9 may be expressed from the <i>Spo11</i> locus at levels too low for efficient DSB formation. We suggest that more robust Cas9 expression initiated during early meiosis I may improve the efficiency of gene conversion and further increase the rate of “super-mendelian” inheritance from both male and female mice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Likely community transmission of COVID-19 infections between neighboring, persistent hotspots in Ontario, Canada [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: This study aimed to produce community-level geo-spatial mapping of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario Canada in near real-time to support decision-making. This was accomplished by area-to-area geostatistical analysis, space-time integration, and spatial interpolation of COVID-19 positive individuals. Methods: COVID-19 cases and locations were curated for geostatistical analyses from March 2020 through June 2021, corresponding to the first, second, and third waves of infections. Daily cases were aggregated according to designated forward sortation area (FSA), and postal codes (PC) in municipal regions Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo, London, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor/Essex county. Hotspots were identified with area-to-area tests including Getis-Ord Gi*, Global Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, and Local Moran’s I asymmetric clustering and outlier analyses. Case counts were also interpolated across geographic regions by Empirical Bayesian Kriging, which localizes high concentrations of COVID-19 positive tests, independent of FSA or PC boundaries. The Geostatistical Disease Epidemiology Toolbox, which is freely-available software, automates the identification of these regions and produces digital maps for public health professionals to assist in pandemic management of contact tracing and distribution of other resources.  Results: This study provided indicators in real-time of likely, community-level disease transmission through innovative geospatial analyses of COVID-19 incidence data. Municipal and provincial results were validated by comparisons with known outbreaks at long-term care and other high density residences and on farms. PC-level analyses revealed hotspots at higher geospatial resolution than public reports of FSAs, and often sooner. Results of different tests and kriging were compared to determine consistency among hotspot assignments. Concurrent or consecutive hotspots in close proximity suggested potential community transmission of COVID-19 from cluster and outlier analysis of neighboring PCs and by kriging. Results were also stratified by population based-categories (sex, age, and presence/absence of comorbidities). Conclusions: Earlier recognition of hotspots could reduce public health burdens of COVID-19 and expedite contact tracing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">5G Millimeter-Wave Beamforming System using Substrate Integrated Waveguide [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Beamforming is a key element of 5G that uses advanced antenna technologies to focus a wireless signal to a defined direction. Butler Matrix (BM) as a beamforming network is used to control the beam direction by utilizing the amplitude and the output phase. A particular technique for designing BM is through substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), which is used to realize the bilateral edge wall vias where the waveguide mode propagates through to support the current flow and reduce the loss of surface wave. Unlike conventional BM, the proposed design requires only hybrid couplers and phase shifter without any crossover. In this BM structure, the SIW hybrid coupler is designed, with two phase shifters of -90°, and one phase shifter of -180° to control the amplitude and phase shifting. This results in an optimized transmission amplitude and output phase difference. The BM also circumvents any crossover, to provide minimal losses. The hybrid coupler exhibits Sii and Sij characteristics at 28 GHz, with values of -27.35 dB for return loss, -3.9 dB for insertion loss, -3.2 dB for coupling, and -26.54 dB for the isolation. In the BM design, high transmission efficiency is observed where the return loss is less than -10 dB, while minimal transmission amplitudes are obtained within the values of ‒6 ± 3 dB. The three-port BM is designed using SIW with minimal loss and the phase difference at each respective output port of the BM shows values of 0°, -120°, and 120°. The three consecutive beams with the gains of 11.1 dBi for port 1 excitation, 9.06 dBi for port 2 excitation and 10.4 dBi for port 3 excitation is achieved when the antenna array is fed to the BM, and each of the radiated beams has beam angles of 0, -27 and 27 degrees.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Extent, impact, and mitigation of batch effects in tumor biomarker studies using tissue microarrays</a></h4>

              
                Tissue microarrays (TMAs) have been used in thousands of cancer biomarker studies. To what extent batch effects, measurement error in biomarker levels between slides, affects TMA-based studies has not been assessed systematically. We evaluated 20 protein biomarkers on 14 TMAs with prospectively collected tumor tissue from 1,448 primary prostate cancers. In half of the biomarkers, more than 10% of biomarker variance was attributable to between-TMA differences (range, 1-48%). We implemented different methods to mitigate batch effects (R package <i>batchtma</i>), tested in plasmode simulation. Biomarker levels were more similar between mitigation approaches compared to uncorrected values. For some biomarkers, associations with clinical features changed substantially after addressing batch effects. Batch effects and resulting bias are not an error of an individual study but an inherent feature of TMA-based protein biomarker studies. They always need to be considered during study design and addressed analytically in studies using more than one TMA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Slowly evolving dopaminergic activity modulates the moment-to-moment probability of reward-related self-timed movements</a></h4>

              
                Clues from human movement disorders have long suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a role in motor control, but how the endogenous dopaminergic system influences movement is unknown. Here we examined the relationship between dopaminergic signaling and the timing of reward-related movements in mice. Animals were trained to initiate licking after a self-timed interval following a start-timing cue; reward was delivered in response to movements initiated after a criterion time. The movement time was variable from trial-to-trial, as expected from previous studies. Surprisingly, dopaminergic signals ramped-up over seconds between the start-timing cue and the self-timed movement, with variable dynamics that predicted the movement/reward time on single trials. Steeply rising signals preceded early lick-initiation, whereas slowly rising signals preceded later initiation. Higher baseline signals also predicted earlier self-timed movements. Optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons during self-timing did not trigger immediate movements, but rather caused systematic early-shifting of movement initiation, whereas inhibition caused late-shifting, as if modulating the probability of movement. Consistent with this view, the dynamics of the endogenous dopaminergic signals quantitatively predicted the moment-by-moment probability of movement initiation on single trials. We propose that ramping dopaminergic signals, likely encoding dynamic reward expectation, can modulate the decision of when to move.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cnidarian hair cell development illuminates an ancient role for the class IV POU transcription factor in defining mechanoreceptor identity</a></h4>

              
                Although specialized mechanosensory cells are found across animal phylogeny, early evolutionary histories of mechanoreceptor development remain enigmatic. Cnidaria (e.g. sea anemones and jellyfishes) is the sister group to well-studied Bilateria (e.g. flies and vertebrates), and has two mechanosensory cell types - a lineage-specific sensory-effector known as the cnidocyte, and a classical mechanosensory neuron referred to as the hair cell. While developmental genetics of cnidocytes is increasingly understood, genes essential for cnidarian hair cell development are unknown. Here we show that the class IV POU homeodomain transcription factor (POU-IV) - an indispensable regulator of mechanosensory cell differentiation in Bilateria and cnidocyte differentiation in Cnidaria - controls hair cell development in the sea anemone cnidarian <i>Nematostella vectensis. N. vectensis </i>POU-IV is postmitotically expressed in tentacular hair cells, and is necessary for development of the apical mechanosensory apparatus, but not of neurites, in hair cells. Moreover, it binds to deeply conserved DNA recognition elements, and turns on a unique set of effector genes - including the transmembrane-receptor-encoding gene <i>polycystin 1 </i>- specifically in hair cells. Our results suggest that POU-IV directs differentiation of cnidarian hair cells and cnidocytes via distinct gene regulatory mechanisms, and support an evolutionarily ancient role for POU-IV in defining the mature state of mechanosensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of distinct fibroblast lineages and immune cells in dermal repair following UV radiation induced tissue damage</a></h4>

              
                Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a major source of skin damage, resulting in inflammation, premature ageing and cancer. While several UVR-induced changes, including extracellular matrix reorganisation and epidermal DNA damage, have been documented, the role of different fibroblast lineages and their communication with immune cells has not been explored. We show that acute and chronic UVR exposure led to selective loss of fibroblasts from the upper dermis in human and mouse skin. Lineage tracing and in vivo live imaging revealed that repair following acute UVR is predominantly mediated by papillary fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast reorganisation occurs with minimal migration. In contrast, chronic UVR exposure led to a permanent loss of papillary fibroblasts, with expansion of fibroblast membrane protrusions partially compensating for the reduction in cell number. Although UVR strongly activated Wnt-signalling in skin, stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by epidermal b-catenin stabilisation did not enhance papillary dermis repair. Acute UVR triggered an infiltrate of neutrophils and T cell subpopulations and increased pro-inflammatory prostaglandin signalling in skin. Depletion of CD4 and CD8 positive cells resulted in increased papillary fibroblast depletion, which correlated with an increase in DNA damage, pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and reduction in fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, topical COX-2 inhibition prevented fibroblast depletion and neutrophil infiltration after UVR. We conclude that loss of papillary fibroblasts is primarily induced by a deregulated inflammatory response, with infiltrating T cells supporting fibroblast survival upon UVR-induced environmental stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Addition of a carboxy terminal tail to the normally tailless gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor impairs fertility in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the primary neuropeptide controlling reproduction in vertebrates. GnRH stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis via a G protein-coupled receptor, GnRHR, in the pituitary gland. In mammals, GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Ctail) and does not exhibit homologous desensitization. This might be an evolutionary adaptation that enables LH surge generation and ovulation. To test this idea, we fused the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous murine GnRHR in a transgenic model. The LH surge was blunted, but not blocked in these mice. In contrast, they showed reductions in FSH production, ovarian follicle development, and fertility. Addition of the Ctail altered the nature of agonist-induced calcium signaling required for normal FSH production. The loss of the GnRHR Ctail during mammalian evolution is unlikely to have conferred a selective advantage by enabling the LH surge. The adaptive significance of this specialization remains to be determined.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Acetyl-CoA production by specific metabolites promotes cardiac repair after myocardial infarction via histone acetylation</a></h4>

              
                Myocardial infarction (MI) is accompanied by severe energy deprivation and extensive epigenetic changes. However, how energy metabolism and chromatin modifications are interlinked during MI and heart repair has been poorly explored. Here, we examined the effect of different carbon sources that are involved in the major metabolic pathways of acetyl-CoA synthesis on myocardial infarction and found that elevation of acetyl-CoA by sodium octanoate (8C) significantly improved heart function in ischemia reperfusion (I/R) rats. Mechanistically, 8C reduced I/R injury by promoting histone acetylation which in turn activated the expression of antioxidant genes and inhibited cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. Furthermore, we elucidated that 8C-promoted histone acetylation and heart repair were carried out by metabolic enzyme medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and histone acetyltransferase Kat2a, suggesting that 8C dramatically improves cardiac function mainly through metabolic acetyl-CoA-mediated histone acetylation. Therefore, our study uncovers an interlinked metabolic/epigenetic network comprising 8C, acetyl-CoA, MCAD, and Kat2a to combat heart injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distributed coding of duration in rodent prefrontal cortex during time reproduction</a></h4>

              
                As we interact with the external world, we judge magnitudes from sensory information. The estimation of magnitudes has been characterized in primates, yet it is largely unexplored in non-primate species. Here we use time interval reproduction to study rodent behavior and its neural correlates in the context of magnitude estimation. We show that gerbils display primate-like magnitude estimation characteristics in time reproduction. Most prominently their behavioral responses show a systematic overestimation of small stimuli and an underestimation of large stimuli, often referred to as regression effect. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms by recording from medial prefrontal cortex and show that the majority of neurons respond either during the measurement or the reproduction of a time interval. Cells that are active during both phases display distinct response patterns. We categorize the neural responses into multiple types and demonstrate that only populations with mixed responses can encode the bias of the regression effect. These results help unveil the organizing neural principles of time reproduction and perhaps magnitude estimation in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Crosstalk with keratinocytes causes GNAQ oncogene specificity in melanoma</a></h4>

              
                Different melanoma subtypes exhibit specific and non-overlapping sets of oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations, despite a common cell of origin in melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gα<sub>q/11 </sub>signaling pathway is a characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, uveal tract or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the epidermis. The mechanism for this specificity is unknown. Here, we present evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene. We found that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>, in combination with signaling from the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), stimulates dendrite extension, leads to actin cytoskeleton disorganization, inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in melanocytes. The effect was reversible and paracrine. In contrast,  the epidermal environment increased the survival of wildtype and Braf<sup>V600E</sup> expressing melanocytes. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of Ga<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, the identification of the epidermal signals that restrain the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene could suggest novel therapies for <i>GNAQ</i> and <i>GNA11</i> mutant melanomas.

                HAP2 is a transmembrane gamete fusogen found in multiple eukaryotic kingdoms and is structurally homologous to viral class II fusogens. Studies in <i>Plasmodium</i> have suggested that HAP2 is an attractive target for vaccines that block transmission of malaria. HAP2 has three extracellular domains, arranged in the order D2, D1, and D3. Here, we report monoclonal antibodies against the D3 fragment of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> HAP2 and crystal structures of D3 in complex with Fab fragments of two of these antibodies, one of which blocks fertilization of <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> in vitro and transmission of malaria in mosquitoes. We also show how this Fab binds the complete HAP2 ectodomain with electron microscopy. The two antibodies cross-react with HAP2 among multiple plasmodial species. Our characterization of the <i>Plasmodium</i> D3 structure, HAP2 ectodomain architecture, and mechanism of inhibition provide insights for the development of a vaccine to block malaria transmission.

                The Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) cycle is arguably the most critical metabolic cycle in physiology and exists as an essential interface coordinating cellular metabolism, bioenergetics, and redox homeostasis. Despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the consequences of TCA cycle dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we targeted two TCA cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and combined metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses to fully appraise the consequences of TCA cycle inhibition (TCAi) in murine kidney epithelial cells. Our comparative approach shows that TCAi elicits a convergent rewiring of redox and amino acid metabolism dependent on the activation of ATF4 and the integrated stress response (ISR). Furthermore, we also uncover a divergent metabolic response, whereby acute FHi, but not SDHi, can maintain asparagine levels via reductive carboxylation and maintenance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis. Our work highlights an important interplay between the TCA cycle, redox biology and amino acid homeostasis.

                Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must ensure adequate blood cell production following distinct external stressors. A comprehensive understanding of in vivo heterogeneity and specificity of HSC responses to external stimuli is currently lacking. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on functionally validated mouse HSCs and LSK (Lin-, c-Kit+, Sca1+) progenitors after in vivo pharmacological perturbation of niche signals interferon, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and prostaglandin. We identified six HSC states that are characterized by enrichment but not exclusive expression of marker genes. External signals induced rapid transitions between HSC states but transcriptional response varied both between external stimulants and within the HSC population for a given perturbation. In contrast to LSK progenitors, HSCs were characterized by a greater link between molecular signatures at baseline and in response to external stressors. Chromatin analysis of unperturbed HSCs and LSKs by scATAC-Seq suggested some HSC-specific, cell intrinsic predispositions to niche signals. We compiled a comprehensive resource of HSC- and LSK progenitor-specific chromatin and transcriptional features that represent determinants of signal receptiveness and regenerative potential during stress hematopoiesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammasome activation leads to cDC1-independent cross-priming of CD8 T cells by epithelial cell derived antigen</a></h4>

              
                The innate immune system detects pathogens and initiates adaptive immune responses. Inflammasomes are central components of the innate immune system, but whether inflammasomes provide sufficient signals to activate adaptive immunity is unclear. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), inflammasomes activate a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis, leading to epithelial cell expulsion and the release of cytokines. Here we employed a genetic system to show that simultaneous antigen expression and inflammasome activation specifically in IECs is sufficient to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. By genetic elimination of direct T cell priming by IECs, we found that IEC-derived antigens are cross-presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, cross-presentation of IEC-derived antigen to CD8+ T cells only partially depended on IEC pyroptosis. In the absence of inflammasome activation, cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required <i>Batf3</i><sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (cDC1), whereas cross-priming in the presence of pyroptosis required a <i>Zbtb26</i><sup>+</sup> but <i>Batf3</i>-independent cDC population. These data suggest the existence of parallel pyroptosis-dependent and pyroptosis-independent pathways for cross-presentation of IEC-derived antigens.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">FMRP regulates mRNAs encoding distinct functions in the cell body and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on translation of synaptic mRNAs in order to generate activity-dependent changes in plasticity. Here we develop a strategy combining compartment-specific CLIP and TRAP in conditionally tagged mice to precisely define the ribosome-bound dendritic transcriptome of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We identify CA1 dendritic transcripts with differentially localized mRNA isoforms generated by alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing, including many which have altered protein-coding capacity. Among dendritic mRNAs, FMRP targets were found to be overrepresented. Cell-type specific FMRP-CLIP and TRAP in microdissected CA1 neuropil revealed 383 dendritic FMRP targets and suggests that FMRP differentially regulates functionally distinct modules in CA1 dendrites and cell bodies. FMRP regulates ~15-20% of mRNAs encoding synaptic functions and 10% of chromatin modulators, in the dendrite and cell body, respectively. In the absence of FMRP, dendritic FMRP targets had increased ribosome association, consistent with a function for FMRP in synaptic translational repression. Conversely, downregulation of FMRP targets involved in chromatin regulation in cell bodies and suggest a role for FMRP in stabilizing mRNAs containing stalled ribosomes in this compartment. Together, the data support a model in which FMRP regulates the translation and expression of synaptic and nuclear proteins within different compartments of a single neuronal cell type.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurons burdened by DNA double strand breaks incite microglia activation through antiviral-like signaling in neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are linked to aging, neurodegeneration, and senescence. However, the role played by neurons burdened with DSBs in disease-associated neuroinflammation is not well understood. Here, we isolate neurons harboring DSBs from the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration through fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS), and characterize their transcriptomes using single-nucleus, bulk, and spatial sequencing techniques. We find that neurons harboring DSBs enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by the activation of senescent and antiviral-like immune pathways. We identify the NFkB transcription factor as a master regulator of immune gene expression in DSB-bearing neurons, and find that the expression of cytokines like Cxcl10 and Ccl2 develop in DSB-bearing neurons before glial cell types. Alzheimers Disease pathology is significantly associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons, and direct purification of DSB-bearing neurons from Alzheimers Disease brain tissue further validates immune gene upregulation. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons also harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFkB knock down in neurons. Inhibition of NFkB or depletion of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglial activation in organotypic brain slice culture. In conclusion, we find that in the context of age-associated neurodegenerative disease, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation. These findings highlight a novel role for neurons in the mechanism of age-associated neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying the inverted U: A meta-analysis of prefrontal dopamine, D1-receptors, and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex can be disrupted in human disorders that affect cognitive function such as Parkinson's disease (PD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Dopamine has a powerful effect on prefrontal circuits via the D1-type dopamine receptor (D1DR). It has been proposed that prefrontal dopamine has "inverted U-shaped" dynamics, with optimal dopamine and D1DR signaling required for optimal cognitive function. However, the quantitative relationship between prefrontal dopamine and cognitive function is not clear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of published manipulations of prefrontal dopamine and the effects on working memory, a high-level executive function in humans, primates, and rodents that involves maintaining and manipulating information over seconds to minutes. We reviewed 646 papers and found that 75 studies met criteria for inclusion. Our quantification of effect sizes for dopamine, D1DRs, and behavior revealed a negative quadratic slope. This is consistent with the proposed inverted U-shape of prefrontal dopamine and D1DRs and working memory performance, explaining 10% of the variance. Of note, the inverted quadratic fit was much stronger for prefrontal D1DRs alone, explaining 26% of the variance, compared to prefrontal dopamine alone, explaining 10% of the variance. Taken together, these data, derived from a variety of manipulations and systems, demonstrate that optimal prefrontal dopamine signalling is linked with higher cognitive function. Our results provide insight into the fundamental dynamics of prefrontal dopamine, which could be useful for pharmacological interventions targeting prefrontal dopaminergic circuits, and into the pathophysiology of human brain disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in vivo, neuron-specific approach for pairing translational and epigenetic signatures of early-life exercise</a></h4>

              
                Aerobic exercise promotes physiological and molecular adaptations in neurons to influence brain function and behavior. The most well studied neurobiological consequences of exercise are those which underlie exercise-induced improvements in hippocampal memory, including the expression and regulation of the neurotrophic factor Bdnf. Whether aerobic exercise taking place during early-life periods of postnatal brain maturation has similar impacts on gene expression and its regulation remains to be investigated. Using unbiased next-generation sequencing we characterize gene expression programs and their regulation by specific, memory-associated histone modifications during juvenile-adolescent voluntary exercise (ELE). Traditional transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing approaches have either used heterogeneous cell populations from whole tissue homogenates or flow cytometry for single cell isolation to distinguish cell types / subtypes. These methods fall short in providing cell-type specificity without compromising sequencing depth or procedure-induced changes to cellular phenotype. In this study, we use simultaneous isolation of translating mRNA and nuclear chromatin from a neuron-enriched cell population to more accurately pair ELE-induced changes in gene expression with epigenetic modifications. We employ a line of transgenic mice expressing the NuTRAP (Nuclear Tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) cassette under the Emx1 promoter allowing for brain cell-type specificity. We then developed a technique that combines nuclear isolation using Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in Specific Cell Types (INTACT) with Translating Ribosomal Affinity Purification (TRAP) methods to determine cell type-specific epigenetic modifications influencing gene expression programs from a population of Emx1 expressing hippocampal neurons. Data from RNA-seq and CUT&RUN-seq were coupled to evaluate histone modifications influencing the expression of translating mRNA in neurons after early-life exercise (ELE). We also performed separate INTACT and TRAP isolations for validation of our protocol and demonstrate similar molecular functions and biological processes implicated by gene ontology (GO) analysis. Finally, as prior studies use tissue from opposite brain hemispheres to pair transcriptomic and epigenomic data from the same rodent, we take a bioinformatics approach to compare hemispheric differences in gene expression programs and histone modifications altered by by ELE. Our data reveal transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of ELE exposure and identify novel candidate gene-histone modification interactions for further investigation. Importantly, our novel approach of combined INTACT/TRAP methods from the same cell suspension allows for simultaneous transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing in a cell-type specific manner.

                The ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) describes the persistent shift of perceived sound location after having been adapted to a ventriloquism condition, in which the sound was repeatedly paired with a displaced visual stimulus. In the latter case, participants consistently mislocalize the sound in the direction of the visual stimulus (ventriloquism effect, VE). Previous studies provide conflicting reports regarding the strength of the VAE, ranging from 0 to nearly 100%. Moreover, there is controversy about its generalization to different sounds than the one inducing the VE, ranging from no transfer at all, to full transfer across different sound spectra. Here, we imposed the VE for three different sounds: a low-frequency and a high-frequency narrow-band noise, and a broadband Gaussian white noise (GWN). In the adaptation phase, listeners generated fast goal-directed head movements to localize the sound, presented across a 70 deg range in the horizontal plane, while ignoring a visual distracter that was consistently displaced 10 deg to the right of the sound. In the post-adaptation phase, participants localized narrow-band sounds with center frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz, as well as GWN, without the visual distracter. Our results show that the VAE amounted to approximately 40% of the VE and generalized well across the entire frequency domain. We also found that the strength of the VAE correlated with the pre-adaptation sound-localization performance. We compare our results with previous reports and discuss different hypotheses regarding optimal audio-visual cue integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning enhances encoding of time and temporal surprise in primary sensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Primary sensory cortex has long been believed to play a straightforward role in the initial processing of sensory information. Yet, the superficial layers of cortex overall are sparsely active, even during sensory stimulation; moreover, cortical activity is influenced by other modalities, task context, reward, and behavioral state. Our study demonstrates that reinforcement learning dramatically alters representations among longitudinally imaged neurons in superficial layers of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. Learning an object detection task recruits previously unresponsive neurons, enlarging the neuronal population sensitive to touch and behavioral choice. In contrast, cortical responses decrease upon repeated exposure to unrewarded stimuli. Moreover, training improved population encoding of the passage of time, and unexpected deviations in trial timing elicited even stronger responses than touch did. In conclusion, the superficial layers of sensory cortex exhibit a high degree of learning-dependent plasticity and are strongly modulated by non-sensory but behaviorally-relevant features, such as timing and surprise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct hippocampal network states support theta phase precession and theta sequences in CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus likely uses temporal coding to represent complex memories via mechanisms such as theta phase precession and theta sequences. Theta sequences are rapid sweeps of spikes from multiple place cells, encoding past or planned trajectories or non-spatial information. Phase precession, the correlation between a place cell's theta firing phase and animal position has been suggested to facilitate sequence emergence. We find that CA1 phase precession varies strongly across cells and environmental contingencies. Phase precession depends on the CA1 network state, and is only present when the medium gamma oscillation (60-90 Hz, linked to Entorhinal inputs) dominates. Conversely, theta sequences are most evident for non-precessing cells or with leading slow gamma (20-45 Hz, linked to CA3 inputs). These results challenge the view that phase precession is the mechanism underlying the emergence of theta sequences and point at a 'dual network states' model for hippocampal temporal code, potentially supporting merging of memory and exogenous information in CA1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subject-specific features of excitation/inhibition profiles in neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Brain pathologies are based on microscopic changes in neurons and synapses that reverberate into large scale networks altering brain dynamics and functional states. An important yet unresolved issue concerns the impact of patients excitation/inhibition profiles on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In this work we used a simulation platform, The Virtual Brain, to simulate brain dynamics in healthy controls and in Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. The brain connectome and functional connectivity were extracted from 3T-MRI scans and The Virtual Brain nodes were represented by a Wong-Wang neural mass model endowing an explicit representation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. The integration of cerebro-cerebellar loops improved the correlation between experimental and simulated functional connectivity, and hence The Virtual Brain predictive power, in all pathological conditions. The Virtual Brain biophysical parameters differed between clinical phenotypes, predicting higher global coupling and inhibition in Alzheimer's disease and stronger NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent excitation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. These physio-pathological parameters allowed an advanced analysis of patients' state. In backward regressions, The Virtual Brain parameters significantly contributed to explain the variation of neuropsychological scores and, in discriminant analysis, the combination of The Virtual Brain parameters and neuropsychological scores significantly improved discriminative power between clinical conditions. Eventually, cluster analysis provided a unique description of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in individual patients. In aggregate, The Virtual Brain simulations reveal differences in the excitatory/inhibitory balance of individual patients that, combined with cognitive assessment, can promote the personalized diagnosis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crosstalk between biochemical signaling and trafficking determines AMPAR dynamics in synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity involves the modification of both biochemical and structural components of neurons. Many studies have revealed that the change in the number density of the glutamatergic receptor AMPAR at the synapse is proportional to synaptic weight update; increase in AMPAR corresponds to strengthening of synapses while decrease in AMPAR density weakens synaptic connections. The dynamics of AMPAR are thought to be regulated by upstream signaling, primarily the calcium-CaMKII pathway, trafficking to and from the synapse, and influx from extrasynaptic sources. Here, we have developed a set of models using compartmental ordinary differential equations to systematically investigate contributions of signaling and trafficking variations on AMPAR dynamics at the synaptic site. We find that the model properties including network architecture and parameters significantly affect the integration of fast upstream species by slower downstream species. Furthermore, we predict that the model outcome, as determined by bound AMPAR at the synaptic site, depends on (a) the choice of signaling model (bistable CaMKII or monostable CaMKII dynamics), (b) trafficking versus influx contributions, and (c) frequency of stimulus. Therefore, AMPAR dynamics can have unexpected dependencies when upstream signaling dynamics (such as CaMKII and PP1) are coupled with trafficking modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying control ensembles for decision-making within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit</a></h4>

              
                During action selection, mammals exhibit a high degree of flexibility in adapting their decisions in response to environmental changes. Although the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) network is implicated in this adaptation, it features a synaptic architecture comprising multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, complicating efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process of evidence accumulation during decision-making. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to parameters of a normative drift diffusion model (DDM) representing algorithmic aspects of information accumulation during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles impacting specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide key mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in shifting different aspects of decision policies.

                In this study we explore the interference rejection and spatial sampling properties of multi-axis Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) data. We use both vector spherical harmonics and eigenspectra to quantify how well an array can separate neuronal signal from environmental interference while adequately sampling the entire cortex. We found that triaxial OPMs have superb noise rejection properties allowing for very high orders of interference (L=6) to be accounted for while minimally affecting the neural space (2dB attenuation for a 60-sensor triaxial system). To adequately model the signals arising from the cortex, we show that at least 11th order (143 spatial degrees of freedom) irregular solid harmonics or 95 eigenvectors of the lead field are needed to model the neural space for OPM data (regardless of number of axes measured). This can be adequately sampled with 75-100 equidistant triaxial sensors (225-300 channels) or 200 equidistant radial channels. In other words, ordering the same number of channels in triaxial (rather than purely radial) configuration gives significant advantages not only in terms of external noise rejection but also minimizes cost, weight and cross-talk.

                Oscillatory activity is thought to coordinate neural computations across brain regions, and theta oscillations are critical for learning and memory. Because the frequency of respiratory-related oscillations (RROs) in rodents can overlap with the frequency of theta in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus, we asked whether odor-cued working memory may be supported by coupling between these two oscillations. We first confirmed that RROs are propagated to the hippocampus and PFC and that RRO frequency overlaps with canonical theta frequency. However, we found low coherence between RROs and local theta oscillations in the hippocampus-PFC network when the two types of oscillations overlapped in frequency. This effect was observed during all behavioral phases including during movement and while odors were actively sampled when stationary. Despite the similarity in frequency, RROs and theta oscillations therefore appear to be limited to supporting computation in distinct networks, which suggests that sustained long-range coordination between oscillation patterns that depend on separate pacemakers is not necessary to support at least one type of working memory.

                The present study proposes a novel concept of neuroadaptive technology, namely a dual passive-reactive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), that enables bi-directional interaction between humans and machines. We have implemented such a system in a realistic flight simulator using the NextMind classification algorithms and framework to decode pilots' intention (reactive BCI) and to infer their level of attention (passive BCI). Twelve pilots used the reactive BCI to perform checklists along with an anti-collision radar monitoring task that was supervised by the passive BCI. The latter simulated an automatic avoidance maneuver when it detected that pilots missed an incoming collision. The reactive BCI reached 100% classification accuracy with a mean reaction time of 1.6s when exclusively performing the checklist task. Accuracy was up to 98.5% with a mean reaction time of 2.5s when pilots also had to fly the aircraft and monitor the anti-collision radar. The passive BCI achieved a F1 score of 0.94. This first demonstration shows the potential of a dual BCI to improve human-machine teaming which could be applied to a variety of applications.

Many studies have reported that subjects slow down following an error, a phenomenon called "post-error slowing" (PES). However, the functional significance of PES is still a matter of debate as it is not always adaptive. That is, it is not always associated with a gain in performance and can even occur with a decline in accuracy. Here, we hypothesized that the nature of PES is influenced by one's speed-accuracy tradeoff policy, which determines the overall level of choice accuracy in the task at hand. To test this hypothesis, we investigated post-error adjustments in subjects performing the same task while they were required to either emphasize speed (low accuracy) or cautiousness (high accuracy) in two distinct contexts (hasty and cautious contexts, respectively) experienced on separate days. Accordingly, our data indicate that post-error adjustments varied according to the context in which subjects performed the task, with PES being solely significant in the hasty context. In addition, we only observed a gain in performance after errors in a specific trial type, suggesting that post-error adjustments depend on a complex combination of processes that affect the speed of ensuing actions as well as the degree to which such PES comes with a gain in performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal lesion network mapping to predict sensorimotor behavior in stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                Lesion network mapping (LNM) has proved to be a successful technique to map symptoms to brain networks after acquired brain injury. Beyond the characteristics of a lesion, such as its etiology, size or location, LNM has shown that common symptoms in patients after injury may reflect the effects of their lesions on the same circuits, thereby linking symptoms to specific brain networks. Here, we extend LNM to its multimodal form, using a combination of functional and structural connectivity maps drawn from data from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We applied the multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Test scores were predicted using a Canonical Correlation Analysis with multimodal brain maps as independent variables, and cross-validation strategies were employed to overcome overfitting. The results obtained led us to draw three conclusions. First, the multimodal analysis reveals how functional connectivity maps contribute more than structural connectivity maps in the optimal prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, the maximal association solution between the behavioral outcome and multimodal lesion connectivity maps suggests an equal contribution of sensory and motor coefficients, in contrast to the unimodal analyses where the sensory contribution dominates in both structural and functional maps. Finally, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural connectivity maps strongly depends on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect of larger lesions that produce more severe sensorimotor dysfunction. By contrast, the maps of functional connectivity performed similarly irrespective of any correction for lesion size. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of imaging modalities, and the influence of their corresponding brain networks on behavioral performance after acquired brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Remote contextual fear retrieval engages activity from salience network regions in rats</a></h4>

              
                The ability to retrieve contextual fear memories depends on the coordinated activation of a brain-wide circuitry. Transition from recent to remote memories seems to involve the reorganization of this circuitry, a process called systems consolidation that has been associated with time-dependent fear generalization. However, it is not known whether emotional memories acquired under different levels of stress can undergo different systems consolidation processes. Here, we explored the activation pattern and functional connectivity of key brain regions associated with contextual fear conditioning (CFC) retrieval after recent (2 days) or remote (28 days) memory tests performed in rats submitted to strong (1.0mA footshock) or mild (0.3mA footshock) training. We used brain tissue from Wistar rats from a previous study, where we observed that increasing training intensity promotes fear memory generalization over time, possibly due to an increase in corticosterone levels during memory consolidation. Analysis of Fos expression across 8 regions of interest (ROIs) allowed us to identify coactivation between them at both timepoints following memory recall. Our results showed that strong CFC elicits higher Fos activation in the anterior insular and prelimbic cortices during remote retrieval, which was - along with the basolateral amygdala - positively correlated with freezing. Rats trained either with mild or strong CFC showed a broad functional connectivity at the recent timepoint whereas only animals submitted to the strong CFC showed a widespread loss of coactivation during remote retrieval. Our findings suggest that increasing training intensity results in differential processes of systems consolidation, possibly associated with increased post-training corticosterone release, and that strong CFC engages activity from areas associated with the salience network during remote retrieval.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Correlation of receptor density and mRNA expression patterns in the human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Changes in distribution of associated molecular targets have been reported across several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the high-resolution topology of most proteins is unknown and simultaneous in vivo measurement in multi-receptor systems is complicated. To account for the missing proteomic information, mRNA transcripts are typically used as a surrogate. Nonetheless, post-transcriptional and post-translational processes might cause the discrepancy between the final distribution of proteins and gene expression patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate ex vivo links between mRNA expression and corresponding receptor density in the human cerebral cortex. To this end, autoradiography data on the density of 15 different receptors in 38 brain regions were correlated with the expression patterns of 50 associated genes derived from microarray data (mA), RNA sequencing data (RNA-Seq) provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas and predicted mRNA expression patterns (pred-mRNA). Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the possible links between proteomic data and mRNA expression patterns. Correlations between mRNA and protein density varied greatly between targets: Positive associations were found for e.g. the serotonin 1A (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.708; mA: rs = 0.601) or kainate receptor (pred-mRNA: rs = 0.655; mA: rs = 0.601; RNA-Seq: rs = 0.575), while most of the investigated target receptors showed low or negative correlations. The high variability in the correspondence of mRNA expression and receptor warrants caution when inferring the topology of molecular targets in the brain from transcriptome data. This highlights the longstanding value of molecular imaging data and the need for comprehensive proteomic data.

                Acute stress triggers plasticity of forebrain synapses as well as behavioral changes. Here we reveal that Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF) is a required downstream mediator of the stress response in mice, necessary for stress-induced synaptic potentiation in the ventral hippocampus and for an increase in anxiety-like behaviour. Acute stress is sufficient to activate microglia, triggering the long-term release TNF. Critically, on-going TNF signaling in the ventral hippocampus is necessary to sustain both the stress-induced synaptic and behavioral changes, as these could be reversed hours after induction by antagonizing TNF signaling. This demonstrates that TNF maintains the synaptic and behavioral stress response in vivo, making TNF a potential novel therapeutic target for stress disorders.

                Microglia are critical for brain development and play a central role in Alzheimers disease (AD) etiology. Down syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21, is the most common genetic origin of intellectual disability and the most common risk factor for AD. Surprisingly, little information is available on the impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglia in DS brain development and AD in DS (DSAD). Using our new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based human microglia-containing cerebral organoid and chimeric mouse brain models, here we report that DS microglia exhibit enhanced synaptic pruning function during brain development. Consequently, electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that DS microglial mouse chimeras show impaired synaptic neurotransmission, as compared to control microglial chimeras. Upon being exposed to human brain tissue-derived soluble pathological tau, DS microglia display dystrophic phenotypes in chimeric mouse brains, recapitulating microglial responses seen in human AD and DSAD brain tissues. Further flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and immunohistological analyses of chimeric mouse brains demonstrate that DS microglia undergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type I interferon signaling after being challenged by pathological tau. Mechanistically, we find that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsa21encoded type I interferon receptor genes, IFNARs, rescues the defective DS microglial phenotypes both during brain development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide first in vivo evidence supporting a paradigm shifting theory that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting accelerated senescence and dystrophic phenotypes. Our results further suggest that targeting IFNARs may improve microglial functions during DS brain development and prevent human microglial senescence in DS individuals with AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distribution of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in non-diseased brain implicates olfactory bulb mitral cells in synucleinopathy pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Synucleinopathies including Parkinsons disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intracellular accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein called Lewy pathology. Alpha-synuclein within Lewy pathology is aggregated into protease resistant filamentous structures and is predominantly phosphorylated at serine 129 (PSER129). Lewy pathology has been hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system as the disease progresses. Cross-sectional studies have shown the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract consistently bare LP for common synucleinopathies, making these structures likely starting points for the spreading process, and thus disease. Here we examined the distribution of PSER129 in non-diseased brain. To do this we used a sensitive tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique to detect low abundance endogenous PSER129 under ideal antibody binding conditions. In wild-type non-diseased mice, PSER129 was detected in the olfactory bulb and several brain regions of the olfactory cortex across the neuroaxis (i.e., olfactory bulb to brain stem). PSER129 was particularly apparent in the mitral cell layer and the outer plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb where it was observed as cytosolic/nuclear puncta or fibers, respectively. PSER129 immunoreactivity in the healthy olfactory bulb was abolished by pretreatment of the tissue with proteinase K, pre-absorption of the primary antibody against the purified PSER129 peptide fragment, or the omission of the PSER129 antibody. Furthermore, PSER129 immunoreactivity was not observed in any brain region of alpha-synuclein knockout mice. Dual labeling for the PSER129 and the mitral cell marker TBX21 showed that PSER129 positive structures of the healthy OB were found in mitral cells. We found evidence of the same PSER129 positive structures in the olfactory bulb of non-diseased rats, non-human primates, healthy humans, but not individuals diagnosed with PD. Results suggest biological pathways responsible for alpha-synuclein phosphorylation are constitutively active in OB mitral cells and alpha-synuclein in these cells may be predisposed to pathological aggregation. Pathological seeds originating in mitral cells may act as a source for alpha-synuclein spread competent assemblies that spreads throughout the brain via fibers of the olfactory tract. Future studies should investigate the normal function of alpha-synuclein in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, which may give insight into synucleinopathy disease origins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ensemble of toxic channel types underlies the severity of the de novo variant G375R of the human BK channel</a></h4>

              
                De novo mutations play a prominent role in neurodevelopmental diseases including autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Many de novo mutations are dominant and so severe that the afflicted individuals do not reproduce, so the mutations are not passed into the general population. For multimeric proteins, such severity may result from a dominant-negative effect where mutant subunits assemble with WT to produce channels with adverse properties. Here we study the de novo variant G375R heterozygous with the WT allele for the large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated potassium (BK) channel, Slo1. This variant has been reported to produce devastating neurodevelopmental disorders in three unrelated children. If mutant and WT subunits assemble randomly to form tetrameric BK channels, then ~6% of the assembled channels would be wild type (WT), ~88% would be heteromeric incorporating from 1-3 mutant subunits per channel, and ~6% would be homomeric mutant channels consisting of four mutant subunits. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the biophysical properties of single BK channels in the ensemble of channels expressed following a 1:1 injection of mutant and WT cRNA into oocytes. We found ~3% were WT channels, ~85% were heteromeric channels, and ~12% were homomeric mutant channels. All of the heteromeric channels as well as the homomeric mutant channels displayed toxic properties, indicating a dominant negative effect of the mutant subunits. The toxic channels were open at inappropriate negative voltages, even in the absence of Ca2+, which would lead to altered cellular function and decreased neuronal excitability.

                Identifying parameters of computational models that capture experimental data is a central task in cognitive neuroscience. Bayesian statistical inference aims to not only find a single configuration of best-fitting parameters, but to recover all model parameters that are consistent with the data and prior knowledge. Statistical inference methods usually require the ability to evaluate the likelihood of the model--however, for many models of interest in cognitive neuroscience, the associated likelihoods cannot be computed efficiently. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a solution to this problem by only requiring access to simulations produced by the model. Here, we provide an efficient SBI method for models of decision-making. Our approach, Mixed Neural Likelihood Estimation (MNLE), trains neural density estimators on model simulations to emulate the simulator. The likelihoods of the emulator can then be used to perform Bayesian parameter inference on experimental data using standard approximate inference methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. While most neural likelihood estimation methods target continuous data, MNLE works with mixed data types, as typically obtained in decision-making experiments (e.g., binary decisions and associated continuous reaction times). We demonstrate MNLE on the classical drift-diffusion model (DDM) and compare its performance to a recently proposed method for SBI on DDMs, called likelihood approximation networks (LAN, Fengler et al. 2021). We show that MNLE is substantially more efficient than LANs, requiring up to six orders of magnitudes fewer model simulations to achieve comparable likelihood accuracy and evaluation time while providing the same level of flexibility. We include an implementation of our algorithm in the user-friendly open source package sbi.

                Animals have been proposed to abstract compact representations of a task's structure that could, in principle, support accelerated learning and flexible behavior. Whether and how such abstracted representations may be used to assign credit for inferred, but unobserved, relationships in structured environments are unknown. Here, we develop a novel hierarchical reversal-learning task and Bayesian learning model to assess the computational and neural mechanisms underlying how humans infer specific choice-outcome associations via structured knowledge. We find that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) efficiently represents hierarchically related choice-outcome associations governed by the same latent cause, using a generalized code to assign credit for both experienced and inferred outcomes. Furthermore, mPFC and lateral orbital frontal cortex track the inferred current "position" within a latent association space that generalizes over stimuli. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance both of tracking the current position in an abstracted task space and efficient, generalizable representations in prefrontal cortex for supporting flexible learning and inference in structured environments.

                New brain atlases with high spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage have rapidly advanced our knowledge of the brain's neural architecture, including the systematic variation of excitatory and inhibitory cell densities across the mammalian cortex. But understanding how the brain's microscale physiology shapes brain dynamics at the macroscale has remained a challenge. While physiologically based mathematical models of brain dynamics are well placed to bridge this explanatory gap, their complexity can form a barrier to providing clear mechanistic interpretation of the dynamics they generate. In this work we develop a neural-mass model of the mouse cortex and show how bifurcation diagrams, which capture local dynamical responses to inputs and their variation across brain regions, can be used to understand the resulting whole-brain dynamics. We show that strong fits to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can be found in surprisingly simple dynamical regimes (including where all brain regions are confined to a stable fixed point) where regions are able to respond strongly to variations in their inputs, consistent with direct structural connections providing a strong constraint on functional connectivity in the anesthetized mouse. We also use bifurcation diagrams to show how perturbations to local excitatory and inhibitory coupling strengths across the cortex, constrained by cell-density data, provide spatially dependent constraints on resulting cortical activity, and support a greater diversity of coincident dynamical regimes. Our work illustrates methods for visualizing and interpreting model performance in terms of underlying dynamical mechanisms, an approach that is crucial for building explanatory and physiologically grounded models of the dynamical principles that underpin large-scale brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SEX-SPECIFIC TRAJECTORIES OF REELIN-DEPENDENT MATURATION OF DEEP LAYER PREFRONTAL NEURONS</a></h4>

              
                Throughout early adulthood, the anatomical and functional maturation of PFC circuitry continues under the influence of multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors, most notably electrical activity, and molecular cues. We previously showed that the extracellular matrix protein reelin orchestrates the structural and functional maturation of deep layers medial PFC (mPFC) pyramidal neurons. Additionally, we reported that reelin haploinsufficiency is associated to prefrontal disruptions of long-term memory retention thereby illustrating the eminent role of reelin in cognitive maturation of the PFC. Prefrontal maturation follows a sex-specific developmental pattern, supporting the existence of sexual differences in the morphology-functional properties PFC. Here, we interrogated the role of reelin in the functional maturation of excitatory networks in the mPFC. The developmental trajectory of reelin's expression and deep layer pyramidal neurons synaptic plasticity was tracked in the mPFC of male and female mice, from the juvenile period to adulthood. To assess the role of reelin in both sexes, wild-type and heterozygous reeler mice (HRM) were compared. The results show that the maturational profile of reelin expression in the mPFC is sex-dependent and that the developmental trajectory of long-term potentiation is different between wild-type males and females. These data demonstrate reelin influence on prefrontal synapses is sex and period specific.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of perceiving and interpreting engraved prehistoric patterns as human production: effect of archaeological expertise.</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that engraved abstract patterns dating from the Middle and Lower Palaeolithic served as means of representation and communication. Identifying the brain regions involved in visual processing of these engravings can provide insights into their function. In this study, brain activity was measured during perception of the earliest known Palaeolithic engraved patterns and compared to natural patterns mimicking human-made engravings. Participants were asked to categorise marks as being intentionally made by humans or due to natural processes (e.g. erosion, root etching). To simulate the putative familiarity of our ancestors with the marks, the responses of expert archaeologists and control participants were compared, allowing characterisation of the effect of previous knowledge on both behaviour and brain activity in perception of the marks. Besides a set of regions common to both groups and involved in visual analysis and decision-making, the experts exhibited greater activity in the inferior part of the lateral occipital cortex, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and medial thalamic regions. These results are consistent with those reported in visual expertise studies, and confirm the importance of the integrative visual areas in the perception of the earliest abstract engravings. The attribution of a natural rather than human origin to the marks elicited greater activity in the salience network in both groups, reflecting the uncertainty and ambiguity in the perception of, and decision-making for, natural patterns. The activation of the salience network might also be related to the process at work in the attribution of an intention to the marks. The primary visual area was not specifically involved in the visual processing of engravings, which argued against its central role in the emergence of engraving production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taking stock of the past: A psychometric evaluation of the Autobiographical Interview</a></h4>

              
                Autobiographical memory (AM) involves a rich phenomenological re-experiencing of a spatio-temporal event from the past, which is challenging to objectively quantify. The Autobiographical Interview (AI; Levine et al., 2002, Psychology & Aging) is a manualized performance-based assessment designed to quantify episodic (internal) and semantic (external) features of recalled and verbally conveyed prior experiences. The AI has been widely adopted yet has not undergone a comprehensive psychometric validation. We investigated the reliability, validity, association to individual differences measures, and factor structure in healthy younger and older adults (N=352). Evidence for the AI's reliability was strong: the subjective scoring protocol showed high inter-rater reliability and previously identified age effects were replicated. Internal consistency across timepoints was robust, suggesting stability in recollection. Central to our validation, internal AI scores were positively correlated with standard, performance-based measures of episodic memory, demonstrating convergent validity. The two-factor structure for the AI was not well-supported by confirmatory factor analysis. Adjusting internal and external detail scores for the number of words spoken (detail density) improved trait estimation of AM performance. Overall, the AI demonstrated sound psychometric properties for inquiry into the qualities of autobiographical remembering.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The what and where of synchronous sound perception</a></h4>

              
                Sound localization and identification are challenging in acoustically rich environments. The relation between these two processes is still poorly understood. As natural sound-sources rarely occur exactly simultaneously, we wondered whether the auditory system could identify ('what') and localize ('where') two spatially separated sounds with synchronous onsets. While listeners typically report hearing a single source at an average location, one study found that both sounds may be accurately localized if listeners are explicitly being told two sources exist. We here tested whether simultaneous source identification (one vs. two) and localization is possible, by letting listeners choose to make either one or two head-orienting saccades to the perceived location(s). Results show that listeners could identify two sounds only when presented on different sides of the head, and that identification accuracy increased with their spatial separation. Notably, listeners were unable to accurately localize either sound, irrespective of whether one or two sounds were identified. Instead, the first (or only) response always landed near the average location, while second responses were unrelated to the targets. We conclude that localization of synchronous sounds in the absence of prior information is impossible. We discuss that the putative cortical 'what' pathway may not transmit relevant information to the 'where' pathway. We examine how a broadband interaural correlation cue could help to correctly identify the presence of two sounds without being able to localize them. We propose that the persistent averaging behavior reveals that the 'where' system intrinsically assumes that synchronous sounds originate from a single source.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable roles for the striatal cholinergic system in different flexibility contexts.</a></h4>

              
                The production of behavioural flexibility requires the coordination and integration of information from across the brain, by the dorsal striatum. In particular, the striatal cholinergic system is thought to be important for the modulation of striatal activity. Research from animal literature has shown that chemical inactivation of the dorsal striatum leads to impairments in reversal learning. Furthermore, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy work has shown that the striatal cholinergic system is also important for reversal learning in humans. Here, we aim to assess whether the state of the dorsal striatal cholinergic system at rest is related to flexible behaviour in reversal learning. We provide preliminary results showing that variability in choline in the dorsal striatum is significantly related to both the number perseverative and regressive errors that participants make, and their rate of learning from positive and negative prediction errors. These findings, in line with previous work, suggest the resting state of dorsal striatal cholinergic system has important implications for producing flexible behaviour. However, these results also suggest the system may have heterogeneous functionality across different types of tasks measuring behavioural flexibility. These findings provide a starting point for further interrogation into understanding the functional role of the striatal cholinergic system in flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal fusion analysis of functional, cerebrovascular and structural neuroimaging in healthy ageing subjects</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive ageing is a complex process which requires multimodal approach. Neuroimaging can provide insights into brain morphology, functional organization and vascular dynamics. However, most neuroimaging studies of ageing have focused on each imaging modality separately, limiting the understanding of interrelations between processes identified by different modalities and the interpretation of neural correlates of cognitive decline in ageing. Here, we used linked independent component analysis as a data-driven multimodal approach to jointly analyze magnetic resonance imaging of grey matter density, cerebrovascular, and functional network topographies. Neuroimaging and behavioural data (n = 215) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience study were used, containing healthy subjects aged 18 to 88. In the output components, fusion was found between structural and cerebrovascular topographies in multiple components with cognitive-relevance across the lifespan. A component reflecting global atrophy with regional cerebrovascular changes and a component reflecting right frontoparietal network activity were correlated with fluid intelligence over and above age and gender. No meaningful fusion between functional network topography and structural or cerebrovascular signals was observed. We propose that integrating multiple neuroimaging modalities allows to better characterize brain pattern variability and to differentiate brain changes in healthy ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoid during adolescence phenocopies reelin haploinsufficiency in prefrontal cortex synapses</a></h4>

              
                In humans and rodents, the protracted development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) throughout adolescence represents a time for marked vulnerability towards environmental adversities, such as stress or drug exposure. We previously showed that the extracellular matrix protein reelin is an instrumental synaptic modulator that shapes medial PFC (mPFC) circuitry during maturation and is a critical mediator of the vulnerability to environmental stress. Emerging evidence highlight the role of the endocannabinoid system in the postnatal maturation of the PFC and reelin deficiency influences behavioral abnormalities caused by heavy consumption of THC during adolescence. Could the reelin-dependent maturation of prefrontal networks may be vulnerable to cannabinoid exposure during adolescence? To explore this hypothesis, we studied the effects of a single in-vivo exposure to a synthetic cannabinoid on reelin expression and mPFC functions in adolescent male mice. The results show that a single cannabinoid exposure mimics reelin haploinsufficiency by decreasing prefrontal reelin expression in a layer-specific pattern without changing its transcriptional levels. Furthermore, this treatment impeded synaptic plasticity: adolescent cannabinoid lowered long-term potentiation to the magnitude observed in age-matched reelin haploinsufficient males. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that changes in the mRNA levels of NMDARs does not account for the reduction of TBS-LTP. Together, the data show that exposure to cannabinoid during adolescence phenocopies reelin haploinsufficiency and further identifies reelin as a key component of the vulnerability of PFC to environmental insults.

	<p>Recoverin-antibody-related disease is currently restricted to late-onset ataxia and autoimmune retinopathy, which can be paraneoplastic or not. However, cognitive dysfunction associated with recoverin antibodies has not been reported so far in a homogeneous patient group. Our case series is dedicated to describing the novel phenotype of cognitive impairment associated with recoverin antibodies. We included five patients with cognitive impairment who presented serum recoverin autoantibodies detected by immunoblots in our case series investigation. We also analyzed their psychopathology, clinical data, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuroimaging data. Five patients with cognitive impairment associated with serum recoverin antibodies exhibited profound dysfunctional learning and verbal memory. In the CSF of 40% of them, we also diagnosed axonal neurodegeneration entailing elevated tau and phosphorylated tau protein levels. Psychopathologies such as affective symptoms (restlessness, depressive mood, anxiety, complaintiveness) and formal thought disorder, such as rumination, were detected in 25&amp;amp;ndash;75% of the patients. We hypothesized a role of recoverin autoimmunity in the pineal gland involving consecutive modulation of hippocampus-based memory caused by an altered release of melatonin. We describe a novel phenotype of possible recoverin autoimmunity in patients with cognitive impairment. However, no clear diagnostic clues can be extracted because of the low diagnostic validity of the testing strategies applied. The possibility of recoverin antibody autoimmunity in the pineal gland correlating with a modulation of hippocampus-based memory should be further investigated.</p>

	<p>The stomatognathic system is a functional complex of tissues and organs located within the oral and craniofacial cavities. The craniofacial anatomical factors and the biomechanics of the temporomandibular joints affect many systems throughout the body, including the organ of vision. However, few scientific reports have shown a relationship between the organ of vision and the stomatognathic system. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of connections along neural, muscle-fascial, and biochemical pathways between the organ of vision and the stomatognathic system. Based on the literature presented in this review, the connections between the organ of vision and the stomatognathic system seem undeniable. Understanding the anatomical, physiological, and biochemical interrelationships may allow to explain the interactions between the mentioned systems. According to the current knowledge, it is not possible to indicate the main linking pathway; presumably, it may be a combination of several presented pathways. The awareness of this relationship among dentists, ophthalmologists, physiotherapists, and optometrists should increase for the better diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>

	<p>Pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)/secretin/glucagon superfamily. PACAP is present in two forms (PACAP-38 and PACAP-27) and binds to three guanine-regulatory (G) protein-coupled receptors (PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2). PACAP is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with high PACAP levels found in the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in feeding and energy homeostasis. PAC1 receptors are high-affinity and PACAP-selective receptors, while VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors show a comparable affinity to PACAP and VIP. PACAP and its receptors are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems with moderate to high expression in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and other limbic structures. Consistent with their expression, PACAP is involved in several physiological responses and pathological states. A growing body of literature suggests that PACAP regulates food intake in laboratory animals. However, there is no comprehensive review of the literature on this topic. Thus, the purpose of this article is to review the literature regarding the role of PACAP and its receptors in food intake regulation and to synthesize how PACAP exerts its anorexic effects in different brain regions. To achieve this goal, we searched PubMed and reviewed 68 articles regarding the regulatory action of PACAP on food intake. Here, we present the literature regarding the effect of exogenous PACAP on feeding and the role of endogenous PACAP in this process. We also provide evidence regarding the effect of PACAP on the homeostatic and hedonic aspects of food intake, the neuroanatomical sites where PACAP exerts its regulatory action, which PACAP receptors may be involved, and the role of various signaling pathways and neurotransmitters in hypophagic effects of PACAP.</p>

	<p>Murraya koenigii leaves contain mahanimbine, a carbazole alkaloid, reported with improving cholinergic neuronal transmission and reducing neuroinflammation in the CNS. The current research investigated the effects of mahanimbine on age-related memory deficits, oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, amyloid formation, and neuroinflammation in aged mice (16 months old). Mahanimbine was administered (1 and 2 mg/kg, p.o.) daily to groups of aged mice for 30 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) task was performed to study spatial learning (escape latency (EL) and swimming distance (SD)) and memory (probe test). The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), &amp;amp;beta;-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;1-40 and A&amp;amp;beta;1-42), &amp;amp;beta;-secretase (BACE-1), as well as neuroinflammation markers (total cyclooxygenase (COX) and COX-2 expression), were measured from the isolated brain. Mahanimbine reduced the EL time and SD in the MWM test. From the probe trial, the mahanimbine-treated group spent more time in the targeted quadrant related to the age-matched control, which indicated the enhancement of memory retention. From the biochemical tests, the treatment decreased MDA, AChE, A&amp;amp;beta;1-40, and A&amp;amp;beta;1-42, BACE-1, total COX activity, and COX-2 expression. It also raised the brain GSH and ACh levels in aged mice compared to age-matched control. These results have supported the reversal of memory dysfunctions by mahanimbine in aged mice and hypothesized that it could be a potential target to treat age-related neurodegenerative disease.</p>

	<p>Psychotic disorders often run a chronic course and are associated with a considerable emotional and social impact for patients and their relatives. Therefore, early recognition, combined with the possibility of preventive intervention, is urgently warranted since the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) significantly determines the further course of the disease. In addition to established diagnostic tools, neurobiological factors in the development of schizophrenic psychoses are increasingly being investigated. It is shown that numerous molecular alterations already exist before the clinical onset of the disease. As schizophrenic psychoses are not elicited by a single mutation in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, epigenetics likely constitute the missing link between environmental influences and disease development and could potentially serve as a biomarker. The results from transcriptomic and proteomic studies point to a dysregulated immune system, likely evoked by epigenetic alterations. Despite the increasing knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the development of psychotic disorders, further research efforts with large population-based study designs are needed to identify suitable biomarkers. In conclusion, a combination of blood examinations, functional imaging techniques, electroencephalography (EEG) investigations and polygenic risk scores should be considered as the basis for predicting how subjects will transition into manifest psychosis.</p>

	<p>Expressive language delays and executive functioning challenges are common in youth with Down syndrome (DS). Verbal fluency is one method to investigate these constructs. We examined semantic verbal fluency responses to determine patterns in response generation and the psychometric properties of coded cluster formations. Participants were 97 children and adolescents with DS ranging in age from 6 to 19 years old. The semantic verbal fluency task was administered at two time points, two weeks apart. Heterogeneity in performance was observed for responses when coded either with conventional or contextual classifications. Overall, the number of switches in conventional classifications was greater than contextual classifications. This implies that participants did not use traditional (conventional) categories to organize their semantic verbal fluency responses, but may have been using contextual strategies. However, the number of switches and cluster size variables had poor to moderate test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability, which indicated that participants did not stay consistent with their performance over the two-week testing interval, regardless of the strategies used. Therefore, conventional and contextual clusters and switches as a measure of executive control may not be appropriate for all individuals with DS and additional attention is warranted to determine the utility of response coding in this population.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which visual attention and visual search strategies are altered. Eye-tracking paradigms have been used to detect these changes. In our study, 18 toddlers with ASD and 18 toddlers with typical development (TD; age range 12&amp;amp;ndash;36 months) underwent an eye-tracking paradigm where a face was shown together with a series of objects. Eye gaze was coded according to three areas of interest (AOIs) indicating where the toddlers&amp;amp;rsquo; gaze was directed: &amp;amp;lsquo;Face&amp;amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;lsquo;Object&amp;amp;rsquo;, and &amp;amp;lsquo;No-stimulus fixation&amp;amp;rsquo;. The fixation sequence for the ASD and TD groups was modelled with a Markov chain model, obtaining transition probabilities between AOIs. Our results indicate that the transition between AOIs could differentiate between toddlers with ASD or TD, highlighting different visual exploration patterns between the groups. The sequence of exploration is strictly conditioned based on previous fixations, among which &amp;amp;lsquo;No-stimulus fixation&amp;amp;rsquo; has a critical role in differentiating the two groups. Furthermore, our analyses underline difficulties of individuals with ASD to engage in stimulus exploration. These results could improve clinical and interventional practice by considering this dimension among the evaluation process.</p>

	<p>Children with fragile X syndrome and William Beuren syndrome share several socio-communicative deficits. In both populations, around 30/35% of individuals meets criteria for autism spectrum disorder on gold standard instruments. Notwithstanding, few studies have explored feasibility and validity of therapy for socio-communicative deficits in individuals with these genetic conditions. In this study, we present preliminary data on a pilot RCT aimed to verify the effectiveness of cooperative parent-mediated therapy for socio-communicative deficits in a transdiagnostic perspective in a small sample of 12 participants. Our preliminary data showed that the experimental group had significant improvement in one socio-communicative skill (responsivity) and in clinical global impression, while the control group in an adaptive measure of socialization and word production. Implications of these results are then discussed.</p>

                Background: The exponential increase in pattern of vehicles on the roads demands a need to develop a vehicular infrastructure that may not only ease congestions and provide a better experience but also pivot the levels of safety among users. The development of wireless technology has made it convenient for machines, devices and vehicles to interact with one another. The efficacy of this wireless communications relies on utilising current and available technology to enable information to be shared efficiently. In the wake of the available advancement in wireless technology, a new dynamic spectrum management (DSM) in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication that coexists with the existing Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network to increase the throughput in V2V communication is proposed. This will provide some solutions to enable a more efficient vehicular infrastructure. Methods: This paper focuses on the utilization of DSM in V2V communications by selecting an appropriate frequency band through the selection of available licensed and unlicensed frequency bands for vehicles. Further investigations are done to identify the effect of interference in the dynamic spectrum by observing the path loss, SINR, and the throughput with various interfering users. Results: The results show that the performance of the proposed DSM augments a significant improvement in the overall throughput and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) value is reduced by up to 60% when compared to the fixed spectrum allocation. Conclusions: Although the dynamic spectrum is still affected by the interference from the existing cellular users, the throughput of the dynamic spectrum remains sufficient to transmit the information to other vehicles.

                Purpose: The research evaluates if teachers can achieve better teaching outcomes by using a proposed mobile interactive system (MIS) developed for this study as an additional approach to enhancing teachers’ proficiency in Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in the virtual classroom.   Background: According to previous studies, teachers’ self-assessment on TPACK might be affected by their egos because they have autonomy over the students in the classroom. Some studies suggest that utilisation of an interactive whiteboard (IWB) promotes creativity in teaching and learning but that it is unsuitable for a virtual environment due to its large size and the high maintenance costs associated with owning one in a teacher’s residence. Besides, some studies also reveal that allowing the students to assess their teachers through TPACK  is able to reduce potential errors which might result from the TPACK self-assessment done by teachers.   Methods: Pre- and post- experiments were conducted with the developed MIS integrated into teaching process. Synchronous display (SD) and whiteboard-like freehand writing (WFW) were features of the MIS integrated into the experimental group. Questionnaires were distributed to the students, and a reflective measurement model was formed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS Statistics.   Findings: Based on our findings, teachers’ Technological Content Knowledge had a significant positive effect on TPACK with the inclusion of MIS in online teaching. Predictive relevance was also evaluated through a Q2 value to predict the endogenous construct of the constructed model. The Q2 value was greater than zero, indicating that the model possesses a predictive relevance.   Conclusion: The integration of the developed MIS in the virtual classroom has a significant positive impact on the students’ academic performance relating to concept learning and knowledge acquisition of subject matter.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach to explore multiple infection and evolution in HIV</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jesse Kreger, Natalia L. Komarova, Dominik Wodarz</p>

To study viral evolutionary processes within patients, mathematical models have been instrumental. Yet, the need for stochastic simulations of minority mutant dynamics can pose computational challenges, especially in heterogeneous systems where very large and very small sub-populations coexist. Here, we describe a hybrid stochastic-deterministic algorithm to simulate mutant evolution in large viral populations, such as acute HIV-1 infection, and further include the multiple infection of cells. We demonstrate that the hybrid method can approximate the fully stochastic dynamics with sufficient accuracy at a fraction of the computational time, and quantify evolutionary end points that cannot be expressed by deterministic models, such as the mutant distribution or the probability of mutant existence at a given infected cell population size. We apply this method to study the role of multiple infection and intracellular interactions among different virus strains (such as complementation and interference) for mutant evolution. Multiple infection is predicted to increase the number of mutants at a given infected cell population size, due to a larger number of infection events. We further find that viral complementation can significantly enhance the spread of disadvantageous mutants, but only in select circumstances: it requires the occurrence of direct cell-to-cell transmission through virological synapses, as well as a substantial fitness disadvantage of the mutant, most likely corresponding to defective virus particles. This, however, likely has strong biological consequences because defective viruses can carry genetic diversity that can be incorporated into functional virus genomes via recombination. Through this mechanism, synaptic transmission in HIV might promote virus evolvability.

Urbanowicz, Didier Ndeh, Serena Monaco, Laura Sánchez Salom, Ryan Griffiths, Raven S. Reynolds, Anna Colvile, Daniel I. R. Spencer, Martin Walsh, Jesus Angulo, Nathalie Juge</p>

The human gut symbiont <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> displays strain-specific repertoires of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) contributing to its spatial location in the gut. Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> ATCC 29149, <i>Rg</i>GH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that <i>Rg</i>GH98 is specific for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed <i>Rg</i>GH98 affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular basis of <i>Rg</i>GH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of <i>Rg</i>GH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of <i>Rg</i>GH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that <i>Rg</i>GH98 is part of an operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> ATCC 29149 is grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed <i>Rg</i>GH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that <i>Rg</i>GH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with <i>Rg</i>GH98 confered <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data further support that the GH repertoire of <i>R</i>. <i>gnavus</i> strains enable them to colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, that is, on days 13, 15, 17, or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during, and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY—an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

                Background:  Malnutrition is well-known to yield high morbidities and mortalities and considering its consequence on the oral cavity, malnutrition is shown to have pre-eruptive and post-eruptive outcomes. The objective was to assess the prevalence of hypo-mineralized second primary molar (HSPM), molar–incisor hypo-mineralization (MIH) and dental caries in malnourished children as well as addressing the relation between types of malnutrition of the children and their dental morbidities represented in HSPM, MIH and dental caries. Methods: This is a cross sectional analytical study. Malnourished children aged 5-10 years and presented to the Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University were examined for HSPM. MIH using European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry criteria and dental Caries using def/ DMF indices. Results:  A consecutive sample (a long six months) of 54 malnourished children were enrolled in the study. Dental caries was a greater dental morbidity in the overweight and obese group. Besides, stunting was a greater risk in HSPM and MIH. There was an association between HSPM and MIH in a considerable percentage of the study group. Conclusions: Malnutrition is a risk factor for dental abnormalities. HSPM could expect the presence of MIH.

                Background: The value of Open Science (OS) for the academic community and society has been becoming more evident recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, significant challenges regarding its implementation arise that are likely to affect researchers, especially those in early career stages. Hence, monitoring early-career researchers’ views, knowledge, and skills on OS and related policies, is crucial for its advancement. The main aim of this exploratory study was to gain new perspectives regarding the awareness of and attitudes towards OS and related practices having in consideration geographical, economic and research career variables. Methods: The survey was conducted during May-August 2020 as part of a collaboration between Eurodoc and the Open Research Europe project. The data from the survey were analyzed by European region, Gross domestic product, Gross domestic expenditure on research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product, field of study, and career stage. Results: The awareness and positive attitude regarding OS, specifically among early-career researchers, is high in Europe. However, there are significant career stage group differences in views and knowledge about OS. Generally, awareness and positive attitude tend to increase with increasing career seniority. Regarding European regions, we spotted three main groups sharing similar awareness levels and attitudes: researchers in Western Europe - the most informed group towards OS; researchers in northern, central, and southern Europe - a moderately informed group with some minor differences; and researchers in eastern Europe - the least informed group, whose opinions deviate the most. Conclusions: We found that there is an “evolution of needs and focus” regarding scientific publishing: researchers in most European regions are in different stages of transition from the competitive to collaborative levels, while researchers in eastern Europe are largely beginning their transition to the competitive level.

                Background: Andrographolide (Andro) is a diterpenoid component of the plant Andrographis paniculata that is known for its anti-tumor activity against a variety of cancer cells.   Methods: We studied the effects of Andro on the viability of the human leukemia monocytic cell line THP-1 and the human multiple myeloma cell line H929. Andro was compared with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and vincristine (VCR), which are well-established therapeutics against hematopoietic tumors. The importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for the toxicity of each agent was investigated by using an inhibitor of ROS production, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).    Results:  Andro reduced the viability of THP-1 and H929 in a dose-dependent manner. H929 viability was highly susceptible to Andro, although only slightly susceptible to Ara-C. The agents Andro, Ara-C, and VCR each induced apoptosis, as shown by cellular shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and increases in annexin V-binding, caspase-3/7 activity, ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Whereas Ara-C and VCR increased the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, respectively, Andro showed little or no detectable effect on cell cycle progression. The apoptotic activities of Andro were largely suppressed by NAC, an inhibitor of ROS production, whereas NAC hardly affected the apoptotic activities of Ara-C and VCR.  Conclusions: Andro induces ROS-dependent apoptosis in monocytic leukemia THP-1 and multiple myeloma H929 cells, underlining its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating hematopoietic tumors. The high toxicity for (thus forming: The high toxicity for H929 cells, by a mechanism that is different from that of Ara-C and VCR, is encouraging for further studies on the use of Andro against multiple myeloma.) H929 cells, by a mechanism that is different from that of Ara-C and VCR, is encouraging for further studies on the use of Andro against multiple myeloma.

                A clear understanding of the origin and role of the different subtypes of the B cell lineage involved in the activity or remission of multiple sclerosis (MS) is important for the treatment and follow-up of patients living with this disease. B cells, however, are dynamic and can play an anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory role, depending on their milieu. Depletion of B cells has been effective in controlling the progression of MS, but it can have adverse side effects. A better understanding of the role of the B cell subtypes, through the use of surface biomarkers of cellular activity with special attention to the function of memory and regulatory B cells (Bregs), will be necessary in order to offer specific treatments without inducing undesirable effects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Training strategies for the improvement of NATO Level 2 results for English Functional Level exams in the armed forces [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: As NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries participate in many international missions and joint operations around the world, NATO considered it a necessity for personnel to be able to communicate in a common language. Therefore, one of the main tasks of the NATO multinational setting is the teaching and the assessment of languages. Consequently, there is a need for personnel to achieve the Standard Language Profiles (SLP). Each NATO country must develop SLP exams to achieve the required levels based on NATO STANAG (Standard agreement) 6001. If the examinees do not achieve those levels and the global results are unsatisfactory, NATO members can be affected by a reduction of financial support or the assignment to NATO postings. This study aimed to create a training strategies proposal (TSP) for personnel to achieve NATO L2. Methods: The study consisted of four separate studies: 1) Preliminary survey/interview of military personnel about NATO L2 training; 2) gathering data from NATO L2 exams after normal training; 3) gathering of data from NATO L2 exams after the TSP had been implemented; 4) Post-training survey. Data was collected from examinees over a period of six months or one year, using mixed data collection methods: surveys, interviews, and exam results. Results: A total of 50 examinees took part in the study. Results showed that the number of examinees who passed the NATO L2 increased after going through the TSP. Conclusions: The results show that the TSP, using newer methodologies and different techniques, improved NATO L2 results. The outcomes of this study will help to inform future training and education programs.

                Background: Ethical dilemmas can occur in any situation in clinical medicine. In patients undergoing neuro-anesthesia for surgical procedure evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, anticoagulants should not be given because they can cause recurrent bleeding. Meanwhile, at the same time, the patient could also be infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one of treatment is the administration of anticoagulants. Methods: A case report. A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage due to a hemorrhagic stroke and was confirmed positive for COVID-19. Giving anticoagulants to patients is considered counterproductive so, an ethical dilemma arises. For this reason, a joint conference was held to obtain the best ethical and medicolegal solutions for the patient. Results: By using several methods of resolving ethical dilemmas such as basic ethical principles, supporting ethical principles, and medicolegal considerations, it was decided that the patient was not to be given anticoagulants. Conclusions: Giving anticoagulants to hemorrhagic stroke patients is dangerous even though it is beneficial for COVID-19 patients, so here the principle of risk-benefit balance is applied to patients who prioritize risk prevention rather than providing benefits. This is also supported by the prima facie principle by prioritizing the principle of non-maleficence rather than beneficence, the minus malum principle by seeking the lowest risk, and the double effect principle by making the best decision even in a slightly less favorable way as well as the medicolegal aspect by assessing patient safety and risk management.

                Background - The Malaysian ageing community’s IT aptitude is limited and is a key factor preventing Malaysia’s ageing population from successfully entering Industry 4.0. This study aims to digitalize Malaysian older people with e-commerce. This will require cybersecurity awareness training due to potential cybersecurity threats when conducting business online.    Furthermore, this study advances the Industry 4.0 initiatives set by Malaysia’s National Industry 4.0 Policy Framework by means of a voluntary community-based training program. It also creates a policy that elevates Malaysia’s senior citizens’ current level of ICT innovation baseline commensurate with Industry 4.0 transformation standards.  Methods – Participatory action research was conducted with members in a Senior Citizen Activity Centre (PAWE) through focus group discussions. Each focus group consisted of 6-8 people. Through identifying the community’s problem in the focus groups, an e-commerce platform was developed for the elderly to commercialise their existing products. The dissemination of e-commerce training and cybersecurity awareness were also conducted as part of mitigating fraud relating to online transactions.    Results – The findings show that PAWE members’ IT aptitude was limited, that they needed assistance with understanding the e-commerce platform, and that they had limited cybersecurity awareness.   Conclusions – The country’s ageing population programs and services are preparing for an ageing nation. In order for Malaysia’s ageing population to become self-sustainable, researchers suggest that Malaysian older persons become entrepreneurs. Third generation entrepreneurs must also be supported by social innovation, technological innovation, and cybersecurity awareness, which leads to achieving IR 4.0 and meets the economic, social and sustainable environmental goals.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is a dynamic process that is based on and can be altered by experiences. Integrating memories of multiple experiences (memory integration) is the basis of flexible and complex decision-making. However, the mechanism of memory integration in neural networks of the brain remains poorly understood. In this study, we built a recurrent spiking network model and investigated the neural mechanism of memory integration before a decision is made (retrospective memory integration) at the neural circuit level. Our simulations suggest that retrospective memory integration accompanies reconfiguration of neural cell assemblies. Additionally, partially blocking neural network plasticity leads to failure of memory integration. These findings can potentially guide the experimental investigation of the neural mechanism of retrospective memory integration and serve as the basis for developing new artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

                <p>Current therapeutic development in ALS relies on individual randomized clinical trials to test a specific investigational product in a single patient population. This approach has intrinsic limitations including cost, time, and lack of flexibility. Adaptive platform trials represent a novel approach to investigate several interventions for a single disease in a continuous manner. Already in use in oncology, this approach is now being employed more often in neurology. Here, we describe a newly launched, platform trial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is testing multiple investigational products concurrently in people with ALS, with the goal of rapidly identifying novel treatments, biomarkers, and trial endpoints.</p>

     alt="Adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity due to peripheral nerve hyperexcitability based on voltage-gated potassium channel downregulation in male mice"/>
<p>We have shown that adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity, which may be caused by decreased expression of Kv1.1 in the sciatic nerve. Such decrease caused disruption of latency delay and amplitude decrease under the train-pulse stimulation of this nerve.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thyroid hormones play an important role in the central and peripheral nervous system functions. Approximately 50% of adult-onset hypothyroid patients have sensory symptoms including pain, possibly caused by peripheral neuropathy. However, the mechanism causing the pain has not been clarified. We generated an adult-onset hypothyroid model animal by administering 50 ppm propylthiouracil (PTU) for 5 weeks to male mice. Female mice were not tested in this study. Mechanical hypersensitivity, determined by the von Frey hair test, was observed during the PTU exposure and recovered after the exposure termination. The sciatic nerve compound action potential was also analyzed. Under single-pulse stimulation, no significant change in the threshold and conduction velocity was observed in the PTU-administered group. On the other hand, under train-pulse stimulation, the latency delay in the Aδ-fiber component was less in the PTU-administered group in Week 4 of PTU exposure, indicating relative hyperexcitability. Fluticasone, which is the anti-inflammatory agent with an ability to activate the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily A (Kv1), restored the decrease in the latency change ratio by PTU exposure under the train-pulse stimulation supporting our hypothesis that Kv1 may be involved in the conductivity change. Kv1.1 protein level decreased significantly in the sciatic nerve of the PTU-administered group. These results indicate that adult-onset hypothyroidism causes mechanical hypersensitivity owing to hyperexcitability of the peripheral nerve and that reduction of Kv1.1 level may be involved in such alteration.</p>

     alt="Homeostatic regulation of neuronal excitability by probiotics in male germ-free mice"/>
<p>Probiotics, <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i>, induce homeostatic changes in the excitability of hippocampal neurons in a gut microbiome status-dependent manner in male germ-free mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that probiotics can influence the gut–brain axis to ameliorate somatic and behavioral symptoms associated with brain disorders. However, whether probiotics have effects on the electrophysiological activities of individual neurons in the brain has not been evaluated at a single-neuron resolution, and whether the neuronal effects of probiotics depend on the gut microbiome status have yet to be tested. Thus, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording-assisted electrophysiological characterizations of the neuronal effects of probiotics in male germ-free (GF) mice with and without gut microbiome colonization. Two weeks of treatment with probiotics (<i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i>) significantly and selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas reconstituting gut microbiota in GF mice reversed the effects of the probiotics leading to a decreased intrinsic excitability in hippocampal neurons. This bidirectional modulation of neuronal excitability by probiotics was observed in hippocampal neurons with corresponding basal membrane property and action potential waveform changes. However, unlike the hippocampus, the amygdala excitatory neurons did not show any electrophysiological changes to the probiotic treatment in either GF or conventionalized GF mice. Our findings demonstrate for the first time how probiotic treatment can have a significant influence on the electrophysiological properties of neurons, bidirectionally modulating their intrinsic excitability in a gut microbiota and brain area-specific manner.</p>

     alt="Increased structural covariance in brain regions for number processing and memory in children with developmental dyscalculia"/>
<p>In our work, we examined typically developing children and children with developmental dyscalculia by structural brain imaging. Our results suggest that developmental dyscalculia might be partially explained by delayed neuronal maturation. Our structural measure can be applied in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity deficit or autism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a developmental learning disability associated with deficits in processing numerical and mathematical information. Several studies demonstrated functional network alterations in DD. Yet, there are no studies, which examined the structural network integrity in DD. We compared whole-brain maps of volume based structural covariance between 19 (4 males) children with DD and 18 (4 males) typically developing children. We found elevated structural covariance in the DD group between the anterior intraparietal sulcus to the middle temporal and frontal gyrus (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, corrected). A hippocampus subfield analysis showed higher structural covariance in the DD group for area CA3 to the parahippocampal and calcarine sulcus, angular gyrus and anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus as well as to the lingual gyrus. Lower structural covariance in this group was seen for the subiculum to orbitofrontal gyrus, anterior insula and middle frontal gyrus. In contrast, the primary motor cortex (control region) revealed no difference in structural covariance between groups. Our results extend functional magnetic resonance studies by revealing abnormal gray matter integrity in children with DD. These findings thus indicate that the pathophysiology of DD is mediated by both structural and functional abnormalities in a network involved in number processing and memory function.</p>
