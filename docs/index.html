                Introduction This scoping review aims to map the current status, challenges, and best practices in translating health sciences curricula into indigenous languages in Sub-Saharan Africa. While learning in one’s native language enhances comprehension and retention, there is limited synthesis of translation practices in the region. The review will examine which indigenous languages are represented in curricula, what aspects of the curricula have been translated, and the methodologies employed in translation efforts. Methods The review will follow the JBI methodology for scoping reviews and adhere to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Relevant literature will be sourced from MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, African Journals Online (AJOL), and African Index Medicus, alongside gray literature from organizational websites and government repositories. Three independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full texts, with data extracted using a customized form aligned with the research questions. The analysis will identify patterns, trends, and gaps in current translation practices. Results This review will provide insights for educational institutions, policymakers, and researchers, offering recommendations for improving healthcare education accessibility in Sub-Saharan Africa. It will inform evidence-based guidelines for curriculum translation and highlight areas for further research. Discussion Understanding translation practices and identifying challenges will support efforts to enhance the delivery of healthcare education and reduce health disparities in indigenous communities. The findings will help inform policy and practice aimed at improving health education access, cultural inclusivity, and the overall effectiveness of health curricula in the region. The scoping review has been registered on OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/AU2SD

                Introduction Autoimmune diseases often require long-term management and significantly affect patients’ physical and mental health. Conventional management strategies emphasize disease control and symptom relief, notwithstanding, the integration of positive health models such as the flourishing framework remains underexplored. Objective This protocol outlines a scoping review aimed to map and analyze how the flourishing framework has been applied in research and practice in autoimmune context. Methods Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we will systematically search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Studies will be screened using predetermined eligibility criteria. Data will be extracted and charted using a standardize form and will be analyzed narratively by presenting key characteristics and thematic trends. Conclusion The findings from this scoping review will provide a foundational insight into how flourishing is conceptualized, measured, and applied in the context of autoimmune disease. Thus, informing future research and integrative care models.

                General overview of artificial intelligence (AI) designed for academic students, workers, researchers, and teachers. A less technical introduction for those not familiar with computer science. It focuses primarily on generative AI (Gen AI), as this is the tool rapidly transforming every aspect of academic work. This primer covers four areas: 1. How does AI know what it knows? – An overview of artificial neural networks, large language models and “knowledge” ; 2. Ethics and best practices – Use cases, legal aspects and oversight; 3. Sources and tools - Support for the research process; 4. Prompting - Strategies to optimize interaction with Gen AI.

                Background Disability is widely acknowledged as a major contributor to depression, which is a prevalent mental health condition that profoundly affects individuals, especially those with visual impairments. Objectives This develops a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aim to examine the prevalence and incidence of depression among visually impaired people globally. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A thorough search will be conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ProQuest databases to identify relevant studies published between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2024, without limitations on language. Two out of three independent reviewers will screen the abstracts and full-text articles, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity among the included studies will be evaluated individually. Meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence and incidence estimates will be conducted using the metaprop function in StataBE 18.0. Publication bias will be assessed through funnel plot analysis and Egger’s test. Conclusion This protocol defines the planned scope and methodology for a forthcoming systematic review and meta-analysis, which aims to provide updated evidence on the prevalence and incidence of depression among individuals with visual impairment. Accordingly, it will facilitate a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the existing research gap by providing precise estimates of the pooled prevalence and incidence of depression in this population. The findings will offer valuable insights to inform public health policy, advocate for further research, and underscore the critical need to prioritize the mental health concerns of individuals with visual impairment. Systematic review registration The protocol has been registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) Registries with the Registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/6J4Y2.

                Background There is an ongoing need to develop diverse career paths that support the vital contributions of staff scientists, research engineers, scientific officers, and other knowledge professionals in scientific discovery. Research infrastructures and core facilities have a particular need to support sustainable and diverse careers, as they either employ – if being a legal entity – or daily manage research professionals in a broad variety of roles to enable resources, services, and innovation. Methods In 2019, a survey of the facility staff at SciLifeLab, a large national research infrastructure in Sweden, led to a recommendation for universities to develop career paths for their staff scientists. Five years later, we have conducted a survey and workshop to determine current views of infrastructure staff on career path diversity in Sweden. Results Our results indicate there is a strong need for clarity and communication about planning and implementation of career path structures at Swedish universities, as well as opportunities to foster excellence in infrastructure staff. While the workshop participants ranked Sweden as a stable and attractive place to work and reported continuous development of their technical and service skills, the lack of recognition of this expertise presents a barrier to a sustainable career. Conclusions We conclude that there is a need to continue advocating for increased clarity and diversity in career paths for staff scientists in Sweden, and raise the views presented by infrastructure staff on the challenges and opportunities unique to their roles.

<p>Curumin exerted neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt pathway.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic epilepsy is mainly characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/phosphatase and tensin homolog/protein kinase B (PPARγ/PTEN/Akt) pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of SRS and neuronal loss. Curcumin is a natural compound, and previous studies have shown it provides neuroprotection via anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In the present study, we show that curcumin regulates the abnormal expression of PTEN and Akt in the SRS phase, improves the neuronal loss in the hippocampus, and suppresses SRS development and seizure spike activity in epileptic rats. More importantly, these effects are reversed by the PPARγ antagonist, T0070907, suggesting that curcumin exerts neuroprotective and anti-epileptic effects through the PPARγ/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Other studies have shown that curcumin can cross the BBB and has a safety profiles and pleiotropic pharmacological effects. Thus, our data support the proposition that curcumin might be a potential neuroprotective and anti-epileptic agent for chronic epilepsy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-651/v1?src=rss">An Explainable Transfer Learning based Residual Attention BiLSTM Model for Fair and Accurate Prognosis of Ischemic Heart Disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. Fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that B cells imprinted by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 have tremendous potential to develop neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated immune recalls driven by Omicron variants, supporting that ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting can be harnessed in developing pan-SARS-CoV-2 and even cross-sarbecovirus vaccines.

                Feng et al. determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of KP.3.1.1 and other mutant spike proteins and find that an S31 deletion introduces N30 glycosylation. They demonstrate that S31 deletion and N30 glycosylation do not affect the spike conformation, hACE2 binding, and antibody RBD binding but do knock out some antibody NTD binding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88588">Competence for transcellular infection in the root cortex involves a post-replicative, cell-cycle exit decision in Medicago truncatula</a></h4>

              
                During root nodule symbiosis (RNS), cell-division activity is reinitiated and sustained in the root cortex to create a hospitable cellular niche. Such a temporary and spatially confined site is required to render host cells compatible with the intracellular progression of rhizobia. Although it has been suggested that early infection events might involve a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest, this process has not been dissected with cellular resolution. Here, we show that a dual-color <i>Medicago</i> histone reporter robustly identifies cells with different mitotic or endoreduplication activities in the root cortex. By imaging deep root tissues, we found that a confined trajectory of cortical cells that are transcellularly passed by infection threads is in a stage of the cell cycle that is distinct from directly adjacent cells. Distinctive features of infected cells include nuclear widening and large-scale chromatin rearrangements consistent with a cell-cycle exit prior to differentiation. Using a combination of fluorescent reporters demarcating cell-cycle phase progression, we confirmed that a reduced proliferation potential and modulating the G2/M transition, a process possibly controlled by the NF-YA1 transcription factor, mark the success of rhizobial delivery to nodule cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88376">The interplay between homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity maintains the robust firing rate of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Critical network states and neural plasticity enable adaptive behavior in dynamic environments, supporting efficient information processing and experience-dependent learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling are key mechanisms that enable memory while stabilizing network dynamics. However, the role of structural plasticity as a homeostatic mechanism remains less consistently reported, particularly under activity inhibition, leading to an incomplete understanding of its functional impact. In this study, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGFP-labeled neurons in mouse organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures (Thy1-eGFP mice of both sexes) with computational modeling to investigate how synapse-number-based structural plasticity responds to activity perturbations and interacts with homeostatic synaptic scaling. Tracking individual dendritic segments, we found that inhibiting excitatory neurotransmission does not monotonically regulate dendritic spine density. Specifically, inhibition of AMPA receptors with 200 nM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX) increased spine density, whereas complete AMPA receptor blockade with 50 μM NBQX reduced it. Motivated by these findings, we developed network simulations incorporating a biphasic structural plasticity rule governing activity-dependent synapse formation. These simulations showed that the biphasic rule maintains neural activity homeostasis under stimulation and permits either synapse formation or synapse loss depending on the degree of activity deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling further modulated recurrent connectivity, network activity, and structural plasticity outcomes. It reduced stimulation-triggered synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights and rescued silencing-induced synapse loss by upscaling recurrent input, thus reactivating silent neurons. The interaction between these mechanisms provides a mechanistic explanation for divergent findings in the literature. In summary, homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity dynamically compete and compensate for each other, ensuring efficient and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88174">Cestode larvae excite host neuronal circuits via glutamatergic signalling</a></h4>

              
                Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is caused by infection of the brain by larvae of the parasitic cestode <i>Taenia solium</i>. It is the most prevalent parasitic infection of the central nervous system and one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. However, little is known about how cestode larvae affect neurons directly. To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in rodent and human brain slices to identify direct effects of cestode larval products on neuronal activity. We found that both whole cyst homogenate and excretory/secretory products of cestode larvae have an acute excitatory effect on neurons, which can trigger seizure-like events <i>in vitro</i>. This effect was mediated by glutamate receptor activation but not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels, or Substance P. Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and amino acid assays revealed that the larval homogenate of the cestodes <i>Taenia crassiceps</i> and <i>Taenia solium</i> contained high concentrations of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, we found that larvae of both species consistently produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that perturbations in glutamatergic signalling may play a role in seizure generation in NCC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98634">Multifaceted role of galanin in brain excitability</a></h4>

              
                Galanin is a neuropeptide, which is critically involved in homeostatic processes like controlling arousal, sleep, and regulation of stress. This extensive range of functions aligns with implications of galanin in diverse pathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression, and epilepsy. Here, we investigated the regulatory function of galanin on whole-brain activity in larval zebrafish using wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Combining this with genetic perturbations of galanin signaling and pharmacologically increasing neuronal activity, we are able to probe actions of galanin across the entire brain. Our findings demonstrate that under unperturbed conditions and during epileptic seizures, galanin exerts a sedative influence on the brain, primarily through the galanin receptor 1 a (<i>galr1a</i>). However, exposure to acute stressors like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) compromises galanin’s sedative effects, leading to overactivation of the brain and increased seizure occurrence. Interestingly, galanin’s impact on seizures appears to be bidirectional, as it can both decrease seizure severity and increase seizure occurrence, potentially through different galanin receptor subtypes. This nuanced interplay between galanin and various physiological processes underscores its significance in modulating stress-related pathways and suggests its potential implications for neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Taken together, our data sheds light on a multifaceted role of galanin, where galanin regulates whole-brain activity but also shapes acute responses to stress.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104164">Drosophila hamlet mediates epithelial tissue assembly of the reproductive system</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial tissue fusion requires coordinated molecular events at the ends of two epithelial structures. Regulatory mechanisms controlling these events remain largely elusive. In the <i>Drosophila</i> reproductive system (RS), this fusion unites the gonad and the genital disc-derived tissues, into a continuous tube. This study unveils the pivotal role of Hamlet (Ham), a <i>Drosophila</i> PR domain containing transcription factor, in orchestrating epithelial tissue fusion in the RS. Loss of <i>ham</i> leads to sterility and disconnection between the testes and seminal vesicles. Systematic analysis of Ham downstream genes reveals cytoskeletal, metabolic regulators and signaling pathway components. Ham activates genes for epithelial differentiation and remodeling, while repressing genes required for tissue growth and patterning. Using multiplexed in situ hybridization, we demonstrate spatial–temporal gene expression dynamics in contacting epithelia. Key Ham downstream effectors include E-Cadherin (E-Cad), Toll (Tl), and Wnt2 signaling pathways, regulating tissue interaction and fusion. Our findings present a comprehensive gene network crucial for heterotypic epithelial tissue fusion. Mammalian Ham orthologs PRDM3 and PRDM16 are highly expressed in epithelial tissues, suggesting a conserved role across species.

">Natural gradient Bayesian sampling: an innate algorithm emerges in canonical cortical circuits</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating evidence suggests the canonical cortical circuit, consisting of excitatory (E) and diverse classes of inhibitory (I) interneurons, implement sampling-based Bayesian inference to compute stimulus posteriors. However, most of the identified sampling algorithms in the circuit are still simpler than the nonlinear circuit dynamics. Through comprehensive theoretical analyses of the nonlinear circuit dynamics, we discover the canonical circuit dynamics innately implements natural gradient Bayesian sampling, which is an advanced sampling algorithm that adaptively adjusts the sampling step size based on the local geometry of stimulus posteriors measured by Fisher information. Specifically, the nonlinear circuit dynamics can implement natural gradient Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling of uni- and multi-variate stimulus posteriors, and these algorithms can be switched by interneurons. We also find that the non-equilibrium circuit dynamics when transitioning from the resting to evoked state can further accelerate natural gradient sampling, and analytically identify the neural circuit's annealing strategy. Remarkably, we identify the approximated computational strategies employed in the circuit dynamics, which even resemble the ones widely used in machine learning. Our work provides an overarching connection between canonical circuit dynamics and advanced sampling algorithms, deepening our understanding of the circuit algorithms of Bayesian sampling.

">Molecular Dynamics in the Ventral Tegmental Area during Chronic Pain-Induced Negative Affect</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain frequently coexists with negative affect, with about 60% of patients suffering from both. This dual condition complicates treatment and exacerbates both disorders, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Chronic pain negative affect (CPNA) involves complex neurobiological changes, including increased hyperexcitability of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical region involved in reward, mood, and pain processing. To elucidate CPNA's underlying mechanisms, we employed a multidisciplinary approach using immunohistochemistry, lipidomic analysis, and proteomic screening to investigate VTA molecular alterations in mice subjected to partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) at one and four weeks post-injury. Our results revealed a significant, sex-dependent increase in Kv7.2 channel expression in dopamine neurons, alongside a notable reduction in endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels, which plays a vital role in mood regulation. This neurochemical shift associated with an increase in negative affect-like behaviors, as determined by the forced swim test. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention utilizing either exogenous 2-AG or retigabine, a Kv7 channel opener, effectively alleviated pain-related negative affect symptoms. Proteomic profiling further uncovered alterations within the CaMKK2 pathway, involving crucial proteins such as PLC{gamma}2, AMPK{gamma}2, and AMPK{beta}1, and CaMK1, with changes in abundance and phosphorylation activity that could be reversed with the next-generation CaMK1 antagonist CS640. This research provides the first comprehensive analyses of VTA adaptations linked to CPNA, yielding significant insights into molecular changes impacting VTA neuronal integrity and signaling throughout CPNA progression.

">A NEST-based framework unlocks massively parallel simulation of networks of multicompartment neurons with customizable subcellular dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                While the implementation of learning and memory in the brain is governed in large part by subcellular mechanisms in the dendrites of neurons, large-scale network simulations featuring such processes remain challenging to achieve. This can be attributed to a lack of appropriate software tools, as neuroscientific simulation software focuses on the one hand on highly detailed models, and on the other hand on massive networks featuring point-neurons. Here, we fill this gap by implementing a framework for the massively parallel simulation of simplified dendrite models with customizable subcellular dynamics. To achieve this, we leverage the NEural Simulation Tool (NEST), the neuroscientific reference with respect to efficient massively parallel simulations of point neuron networks. By co-opting the already existing model descriptions language NESTML, we generate C++ code implementing user-configurable subcellular dynamics. Through benchmarking and profiling, we show that the generated models run efficiently, leading to scalable NEST network simulations. We demonstrate relevant functionalities by showing that a key sensory computation - the association of top-down context arriving at distal dendrites in layer 1 and feedforward sensory input arriving perisomatically - can be achieved in a single shot fashion through apical calcium dynamics. Our work thus unlocks the study of how dendritic processes shape learning, and in particular of how brain-wide communication through long-range, layer 1-targetting connections steers perisomatic plasticity.

">Parietal top-down projections balance flexibility and stability in adaptive learning</a></h4>

              
                The ability to flexibly modify behavior in response to changing environmental contingencies is fundamental to adaptive decision-making, yet how distributed brain circuits coordinate such rapid adaptation remains unclear. Here, we show that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) facilitates adaptive learning via parallel projections to the auditory cortex (AC) and inferior colliculus (IC). In a within-session auditory reversal task, AC neurons supported flexible stimulus updating following rule reversal, whereas IC neurons preserved stable auditory discrimination across rules. Dual retrograde tracing revealed anatomically segregated PPC neurons projecting to AC (PPCAC) and IC (PPCIC). PPCAC neurons flexibly encoded stimulus-outcome contingencies, while PPCIC neurons stably represented response outcomes. Circuit-specific optogenetic inactivation confirmed their distinct contributions to behavioral adaptation. This double dissociation reveals a circuit mechanism by which parallel PPC projections coordinate flexible rule updating and stable motor execution, enabling rapid behavioral adaptation and providing a mechanistic framework for cognitive flexibility.

">Recognizing EEG responses to active TMS vs. sham stimulations in different TMS-EEG datasets: a machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous Electroencephalogram (TMS-EEG) allows assessing the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons. However, TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) can be affected by components unrelated to TMS direct neuronal activation. Accurate, automatic tools are therefore needed to establish the quality of TEPs. Objective: To assess the discriminability of EEG responses to TMS vs. EEG responses to sham stimulations using sequence-to-sequence machine learning (ML). Methods: Two indipendent TMS-EEG datasets including TMS and several sham stimulation conditions were obtained from the left motor area of healthy volunteers (N=33 across datasets). A Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) ML network was used to label each time point of the EEG signals as pertaining to TMS or sham conditions. Main outcome measures included accuracy at single-trial level and after averaging five to twenty trials. Results: For TMS conditions, post-stimulus vs. baseline/pre-stimulus EEG comparisons yielded moderate (60%-75%) single-trial accuracy and high-accuracy (>75%) for 20 trials across datasets, while for sham conditions post- vs. baseline/pre-stimulus EEG comparisons yielded lower accuracy rates than for TMS conditions, except for unmasked auditory stimulation. Furthermore, baseline/pre-stimulus TMS vs. baseline/pre-stimulus sham EEG comparisons showed chance-level accuracy, whereas post-stimulus TMS vs. post-stimulus sham EEG comparisons had moderate (single trial) to high (20 trial) accuracy, except for TMS with and without the click noise masking. Single-subject findings were comparable to group-level results across datasets. Conclusions: TEPs after active TMS are discernible from various sham stimulations even after a handful of trials and at the single-subject level using a BiLSTM ML approach.

">TMC1 and TMC2 are cholesterol-dependent scramblases that regulate membrane homeostasis in auditory hair cells</a></h4>

              
                TMC1 and TMC2, the pore-forming subunits of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) complex in inner ear sensory hair cells, are essential for auditory and vestibular function. Pathogenic mutations in TMC1 are a leading cause of genetic hearing loss, but their underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that TMC1 and TMC2 are cholesterol-regulated lipid scramblases whose activity modulates plasma membrane asymmetry. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that both proteins facilitate phospholipid translocation across membrane bilayers, a process tuned by cholesterol and enhanced by deafness-causing TMC1 mutations. We show that this scramblase activity correlates with TMC1-dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine and membrane blebbing in murine auditory hair cells, linking TMC1-dependent membrane homeostasis dysregulation to auditory sensory cell pathology. These findings identify TMCs as a novel family of lipid scramblases, advancing our understanding of MET complex biology and offering mechanistic insight into membrane-driven forms of hereditary deafness.

">Task-evoked functional connectivity exhibits novel and strengthened relationships with executive function relative to the resting state</a></h4>

              
                Executive functioning in children has been linked to intrinsic brain network organization assessed during the resting state, as well as to brain network organization during the performance of cognitive tasks. Prior work has established that task-based brain networks are stronger predictors of behavior than resting state networks, yet it is unclear if tasks only strengthen relationships that exist weakly at rest or if tasks also evoke unique relationships. A lack of discernment regarding how tasks and the resting state commonly and uniquely support executive functions precludes a holistic understanding of the neurobiological basis of executive functions. This project investigated differences in brain network organization and relationships with executive function ability between the resting state and two executive function tasks, a stop signal task and an emotional n-back task, using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset. Both executive function tasks evoked a more integrated network organization than the resting state, and executive function ability was related to different aspects of brain network organization during the resting state and during the tasks. Further, task-related shifts in brain network organization evoked several new relationships with executive function that were not detectable during the resting state and strengthened a relationship with executive function that existed weakly during the resting state. Overall, this study establishes a distinction between common and unique features of intrinsic and task-evoked brain function that facilitate executive function in children.

">Multimodal sensory overload in dopamine-deficient larval zebrafish leads to paradoxical kinesia</a></h4>

              
                Paradoxical kinesia, the temporary alleviation of motor deficits by powerful, urgent stimuli in Parkinson's disease (PD), remains poorly understood at the neural circuit level. Through chemo-genetic ablation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in larval zebrafish and brain-wide calcium imaging under head-fixed, tail-free conditions, we uncovered a neural mechanism underlying this phenomenon. While catecholamine (CA)-deficient larvae exhibited severe locomotor deficits during free swimming, they showed paradoxical recovery of tail movements during whole-brain neural activity imaging. This locomotor recovery was accompanied by a significantly increased number of active neurons in the midbrain and hindbrain, but with reduced firing rates. Further analyses across 2158 anatomically defined regions allowed us to uncover a subset of regions, genes, and neurotransmitter types. GABAergic neurons were found to primarily account for the hyperactivity in the hindbrain, while glutamatergic neurons accounted for the hyperactivity in the midbrain. Hierarchical clustering of neuronal activity with tail movements revealed distinct motor- and non-motor-associated hyperactive clusters in the hindbrain and midbrain, respectively. We identified the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR) sandwiched between these domains, with enhanced glutamatergic firing rate and cholinergic activation. Furthermore, we found that Telencephalic corticotropin-releasing factor b (crhb) expressing neurons play a crucial role in mediating stress-response to the tectum, which in turn triggers a cascade of neuronal hyperactivity downstream via MLR. These findings reveal a neural mechanism that links stress-induced sensory processing with motor control systems in the absence of regulatory feedback from catecholaminergic neurons, suggesting a direct, unmodulated pathway that bypasses typical inhibitory controls.

">Targeted ablation and regeneration of enteric nervous system neurons in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the intrinsic nervous system of the gut and regulates essential gut functions, including motility, digestion, and immune response, ensuring gut homeostasis. ENS dysfunction or loss is associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Currently, surgery is the only treatment for HSCR, but it often has lifelong, severe complications. Restoring missing ENS neurons by stimulating endogenous neuronal regeneration presents a promising therapeutic approach for ENS disease. To study the cellular-molecular mechanisms of neuronal regeneration we first need to identify an animal model system with robust ENS regeneration. For this, we developed a chemical-genetic ablation model in zebrafish using the Gal4/UAS NTR 2.0 system for targeted ENS neuron ablation. Spatially and temporally controlled neuronal death was confirmed by morphological changes, complete neuronal loss, and TUNEL assays. Quantification of regenerated neurons demonstrated complete restoration of ENS neuron numbers to control levels by 9 days post treatment with recovery of gut motility. Among the regenerated neurons, nitrergic, cholinergic and vipergic subtypes showed full recovery, whereas serotonergic neurons only displayed partial recovery, indicating subtype-specific differences in the regenerative capacity and/or timing. Our study establishes a robust platform for dissecting the cellular molecular mechanisms of ENS regeneration to develop potential treatment approaches for ENS-related diseases.

">Low and high frequency signatures of impaired consciousness in temporal lobe seizures</a></h4>

              
                Impaired consciousness is a debilitating and unpredictable outcome of mesial temporal lobe seizures whose mechanisms to date remain unclear. Moreover, questions about the relationship between impaired consciousness and lateralization, hemispheric spread and electrophysiological characteristics of seizures are yet to be answered. To address these gaps, we conducted in-depth investigation of behavioral and intracranial EEG data from 186 mesial temporal lobe seizures of 51 patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We found that bilateral mesial temporal spread of seizures is not a necessary condition for impaired consciousness, although seizures with bilateral mesial temporal involvement were significantly more likely to have impaired consciousness than unilateral seizures. Contrary to prior belief, we found no relationship between the onset side (left vs. right temporal lobe or language dominant vs. non-dominant lobe) of seizures and the probability of impaired consciousness. Lastly, we established that widespread increases in slow-wave activity (delta band) in extratemporal cortical areas, as well as increases in fast activity (beta band) in the temporal lobes were both robust markers of seizures with impaired consciousness and could predict ictal impairment with up to 86% accuracy. Our findings shed new light on networks that underlie impaired consciousness in temporal lobe epilepsy and may help guide deep brain stimulation of such systems (e.g. via thalamic nuclei) as a potential intervention to improve consciousness during seizures.

">Adaptive changes of cholinergic projections to the nucleus accumbens bidirectionally mediate cocaine reinforcing effects</a></h4>

              
                The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) sends critical inputs to distinct reward circuit regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but their functional role in addiction-related behaviors remains underexplored. Here, we demonstrate that LDT-NAc cholinergic projections undergo cocaine-induced adaptations and modulate cocaine-related behaviors. Using cell type-specific tracing, we show that LDT neurons preferentially innervate NAc medium spiny neurons and cholinergic interneurons. Large-scale in vivo recordings reveal that cocaine pre-exposure induces persistent alterations in both LDT and NAc neuronal dynamics and modifies responses to subsequent cocaine challenge. Remarkably, pre-exposure to cocaine triggers population-specific adaptations in the LDT, selectively enhancing excitability of LDT-NAc-projecting cholinergic neurons while reducing that of non-projecting cholinergic cells. Behaviorally, optogenetic activation of LDT-NAc cholinergic projections enhances cocaine conditioning, whereas their inhibition diminishes reinforcing effects of cocaine. Our findings identify LDT-NAc cholinergic inputs as key substrates of cocaine-induced plasticity, and critical mediators of the rewarding properties of cocaine, introducing a novel component to addiction circuitry.

">WaveLimit: An optimal spike sorting inclusion boundary</a></h4>

              
                Spike sorting is the process of assigning neuronal action potentials to individual putative neurons based on extracellular recordings. Spike sorting may be partitioned into five major components: i) raw neural data is filtered, ii) spiking events are extracted as waveforms, iii) features are extracted from the waveforms, iv) clusters of waveforms are defined, and v) individual waveforms are assigned to their respective clusters. Here, we focus on the often underappreciated fifth component, deriving a useful principle to define a cluster boundary to maximize the theoretical information available from a single neuron. We implemented this boundary, along with an automatic cluster identifier, in a novel spike sorting algorithm, WaveLimit. We then compared WaveLimit to three state-of-the-art spike sorters. WaveLimit identified either the same or more units and included more spiking events per unit than the other sorters. WaveLimit also found units with fewer inter-spike interval violations and higher signal-to-noise ratios. Thus, better defining the cluster boundary improved spike sorting.

">Methodological determinants of signal quality in electrobulbogram recordings</a></h4>

              
                The electrobulbogram (EBG) is a new, non-invasive method for measuring the functional activity of the human olfactory bulb (OB). To date, the EBG has been used to assess how the OB process odor identity, valence, intensity, and it has shown promise as an early biomarker for Parkinson's disease. However, current implementation of the EBG method depends on several methodological components, including subject specific co-registration of electrode positions through neuronavigation and EEG source reconstruction, which may limit accessibility for many research groups. In this study, we test the quality and reliability of the OB signal under different configurations to potentially remedy this. Specifically, we compare six EBG setups that vary in the use of subject-specific T1 scans versus a template head model, co-registered versus template electrode positions, and individualized versus template-based OB location. Our results indicate that strongest EBG signals are obtained when using subject-specific T1 scans in combination with co-registered electrode positions. However, we obtained significant EBG activity even when using a fully template-based configuration. Our anatomical analysis of OB location of 941 individuals reveals that in 86% of cases, the OB is centered within the spatial resolution bounds of the EEG source dipole, supporting the feasibility of detecting olfactory bulb signals without precise individual anatomical mapping using template coordinates. These findings suggest that while subject-specific configurations enhance signal quality, the EBG method remains robust enough to yield meaningful results even with less complex setups. This enables a broader adoption of the EBG method in both clinical and research settings.

">The role of feedback for sensorimotor decisions under risk</a></h4>

              
                For goal-directed movements like throwing darts or shooting a soccer penalty, the optimal location to aim depends on the endpoint variability of an individual. Currently, there is no consensus whether people can optimize their movement planning based on information about their motor variability. Here, we tested the role of different types of feedback for movement planning under risk. We measured saccades towards a bar that consisted of a reward and a penalty region. Participants either received error-based feedback about their endpoint or reinforcement feedback about the resulting reward. We additionally manipulated the feedback schedule to assess the role of feedback frequency and whether feedback focusses on individual trials or a group of trials. Participants with trial-by-trial reinforcement feedback performed best and had the least endpoint deviation from optimality. Our results are consistent with a slow gradual drift in the participants' internal aiming location under summary feedback. Feedback focusing on individual trials reduces this drift, thereby enabling consistent movement planning from one trial to the next. Our results therefore suggest that reinforcement feedback about a single movement is most effective to optimize movement planning under risk.

">FREQ-NESS reveals age-related differences in frequency-resolved brain networks during auditory recognition and resting state</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how brain networks operate across different frequencies during cognitive tasks, and how these dynamics change with age, remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While previous studies have focused on resting-state activity and passive listening, less is known about frequency-specific brain dynamics during event-related tasks that require active memory engagement. In this study, we extend the recently developed FREQ-NESS analytical pipeline by adapting it to event-related task and resting state source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 70 healthy participants. This method quantified the variance explained by frequency-specific brain networks, their spatial organization, and associated time-resolved power estimates. We found significant effects of age, condition, and their interaction in the variance explained by leading components at 1.07 Hz, 2.86 Hz, and 10.00 Hz. Younger adults exhibited stronger peaks at 1.07 and 2.86 Hz during the task and a more pronounced 10.00 Hz peak at rest, whereas older adults showed the opposite pattern. Time-frequency analysis revealed age- and condition-dependent desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands (7.10-22.90 Hz). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the adapted FREQ-NESS pipeline for event-related tasks and highlight the importance of frequency-resolved network analysis for characterizing age-related changes in active auditory memory processing.

">Converting Spectral Evoked-to-Background Ratio intoTime-Domain Signal-to-Noise Ratio - Validation for HighFrequency Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                N-Interval Fourier Transform Analysis (N-FTA) allows for spectral separation of an evoked target signal from uncorrelated background activity. It computes the frequencydependent evoked-to-background ratio (EBR). The developed method allows for conversion of the spectral EBR into expected values for improvement of signal-to-noise ratio with progressing sweep count. Our study presents the mathematical basis for this conversion along with a validation for simulated and recorded data. The major findings are: Three factors enter the calculus of the expected SNR: the ratio of durations of the single sweep cycle and the evoked response window, the mean EBR in the spectral target band, and the sweep count. By conversion of all factors to dB, the expected SNR is defined by their sum. The two fundamental theories governing the improvement of SNR with increasing sweep count, the law of large numbers and the uncertainty principle of signal processing, deliver identical results. Conversion of EBR to expected SNR was successfully validated by simulated and recorded data and can be applied to all types of evoked data.

">Reading specific memories from human neurons before and after sleep</a></h4>

              
                The ability to retrieve a single episode encountered just once is a hallmark of human intelligence and episodic memory [1]. Yet, decoding a specific memory from neuronal activity in the human brain remains a formidable challenge. Here, we develop a transformer neural network model [2, 3] trained on neuronal spikes from intracranial microelectrodes recorded during a single viewing of an audiovisual episode. Combining spikes throughout the brain via cross-channel attention [4], capable of discovering neural patterns spread across brain regions and timescales, individual participant models predict memory retrieval of specific concepts such as persons or places. Brain regions differentially contribute to memory decoding before and after sleep. Models trained using only medial temporal lobe (MTL) spikes significantly decode concepts before but not after sleep, while models trained using only frontal cortex (FC) spikes decode concepts after but not before sleep. These findings suggest a system-wide distribution of information across neural populations that transforms over wake/sleep cycles [5]. Such decoding of internally generated memories suggests a path towards brain-computer interfaces to treat episodic memory disorders through enhancement or muting of specific memories.

">Attention robustly dissociates objective performance and subjective visibility reports</a></h4>

              
                Attention generally enhances both visual performance and subjective appearance. Yet, at matched performance, unattended items can appear more visible than attended ones, a phenomenon called "subjective inflation." Inflation, however, has only been narrowly tested near detection thresholds, making it unclear whether attention regularly dissociates objective and subjective aspects of perception with broad implications for everyday vision--where attention is usually unevenly distributed--and for studies of consciousness. Here, in four experiments, we tested inattentional inflation over varied stimulus and task conditions, spanning threshold to suprathreshold regimes. Using a new analytic approach to relate objective and subjective reports over full psychometric functions, we measured subjective inflation over wide ranges of matched performance. In all experiments, inattention inflated subjective stimulus visibility. But when subjective reports specified visibility of the task-relevant feature, we only found evidence for inflation at threshold. Thus, what we think we see may regularly dissociate from what we can visually discriminate.

">Motor Planning Sensitivity to Affective Looming Sounds Within The Peri-personal Space: An Interplay of Exogenous and Endogenous Influences</a></h4>

              
                Our brain maps the space immediately surrounding the body, the peripersonal space (PPS), to sharpen sensory-motor coordination whenever an object enters it. Within PPS, past research demonstrated how several factors influence motor readiness: from exogenous factors, such as body-object distance and stimulus semantics, to endogenous traits like personality traits. Nevertheless, most paradigms rely on vision or touch, relegating hearing to a supporting role and leaving auditory-only contributions unclear. Here, we tested whether affective content and individual traits modulate motor planning for looming sounds that stop within PPS. Thirty-three adults completed three auditory-only tasks in which positive, negative, or neutral sounds halted at five simulated distances from the participant's ears (0.3-0.7 m). We recorded anticipatory postural adjustments, distance estimates, affective ratings, and sensory suggestibility via a questionnaire. Motor responses were largely anticipated as sounds stopped nearer the body, while delayed and less precise for semantic (positive or negative) than neutral sounds. Higher suggestibility predicted longer and more variable premotor latencies, particularly for non-semantic sounds. These findings show that auditory cues alone engage flexible sensorimotor mechanisms within PPS, where exogenous (distance, semantics) and endogenous (suggestibility) factors jointly shape motor readiness and spatial perception.

">Denoising 7T Structural MRI with Conditional Generative Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                7T MRI offers ultra-high resolution and improved sensitivity for iron deposition in neurodegenerative disorders, but commonly used acquisitions are long and hence challenging, especially for elderly subjects. Efficiently denoising a short acquisition to achieve the image quality of a longer acquisition would be of translational benefit. We introduce a conditional diffusion model derived from generative AI (a 7T Conditional Diffusion Model, 7TCDM) that was trained on native single-acquisition 2D reconstructions and referenced multi-repetition images to guide the denoising process and improve SNR and contrast. 7TCDM model was tested on 2D T2-weighted gradient-echo imaging from 19 participants, including healthy controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD). 7TCDM's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and comprehensive reader studies. Referencing the multi-repetition ground truth, 7TCDM improved the single-acquisition original image by 29.1% in MSE, 5.8% in PSNR, and 9.4% in SSIM, and outperformed convolutional neural network-based models in all metrics. Expert rater evaluations confirmed superior image quality, with significantly enhanced detail and contrast preservation in regions such as the hippocampi, white matter lesions, and small cortical veins. The model also demonstrated robust performance in both the concurrently acquired and publicly available 3D multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions, which the model was not trained on. The 7T Conditional Diffusion Model provides high-quality denoised images from shorter scans, increasing the feasibility of scanning patients in shorter times while preserving essential anatomical and pathological details.

">Hypermyelination Improves Strength and Detection of Neuronal Activity in the CA1 Hippocampus and Facilitates Neuroprotection in FusOLcKO Mice</a></h4>

              
                Loss of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelin impairs cortical neuronal firing and network stability, whereas enhancement of oligodendrogenesis improves electrophysiological stability in cortex and, to a lesser extent, hippocampus. OLs exhibit regional heterogeneity, especially in their ability to synthesize cholesterol, a critical driver of myelin wrapping and ensheathment of axons. Conditional depletion of the Fused in sarcoma (Fus) gene in OLs, referred to as FusOLcKO, increases cholesterol biosynthesis, myelin thickness, and tissue cholesterol content. We examine whether this hypermyelination alters extracellular recordings across the layers of visual cortex and the underlying hippocampal CA1 over 16 weeks. In FusOLcKO mice, visually-evoked single-unit detectability and firing rate in CA1 increased relative to wild-type littermates, whereas cortical recordings showed no improvement. At the population level, FusOLcKO cortex exhibited reduced firing rates and lower functional connectivity, indicating altered network dynamics. Post-mortem histology revealed higher neuron density in recorded cortex and greater excitatory synapse density in CA1 of FusOLcKO mice suggesting region-specific neuroprotection and synaptic strengthening. These results demonstrate that cholesterol-driven hypermyelination enhances chronic hippocampal recordings while disrupting cortical network communication. Our study highlights myelin s region-dependent roles in supporting single-cell reliability, tuning population dynamics, and maintaining circuit integrity under chronic perturbation.

">Perception of first and second pain during offset analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Offset analgesia (OA) is defined as a disproportionate reduction in pain perception following a small decrease in noxious stimulation. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, with ongoing debate on peripheral versus central contributions. Objectives: This experimental study aimed to differentiate first and second pain perception during the OA paradigm, thereby assessing fiber-specific influences on OA. Methods: Thirty-two healthy participants were asked to distinguish a double pain sensation (first and second pain), to assess pain quality descriptors related to A-delta; and C-fibers, and to indicate response times to brief noxious heat stimuli. This procedure was repeated while implementing heat pulses in an OA paradigm. Results: No significant differences were found between offset and constant trials in the reported double pain sensation or the fiber specific pain descriptors (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, significant differences in response times were observed depending on the type of trial and the timing of the stimulus. Response time to noxious stimuli was delayed after prolonged stimulation in both offset and constant trials (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings suggest that A-delta and C-fiber response characteristics were unaffected during the OA paradigm; however, higher stimulation intensities or prolonged pain induce a notable response delay. This indicates a negligible role of specific peripheral nerve fibers in OA, emphasizing the predominance of central mechanisms, particularly those related to attention and cognitive resources, which merit further investigation.

">Stress-induced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a blood biomarker and brain risk factor for PTSD</a></h4>

              
                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe stress-related psychiatric condition triggered by traumatic life-threatening events, characterized notably by an altered memory profile. Although clinically well-documented, no specific biomarker exists. This translational study identifies plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a brain risk factor for PTSD, thereby supporting its potential as a blood-derived biomarker. Mice with genetically ablated PAI-1 were protected from developing a PTSD-like memory profile. Conversely, mice exhibiting PTSD-like cognitive impairment showed increased blood PAI-1 levels, correlating with their profile severity. In the brain, PAI-1 levels were specifically increased in the dorsal hippocampus, a key region for cognitive functions and in the etiology of PTSD. Finally, a longitudinal study of soldiers revealed that those developing PTSD symptoms exhibit rising blood PAI-1 levels over a 12-month period. Its significant association with various indicators of PTSD-related psychological distress attests to PAI-1's potential as a blood biomarker and brain therapeutic target for PTSD.

">Complementary Structural and Chemical Biology Methods Reveal the Basis for Selective Radioligand Binding to α-Synuclein in MSA Tissue</a></h4>

              
                Fibrillar aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders, including multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Despite advances in aSyn fibril structural characterization, the relevance of in vitro and ex vivo structures to patient aggregates remains unclear, particularly for developing therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of aSyn fibrils with ligands often reveal binding at multiple sites, likely due to high ligand concentrations. Here, various structural and chemical biology techniques were used to characterize aSyn fibrils in the presence of EX-6, a candidate ligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synucleinopathies. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-EM revealed no significant fibril core changes upon binding. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) further demonstrated that the disordered C-terminus was unaltered. Cryo-EM and crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) identified consistent binding sites, with one (Site 2*) providing a well-defined pocket for high-resolution analysis. Site 2* showed similar residue positioning in MSA patient-derived structures, suggesting MSA selectivity. [3H]-EX-6 binding assays demonstrated a 10-fold preference for MSA over PD tissue, with autoradiography further confirming MSA selectivity. Taken together, the combined use of structural and chemical biology techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of EX-6 binding that would not be possible with any single method. Optimization of ligand-protein and ligand-ligand interactions observed in the cryo-EM structure will enable the development of EX-6 as a PET imaging probe for MSA.

">Feature Misbinding Underlying Serial-Order Effects of Visuospatial Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                The accurate processing of incoming visual information in serial order is fundamental to visual cognition. Prior studies have demonstrated primacy and recency effects in tasks requiring the serial recall of visual stimuli such as letters, digits, words, or locations. However, there is still ongoing debate about whether these primacy/recency effects on working memory retrieval reflect variable representational precision for multiple items in memory or misbinding of item features (e.g., location) and their ordinal position. This study sought to examine potential sources contributing to serial-position effects in visuospatial working memory using eye tracking and statistical modeling approaches. In two eye-tracking experiments, we measured the latency and endpoint error of serial-order memory-guided saccades under varying cue conditions (order cue vs. quadrant cue) from a total of 92 participants. The first memory-guided saccade (MGS) showed primacy and recency effects on endpoint error, latency, and transposition error in the order cue condition but not in the quadrant cue condition. Probabilistic modeling of MGS distribution showed a better fit of a standard (non-swapping) model to the quadrant-cue condition and a swap model to the order-cue condition. These findings indicate that visuospatial working memory representation varies across serial positions primarily due to location-serial-position misbinding rather than variable memory precision about location.

">The chloride cotransporter NKCC1 regulates self-renewal of hippocampal neural stem cells via the transcription factor Sox11</a></h4>

              
                The GABAergic-mediated depolarization plays a key role in controlling stem cell fate and neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. This depolarization effect is highly dependent on the balance between the chloride co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. It is not known how changes in NKCC1 modulate the fate of Nestin-positive stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus during adult neurogenesis. In our study, we demonstrate that a knockout of Nkcc1 in NSCs increase their proliferation by symmetric self-renewal and expand the stem cell pool. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified Sox11 as a key transcription factor that is significantly downregulated following Nkcc1 knockout. In agreement with this finding, we found that Sox11 knockout enhances proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs, which is also marked by an increase in symmetric stem cell division. Based on these findings, we propose that altering Nkcc1 expression in NSCs shifts their fate from neurogenesis towards self-renewal via Sox11 regulation. Furthermore, we observed that NKCC1 levels decline in NSCs during aging, which correlates with a further increase in self-renewal. Our data strongly suggest that the age-related decline in NKCC1 levels promote symmetric division and self-renewal contributing to the age-dependent decrease in neurogenesis. NKCC1 via Sox11 is a key regulator of NSCs fate decision, critically balancing self-renewal and neuronal differentiation in the adult hippocampus.

">In pursuit of saccade awareness: Limited control and minimal conscious access to catch-up saccades during smooth pursuit eye movements.</a></h4>

              
                Observers use smooth pursuit to track moving objects--like koi carp gliding through a pond. When positional errors accumulate, rapid catch-up saccades correct for them. Despite their abruptness, these saccades usually go unnoticed, creating the seamless experience of smooth tracking. We conducted three experiments to examine awareness and control of catch-up saccades (Experiment 1), the effect of training (Experiment 2), and of movement intention (Experiment 3). All experiments followed a similar protocol. On each trial, a target moved horizontally at one of three constant speeds (3-12 dva/s). Two horizontal stimulus bands with vertically oriented gratings appeared above and below the trajectory. These bands were rendered invisible during pursuit by rapid phase shifts (>60 Hz), but became visible when briefly stabilized on the retina--either by a catch-up saccade or its replayed retinal consequence--providing immediate, saccade-contingent visual feedback. Observers reported whether they had seen the stimulus bands (visual sensitivity) and whether they were aware of making a catch-up saccade (saccade sensitivity). Visual sensitivity was consistently higher in trials with a catch-up saccade, confirming that these movements reduce retinal motion and enhance visibility. Higher target speeds increased saccade rate, but observers struggled to control them consciously: Visual feedback and training had no effect on the ability to control catch-up saccades. Only suppression-instructions yielded a small reduction. Saccade sensitivity was near zero, even in trials with saccade-contingent feedback. Neither training nor intention improved awareness. Together, our data suggest a limited ability to control and a low level of sensorimotor awareness of catch-up saccades during pursuit.

                Well-coordinated brain activity is a crucial driver of bodily functions and is refined by environmental input. Understanding the structure of brain areas that regulate various functions and how the environment affects the neural responses in the brain has been fundamental in advancing the field of neuroscience and medicine. The Golgi-Cox method is a histological approach that has allowed researchers to view neuronal structures with unmatched and detailed resolution, allowing for the comparison between non-diseased and diseased models, for instance. However, this method is known to stain neurons sparsely, which is useful for distinguishing structural components, but unpredictably, which is difficult for reproducibility and targeted studies. Here, we use three approaches to demonstrate a predictable pattern of cell staining using the Golgi-Cox method. We show that neuronal maturity, time of day, and response to environmental stimuli affect the number of cells stained by the Golgi-Cox method. Furthermore, we found low variability within each experimental group, which indicates staining reproducibility under controlled environments. Our study highlights important parameters for using the Golgi-Cox method and demonstrates its feasibility for broader application in answering neuroscience-based questions.

">Anticipatory modulation as a unifying principle of sensory coding during locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion modulates the activity of sensory systems in multiple ways: from gain changes in individual neurons to changing interactions in neural populations. These effects are not universal; while movement has a strong influence on sensory coding in rodents, its impact on primates is less prominent. The diversity of effects that locomotion exerts on sensory neurons, as well as disparities between species, raises questions about the existence of universal principles that may underlie sensation during behavior. We propose that sensory systems are modulated in anticipation of systematic changes in stimulus statistics caused by locomotion to maintain an accurate and efficient sensory code across behavioral states. Model neurons optimized to encode stimuli recorded during movement in natural environments predict and reproduce a broad spectrum of experimental observations. The proposed, simple principle of anticipatory modulation reconciles the diversity of ways in which locomotion modulates visual coding in different animal species.

">High frequency electrical stimulation entrains fast spiking interneurons and bidirectionally modulates information processing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Clinical intracranial electrical stimulation often deploys trains of high frequency pulses. While brief bursts of stimulation are known to heterogeneously modulate neuronal spiking, it is unclear how trains of high frequency pulses influence neural dynamics. Objective: As fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) can support rapid firing, we seek to determine how high frequency stimulation modulates FSIs. Methods: We characterized the real-time effect of one-second-long local stimulation at 40 versus 140 Hz on parvalbumin positive interneurons, known as FSIs, in motor and visual cortices in awake mice using near kilohertz voltage imaging, free of electrical stimulation artifact. Results: Stimulation at 140 Hz, like 40 Hz, heterogeneously modulates individual FSIs membrane voltage in both cortices, leading to complex temporal dynamics. FSIs in both cortices are robustly entrained by 40 Hz stimulation, even though 40 Hz led to prominent membrane hyperpolarization in visual cortex but not motor cortex. Intriguingly, visual cortical FSIs, but not motor cortical ones, were reliably entrained by 140 Hz stimulation. Finally, while stimulation consistently reduced the response amplitude of visual cortical FSIs to visual flickers, response temporal precision is bidirectionally modulated. Conclusion: High frequency electrical stimulation mediates brain-region specific entrainment of FSIs, and bidirectionally modulates FSI temporal processing of synaptic inputs. Thus, high frequency stimulation can differentially engage inhibitory neurons in different brain regions to modulate network information processing.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Individuals with cerebral visual impairment (CVI) often demonstrate difficulties with visual selective attention; however, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether structural and functional connectivity between and within the attention networks, thalamus, and early visual areas is differentially associated with performance on a conjunction search task in participants with CVI as compared to controls. Data from 26 participants was collected and analyzed (10 CVI, four female, 17.4 years, 5.38 s.d., 16 control, 10 female, 22.25 years, 4.25 s.d.). White matter tracts associated with the dorsal and ventral attention networks as well as structural and functional connectivity matrices of the dorsal and ventral attention networks were generated for each participant. Group differences in conjunction search outcomes, tract volume, and network connectivity strength were evaluated. General linear models were used to investigate the relationship between neuroimaging predictor variables and each of the four conjunction search primary outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for age and verbal cognition. In the CVI group impaired visual search was associated with weaker structural and stronger functional connectivity, while in the control group the opposite effect was observed. Together, these results suggest that functional over-recruitment may be a maladaptive compensatory mechanism.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Agreement and disagreement are essential brain processes that enable effective communication and decision-making. However, a clear neurophysiological framework explaining their organization is still lacking. The present study aimed to identify EEG correlates of implicit agreement and disagreement, developing a novel experimental paradigm to model these internal responses. Participants were tasked with mentally responding to binary (“yes” or “no”) questions and evaluating the accuracy of a computer system’s attempts to “guess” their responses. Event-related potentials (ERP) revealed distinct patterns associated with agreement and disagreement in two key contexts: when participants read the final word of a question and when they observed the computer’s “guess.” Disagreement, compared to agreement, elicited larger ERP amplitudes, specifically an enhanced N400 component in the first context and increased feedback-related negativity in the second. Considering the associations of these ERP components with cognitive processes, this research offers robust evidence linking agreement and disagreement to the brain’s effort in reconciling personal beliefs and expectations with new information. Furthermore, the experimental framework and findings provide a foundation for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) capable of detecting “yes” and “no” commands based on their intrinsic EEG predictors, offering promising applications in assistive technologies and neural communication systems.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to proficiently play a musical instrument requires a fine-grained synchronization between several sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes functional changes with musical training, identifiable also in resting-state data. These studies analyzed functional MRI or electrophysiological frequency-specific brain networks in isolation. While the analysis of such “mono-layer” networks has proven useful, it fails to capture the complexities of multiple interacting networks. To this end, we applied a multilayer network framework for analyzing publicly available data (Open MEG Archive) obtained with magnetoencephalography. We investigated resting-state differences between participants with musical training (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31) and those without (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31). While single-layer analysis did not demonstrate any group differences, multilayer analysis revealed that musicians show a modular organization that spans visuo-motor and fronto-temporal areas, known to be involved in musical performance execution, which is significantly different from non-musicians. Differences between the two groups are primarily observed in the theta (6.5 to 8 Hz), alpha1 (8.5 to 10 Hz), and beta1 (12.5 to 16 Hz) frequency bands. We demonstrate that the multilayer method provides additional information that single-layer analysis cannot. Overall, the multilayer network method provides a unique opportunity to explore the pan-spectral nature of oscillatory networks, with studies of brain plasticity as a potential future application.</span>

                <p>We have documented the early embryonic development of hypothalamic neurons expressing &beta;-endorphin, &alpha;-melanocyte&ndash;stimulating hormone, neuropeptide Y, and kisspeptin in rhesus macaques, an animal model that is very similar to humans. Neurons expressing both &beta;-End and &alpha;MSH are the first to develop and are initially located in the lateral basal hypothalamus (LBH) as early as day 32&ndash;34 of gestation. By day 45 of gestation, these neurons have migrated into the medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) area as their final destination. NPY neurons within the ARH develop later and first appear at day 44 of fetal life, at which time a cluster of neurons is present within the ARH&ndash;MBH area. NPY neurons continue to be expressed within the ARH area at all of the later fetal ages analyzed. Similarly, kisspeptin neurons develop later compared with &beta;-End, although only a few cells are present in the ARH by day 44 of gestation, at which time kisspeptin is also expressed in the developing anterior lobe of the pituitary. By day 70 of gestation, the rostral to caudal distribution and cell size of Kiss1 neurons within the MBH are similar in females and males. In addition, Kiss1 fibers are also expressed in the POA by day 70. By day 130 of gestation, Kiss1 neurons exhibit a wider dorsal and lateral distribution within the MBH, with highly increased fiber distribution. Therefore, the development of these neurons is much earlier than what had been described previously for &alpha;MSH and NPY in primates.</p>

                Background Early and accurate prediction of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is essential for reducing mortality and enabling timely intervention. Misdiagnosis can lead to severe health outcomes, emphasizing the need for robust and intelligent predictive models. Deep learning approaches have shown strong potential in identifying hidden patterns in medical data and aiding clinical decision-making. Methods This study proposes a novel Hybrid Residual Attention with Echo State Network (HRAESN) model that integrates Attention Residual Learning (ARL) with Echo State Networks (ESN) to enhance feature extraction and temporal data learning. The hybrid model is designed to refine feature attention through residual learning while leveraging ESN for efficient time-series prediction. Two publicly available benchmark datasets were used for evaluation: the Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset comprising 70,000 instances and the UCI Heart Disease dataset containing 303 instances. Missing values in both datasets were handled using a multiple imputation technique tailored for ischemic heart disease. Model performance was assessed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F-measure. Results The proposed HRAESN model demonstrated superior classification performance compared to traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. It achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on the Kaggle dataset and 97.7% on the UCI dataset. Additionally, the model showed high sensitivity and specificity, indicating strong diagnostic capability and reliability in identifying both diseased and non-diseased cases. Conclusions The HRAESN model effectively combines the strengths of residual attention mechanisms and echo state networks, resulting in improved accuracy and stability for ischemic heart disease prediction. Its strong performance on benchmark datasets confirms its potential as a valuable clinical decision support tool for early detection of IHD. Future work may focus on optimizing model complexity and integrating real-time medical IoT data to enhance practical deployment in healthcare systems.

                Background Complications during the puerperium present abnormal conditions that can jeopardize the health and well-being of both mother and newborn. These complications are significant contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the factors associated with postpartum disease complications. Methods This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251013692). A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases, including Scopus and PubMed, to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. Eligible studies included full-text, peer-reviewed articles that used quantitative or qualitative designs and addressed postpartum complications in accordance with the PEO framework. Descriptive analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results A total of 907 records were identified, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings highlight a range of factors significantly associated with postpartum complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, maternal age >35 years, depressive and anxiety disorders, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, type of vaginal delivery, infant-related health concerns, childhood trauma, low social support, low educational attainment of both mothers and husbands, perceived social isolation, and marital dissatisfaction. While early detection and intervention were not directly evaluated in these studies, the identification of these risk factors suggests that targeted screening and supportive strategies may be beneficial in mitigating postpartum complications. Conclusions This review identifies multiple psychosocial, demographic, and clinical factors associated with postpartum complications. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and comprehensive postpartum care to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.

                Abstract* Introduction Bilateral medial medullary infarction (BMMI) is a rare ischemic lesion that typically presents as dysarthria, dysphagia, tetraplegia, and respiratory failure. It is known for its characteristic « heart-shaped » appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The etiological profile of this disease has not been studied previously. Considering the unfavorable outcome of BMMI, it is crucial to investigate the clinical and etiological profile to optimize the management of these patients. Case presentation A 49-year-old north-african smoker male patient was admitted to the neurology department of the military hospital of Tunis-Tunisia 24 hours after acute-onset slurred speech, weakness and impaired sensation in all four limbs, predominantly in the lower limb. His family history was remarkable for young-onset brainstem ischemic stroke (IS) in a brother. Neurological examination a right hemiparesis with tactile hemihypoesthesia and right astereognosia (modified Rankin scale of 2). Cerebral MRI showed radiological aspect compatible with diagnosis of « heart-shaped » BMMI. A heterozygous mutation R506 of Leiden Factor V was identified. The patient’s condition remained stable at 15 months follow-up (Modified Rankins Scale at 2) and no recurrence of IS was noted under anticoagulation to date. Conclusions BMMI is a rare case of medial medullary infarction, accounting for less than 1% of IS cases. To our knowledge, this is the first case of « heart-shaped » BMMI linked to Leiden Factor V mutation.

                Abstract* Background The digital age has brought numerous technological advances that have transformed our way of living and relating. Among them, Social media have revolutionized how we communicate and share information. However, there is a silent danger behind this seemingly harmless tool: Social media addiction. For this reason, the objective of this re-search was to determine if emotional intelligence and self-esteem predict addiction to Social media in Peruvian university students. Methods Therefore, a cross-sectional predictive design study was developed, in which 289 Peruvian university students participated voluntarily, whose ages fluctuated between 23.61 years with a standard deviation of 5.88 years, of which 54.06% were female and 45.94% were male. In addition, to measure the variables, the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale – EAR, and the Social media addiction questionnaire (ARS) were used. Results Linear regression results show that self-esteem (SELF) is the strongest predictor across all models, with beta coefficients of -0.293 for Social Media Obsession (SMO), -0.225 for Lack of Control, and -0.153 (LAU) for Excessive Social Media Use (USO). Regarding the emotional intelligence dimensions, it is observed that Appraisal of Own Emo-tions (SEA) and Use of Own Emotions (UEO) have weak negative effects on SMO addiction, with beta coefficients ranging from -0.072 to -0.136. Conclusions It is concluded that the models explain 17.2% of the variance in SMO, 14.8% in LAU, and 9.2% in USO. These values suggest that, while self-esteem and emotional intelligence influence SMO addiction, other additional factors may also play an important role.

                <p>by Boyu Jiang, Nick Quinn-Bohmann, Christian Diener, Vignesh Bose Nathan, Yu Han-Hallett, Lavanya Reddivari, Sean M. Gibbons, Priyanka Baloni</p>

The colonic epithelium plays a key role in the host-microbiome interactions, allowing uptake of various nutrients and driving important metabolic processes. To unravel detailed metabolic activities in the human colonic epithelium, our present study focuses on the generation of the first cell-type specific genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of human colonic epithelial cells, named iColonEpithelium. GEMs are powerful tools for exploring reactions and metabolites at the systems level and predicting the flux distributions at steady state. Our cell-type-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic reconstruction captures genes specifically expressed in the human colonic epithelial cells. iColonEpithelium is also capable of performing metabolic tasks specific to the colonic epithelium. A unique transport reaction compartment has been included to allow for the simulation of metabolic interactions with the gut microbiome. We used iColonEpithelium to identify metabolic signatures associated with inflammatory bowel disease. We used single-cell RNA sequencing data from Crohn’s Diseases (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) samples to build disease-specific iColonEpithelium metabolic networks in order to predict metabolic signatures of colonocytes in both healthy and disease states. We identified reactions in nucleotide interconversion, fatty acid synthesis and tryptophan metabolism were differentially regulated in CD and UC conditions, relative to healthy control, which were in accordance with experimental results. The iColonEpithelium metabolic network can be used to identify mechanisms at the cellular level, and we show an initial proof-of-concept for how our tool can be leveraged to explore the metabolic interactions between host and gut microbiota.

Ecological communities globally are shifting to degraded states, motivating research into attributes supporting resilience or leading to alternative stable states. Coral reef communities are particularly vulnerable as they are facing myriad anthropogenic impacts that contribute to shifts away from coral dominance, motivating much research on whether these shifts are gradual and reversible transitions versus alternative stable states. Empirical studies demonstrate functionally-diverse herbivorous fish communities support coral reef resilience to anthropogenic impacts. However, few coral reef models incorporate herbivore and algal functional groups and quantify their effects on reef resilience and alternative stable states. We built a coral reef model that includes herbivorous fish functional groups and their algal targets and explored how this expansion affects predictions of resilience and alternative stable states under different scenarios of human impacts. We found evenness across the functional groups of herbivores is increasingly important for reef recovery as fishing pressure increases, and recovery is promoted when algal communities begin with more turf than macroalgae. Our findings also highlight that models omitting functional groups that comprise real communities will miss crucial phenomena, such as loss of alternative stable states for browser-dominated communities, or continued presence of alternative stable states in grazer-dominated communities even when fishing pressure is removed entirely. This work advances our ability to understand and predict coral reef resilience and alternative stable states in the Anthropocene, and provides guidance for conservation policy on fishing practices.

Nucleotide recoding RNA sequencing methods (NR-seq; TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.) are powerful approaches for assaying transcript population dynamics. In addition, these methods have been extended to probe a host of regulated steps in the RNA life cycle. Current bioinformatic tools significantly constrain analyses of NR-seq data. To address this limitation, we developed EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/EZbakR), an R package to facilitate a more comprehensive set of NR-seq analyses, and fastq2EZbakR (https://github.com/isaacvock/fastq2EZbakR), a Snakemake pipeline for flexible preprocessing of NR-seq datasets, collectively referred to as the EZbakR suite. Together, these tools generalize many aspects of the NR-seq analysis workflow. The fastq2EZbakR pipeline can assign reads to a diverse set of genomic features (e.g., genes, exons, splice junctions), and EZbakR can perform analyses on any combination of these features. EZbakR extends standard NR-seq mutational modeling to support multi-label analyses (e.g., s<sup>4</sup>U and s<sup>6</sup>G dual labeling), and implements an improved hierarchical model to better account for transcript-to-transcript variance in metabolic label incorporation. EZbakR also generalizes dynamical systems modeling of NR-seq data to support analyses of premature mRNA processing and flow between subcellular compartments. Finally, EZbakR implements flexible and well-powered comparative analyses of all estimated parameters via design matrix-specified generalized linear modeling. The EZbakR suite will thus allow researchers to make full, effective use of NR-seq data.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) significantly affects morbidity and mortality rates. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) play a crucial role in managing AF but often exhibit gender-specific complications. Our study aims to identify gender-specific Class III AADs by integrating in vitro measurements, in silico models, and machine learning (ML). By simulating drug effects on a diverse cardiomyocyte model population (5,663 males and 6,184 females), we classified drugs based on changes in action potentials and calcium transients. Using sex-dependent Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, we achieved high prediction accuracy (>89%) and F1 score (>87%). Key features included changes in resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude, duration and area. Gender differences in drug responses were attributed to lower IK1, INa, and Ito in females.

                <p>by Paul Züge, Natalie Schieferstein, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer</p>

A hallmark of biological and artificial neural networks is that neurons tile the range of continuous sensory inputs and intrinsic variables with overlapping responses. It is characteristic for the underlying recurrent connectivity in the cortex that neurons with similar tuning predominantly excite each other. The reason for such an architecture is not clear. Using an analytically tractable model as well as spiking neural networks, we show that it can naturally arise from a cooperative coding scheme. In this scheme neurons with similar responses specifically support each other by sharing their computations to obtain the desired population code. This sharing allows each neuron to effectively respond to a broad variety of inputs, while only receiving few feedforward and recurrent connections. Few strong, specific recurrent connections then replace many feedforward and less specific recurrent connections, such that the resulting connectivity optimizes the number of required synapses. This suggests that the number of required synapses may be a crucial constraining factor in biological neural networks. Synaptic savings increase with the dimensionality of the encoded variables. We find a trade-off between saving synapses and response speed. The response speed improves by orders of magnitude when utilizing the window of opportunity between excitatory and delayed inhibitory currents that arises if, as found in experiments, spike frequency adaptation is present or strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong, shortly-lagged inhibition.

Glycosphingolipids (GSL) are important bioactive membrane components. GSLs containing sialic acids, known as gangliosides, are highly abundant in the brain and diseases of ganglioside metabolism cause severe early-onset neurodegeneration. The ganglioside GM2 is processed by β-hexosaminidase A and when non-functional GM2 accumulates causing Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff diseases. We have developed i3Neuron-based disease models demonstrating storage of GM2 and severe endolysosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the plasma membrane (PM) is significantly altered in its lipid and protein composition. These changes are driven in part by lysosomal exocytosis causing inappropriate accumulation of lysosomal proteins on the cell surface. There are also significant changes in synaptic protein abundances with direct functional impact on neuronal activity. Lysosomal proteins are also enriched at the PM in GM1 gangliosidosis supporting that lysosomal exocytosis is a conserved mechanism of PM proteome change in these diseases. This work provides mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunction in gangliosidoses highlighting that these are severe PM disorders with implications for other lysosomal and neurodegenerative diseases.

                <p>by Hyunwoo Kim, Joon-Goon Kim, Jueun Sim, Hoyeon Nam, In Cho, Hyejin Shin, Junyoung Kwon, Dae-Hyeon Song, Seoungbin Bae, Young-Gyu Yoon, Taeyun Ku, Jae-Byum Chang</p>

Multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels has been extensively studied to visualize numerous biomolecules at a nanoscale resolution in situ. Previous studies have employed sparse labels, such as DAPI or lectin staining, as registration markers. However, these sparse labels do not adequately capture the full extent of deformation across the entire region of interest. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of dense labels, specifically fluorophore <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester staining, as registration markers to achieve highly accurate image registration. We first tested several NHS-functionalized fluorophores as fiducial markers and identified the proper candidates for three-dimensional (3D) multiplexed cyclic imaging. We analyzed the registration accuracy between DAPI and NHS-ester staining and illustrated that dense label-based registration provides a more accurate registration performance. In the multiplexed imaging of expanded specimens, we observed that repetitive expansion/shrinking processes and chemical treatments for signal elimination can induce 3D nonlinear distortion. This sample distortion can be mitigated by re-embedding the tissue gel or replacing the chemical de-staining process with photobleaching-based signal removal or computational signal unmixing. With such an optimized experimental setup, we demonstrated 3D multiplexed cyclic imaging with nanoscale precision image registration. Finally, we prove that dense biological structures, such as actin, can be used as registration markers to achieve high registration accuracy. We anticipate that the proposed dense labeling strategy will overcome the technical limitations of multiplexed cyclic imaging in expandable tissue gels, offering high-precision registration. We expect it to be widely adopted by the biological and medical communities.

                <p>by Sumedha Ravishankar, Samantha M. Tuohey, Nicole O. Ramos, Satoshi Uchiyama, Megan I. Hayes, Kalisa Kang, Victor Nizet, Cressida A. Madigan</p>

To cause meningitis, bacteria move from the bloodstream to the brain, crossing the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier. Most studies on how bacteria cross the blood–brain barrier have been performed in vitro using cultured endothelial cells, due to a paucity of animal models. Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and is primarily thought to cross the blood–brain barrier by transcytosis through endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis <i>in vivo</i>, we used optically transparent zebrafish larvae. Time-lapse confocal microscopy revealed that GBS forms extracellular microcolonies in brain blood vessels and causes perforation and lysis of blood–brain barrier endothelial cells, which promotes bacterial entry into the brain. Vessels infected with GBS microcolonies were distorted and contained thrombi. Inhibition of clotting worsened brain invasion, suggesting a host-protective role for thrombi. The GBS lysin cylE, implicated in brain invasion <i>in vitro</i>, was found dispensable <i>in vivo</i>. Instead, pro-inflammatory mediators associated with endothelial cell damage and blood–brain barrier breakdown were specifically upregulated in the zebrafish head upon GBS entry into the brain. Therefore, GBS crosses the blood–brain barrier <i>in vivo</i> not by transcytosis, but by endothelial cell lysis and death. Given that we observe the same invasion route for a meningitis-associated strain of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, our findings suggest that streptococcal infection of brain blood vessels triggers endothelial cell inflammation and lysis, thereby facilitating brain invasion.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mouse models of genetic dystonias have demonstrated abnormal striatal cholinergic interneuron excitability, but do not consistently demonstrate subjective dystonic features. To determine whether striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause potentially dystonic motor behaviors, we first determined features correlated specifically with dystonia severity in people and then determined whether these features emerged in mice following striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eight movement disorders experts rated dystonia severity in 193 videos of people with cerebral palsy doing a seated task. Leg adduction variability metrics, which are known to correlate with leg dystonia severity during gait, were quantified in these videos of seated tasks. Metrics significantly associated with leg dystonia severity during seated tasks in people were then quantified in mice and compared between mice who underwent chemogenetic striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation (n = 17) and mice who did not (n = 17).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Leg adduction variability correlated well with experts' leg dystonia severity scores in people. Leg adduction variability was also significantly increased in mice that underwent striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation compared to mice that did not (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). This difference was not present with acute excitation and emerged only after 14 days of ongoing excitation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that leg adduction variability correlates with leg dystonia severity in people with cerebral palsy and that chronic, but not acute, striatal cholinergic interneuron excitation can cause leg adduction variability in mice. These results support targeting striatal cholinergic interneurons for dystonia drug development and demonstrate the potential value of using quantifiable leg adduction metrics to study dystonia pathophysiology.

<p>The influence of P2X7R activation on the biological behavior of glioma and its potential value as a therapeutic target for glioma.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, characterized by high invasiveness and poor prognosis. The purinergic ligand-gated ion channel 7 receptor (P2X7R), an ion channel-type purinergic receptor with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as its ligand, is widely expressed in various tumor cells, including glioma. Moreover, it plays crucial biological functions in the progression of glioma. P2X7R promotes the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of glioma by activating multiple signaling pathways, facilitating epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioma. However, the activation of P2X7R by high concentrations of ATP can induce cell necrosis or pyroptosis, exerting an anti-glioma effect. The bidirectional nature of its functions may be related to differences in the subtypes of P2X7R, cell types, as well as the TME. P2X7R antagonists can inhibit its effect in glioma, while the expression of P2X7R can enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this review, the structure and function of P2X7R, its role in tumor, especially its mechanism of action in glioma, and its latent capacity value as a target for therapeutic of glioma were reviewed in detail.</p>

The supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBB) has been a frequently performed technique because it provides excellent quality of blockade, faster onset, and dense blockade. Different adjuvants and local anaesthetics are used to improve the onset and quality of the blockade. In our study, the local anaesthetic used was 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the adjuvants used were buprenorphine and nalbuphine. Materials and Methods Our study, a randomised, prospective double-blinded investigation, was conducted on 60 patients scheduled for elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries. We performed the Supraclavicular brachial plexus block with 25 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine plain (Group L) or with buprenorphine (Group LB) or with nalbuphine (Group LN) as adjuvants. We recorded the onset, duration of blockade (motor and sensory), sedation score, and time for rescue analgesia. Results The onset of sensorimotor blockade was notably faster in Group LB than in Group LN or Group L. The sensorimotor blockade duration was significantly prolonged in Group LB compared to LN and L. Group LB also had a delayed time after 12 hrs for rescue analgesia compared to the other two groups. Conclusion Buprenorphine as an adjuvant to 0.5% levobupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block significantly shortens the onset of sensorimotor blockade and enhances the duration of blockade when compared to nalbuphine. Both the adjuvants delayed the time for request of rescue analgesia compared to plain levobupivacaine.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-645/v1?src=rss">Technology Support Fraud Analysis for the Elderly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Older adults often fall victim to technology (tech) support fraud, with criminals leveraging on psychological manipulation and perceived authority to exploit victims. Often unfamiliar with evolving digital threats, they may be particularly susceptible due to cognitive aging, social isolation, and trust in perceived authoritative figures. Despite growing awareness of cyber fraud, there are insufficient tailored fraud preventive strategies that address the specific vulnerabilities of older victims. This study investigates how psychological manipulation tactics influence compliance and reporting behavior among elderly victims of tech support fraud, filling a critical gap in fraud prevention research. Method The authors conducted a literature search on Google’s scholar to identify research papers related to elderly fraud and tech support scams. In addition, using qualitative analysis, the authors analyzed tech support fraud cases sourced from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to identify recurring themes in victim experiences. Three dominant themes emerged: emotional manipulation, perceived authority, and barriers to reporting. Scammers exploit fear and legitimacy, posing as trusted entities to gain compliance. Results Findings reveal that financial loss, shame, and family support affect victims’ likelihood of reporting these incidents. Victims who do not suffer monetary harm often refrain from reporting due to shame, embarrassment, or skepticism about law enforcement response. Family involvement appears to positively influence reporting behavior, reinforcing the importance of social networks in fraud prevention. Conclusion This study underscores the urgent need for targeted education programs that equip elderly individuals to recognize fraud tactics and report incidents irrespective of financial impact. It calls for fraud prevention strategies that incorporate accessible training materials, social network engagement, and multi-channel awareness campaigns. Future research should incorporate diverse data sources to expand and refine these findings and explore intervention strategies that mitigate psychological barriers to report fraud among elderly victims.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-644/v1?src=rss">Implementation of didactic strategies for assurance of learning with students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Assurance of Learning is a process focused on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of education. It involves implementing practices, policies, and procedures intended to ensure the development of skills, competencies, and knowledge expected in a specific educational program or course. In the subjects Chemistry and General Chemistry I at the Universidad de La Sabana, persistent issues with low academic performance have resulted in rising course repetition rates, lack of motivation, and student dropout. Methods The present study examines targeted didactic strategies for students at risk of academic failure in these subjects, representing an innovation in the field of education and contributing to the domain of learning assurance in Chemistry. It was conducted under a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional design. A predictive trend analysis was carried out, and strategies were identified, selected, and implemented with consideration for students’ perceptions and assessments. Two samples were analyzed: a characterization sample of 411 students who took the subjects between the second semester of 2020 and the first semester of 2023, and an experimental sample comprising students from the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Results The results revealed that participation in the implemented strategies led to improved academic performance, particularly for students with lower Saber 11 scores. Strategy 1 (leveling course) showed the greatest positive impact, with statistically significant differences in performance. Moreover, students reported high satisfaction with the strategies, especially regarding their usefulness, engagement, and relevance. Conclusions These findings suggest that personalized and contextualized didactic strategies are effective in supporting students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry courses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-643/v1?src=rss">Vietnam's foreign policy (1945-1946): Proactive in a fragile independence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The August Revolution of 1945 established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but the nascent government immediately faced immense challenges from external forces like French colonialists and Chiang Kai-shek’s army, alongside internal difficulties. In this precarious situation, diplomacy emerged as a crucial strategic tool for the Vietnamese revolution during the 1945-1946 period, demonstrating a skillful blend of struggle and negotiation to safeguard independence. Methods This study is grounded in the principles of dialectical and historical materialism, consistent with the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The main methods include: the historical method (systematic examination of events and policies), the logical method (reconstructing diplomatic strategies), intertextual analysis (comparing Party directives with diplomatic actions), critical discourse analysis (Ho Chi Minh’s statements), and comparative assessment (with other decolonization movements). Data were collected from declassified archival materials, legal texts, diplomatic records, and contemporary press. Results During 1945-1946, Vietnam implemented an independent, self-reliant, and open foreign policy based on principles of equality and mutual assistance, with the core objective of protecting independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This policy demonstrated strategic flexibility by conciliating Chiang Kai-shek’s forces to free up resources against the French, and by signing the Preliminary Accord and Provisional Agreement with France to gain time for resistance preparation. Vietnamese diplomacy also proactively established friendly relations with neighboring countries and major powers, sought international recognition, and committed to multilateral cooperation, thereby strengthening the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. Conclusion In an extremely challenging situation, foreign affairs activities, under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, successfully protected Vietnam’s independence and enhanced the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s prestige. The strategic lessons on foreign policy thinking from 1945-1946 have become a firm foundation for Vietnam’s modern foreign policy. They emphasize the harmonious combination of national independence, socialism, genuine patriotism, and internationalism, striving towards the ultimate goal of building a “prosperous people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization” in Vietnam.

                Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when dealing with widespread metastatic disease.

<p>A detailed structural analysis of the juvenile swine ventricular–subventricular zone reveals four distinct cellular layers and diverse neuroblast migration routes, including pathways toward the olfactory bulb and cortical regions. These features underscore the swine brain's value as a translational model for studying postnatal neurogenesis in large-brained, gyrencephalic mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ), lining the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, is a major neurogenic region in the adult brain of many mammals. This study investigates the structural organization and cellular composition of the V-SVZ in the juvenile swine brain (3–5 months), providing novel insights into neuroblast migration in gyrencephalic species. Using immunohistochemistry combined with transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we redefined the cytoarchitecture of the swine V-SVZ, identifying four distinct cellular layers. Layer 1 consists of a pseudostratified epithelium of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive ependymal cells, whose cilia and microvilli extend into the ventricular lumen, frequently surrounding supraependymal axons. Beneath it, layer 2 is composed of astrocytic and radial glia processes and contains occasional clusters of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells with prominent microtubules and elongated cytoplasm, indicative of a migratory phenotype. Layer 3 is further subdivided into a low-cell-density sublayer 3a, enriched with myelinated axons and scattered DCX<sup>+</sup> clusters, and a high-cell-density sublayer 3b, characterized by large groups of DCX<sup>+</sup> migratory cells. In sagittal sections, these cells form long chains oriented parallel to the ventricular surface. Neuroblasts emerging from the dorsal V-SVZ migrate caudorostrally through the rostral migratory stream toward the olfactory bulb. The layered organization of the swine V-SVZ resembles that of humans, where DCX<sup>+</sup> chains persist up to 18 months of age, positioning the swine as a valuable model for investigating postnatal plasticity and neurogenic potential in gyrencephalic brains. The persistence of immature neurons in the V-SVZ of gyrencephalic mammals, including infant humans, underscores the relevance of this region for neurogenesis and plasticity in large-brained species.</p>

                Wu et al. developed a graph deep learning-based algorithm, “DeepMeta,” that can accurately predict the metabolic vulnerability of cancer patients based on the transcriptome and metabolic network information. DeepMeta can reveal metabolic dependency and provide new strategies for targeting cancer with undruggable driver mutations.

                Membrane potential plays a crucial role in various cellular functions. However, existing techniques for measuring membrane potential are often invasive or have limited recording depth. In contrast, MRI offers noninvasive imaging with desirable spatial resolution over large areas. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing MRI to detect responses of cultured cells and in vivo rat cortex to membrane potential-modulating ionic solutions by measuring magnetic resonance parameters. Our findings reveal that depolarizing (or hyperpolarizing) ionic solutions increase (or decrease) the <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> relaxation time, while the ratio of bound to free water protons shows the opposite trend. These findings also suggest a potential approach to noninvasively detect changes in membrane potential using MRI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101830">C-C chemokine receptor 4 deficiency exacerbates early atherosclerosis in mice</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation via dysregulation of T cell immune responses is critically involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Improving the balance between proinflammatory T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be an attractive approach for treating atherosclerosis. Although C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) has been shown to mediate the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues, its role in atherosclerosis is unclear. Here, we show that genetic deletion of CCR4 in hypercholesterolemic mice accelerates the development of early atherosclerotic lesions characterized by an inflammatory plaque phenotype. This was associated with the augmentation of proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) cell responses in peripheral lymphoid tissues, para-aortic lymph nodes, and atherosclerotic aorta. Mechanistically, CCR4 deficiency in Tregs impaired their suppressive function and tended to inhibit their migration to the atherosclerotic aorta, and subsequently augmented Th1 cell-mediated immune responses through defective regulation of dendritic cell function, which accelerated aortic inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development. Thus, we revealed a previously unrecognized role for CCR4 in controlling the early stage of atherosclerosis via Treg-dependent regulation of proinflammatory T cell responses. Our data suggest that CCR4 is an important negative regulator of atherosclerosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96414">The human cytomegalovirus-encoded pUS28 antagonizes CD4+ T cell recognition by targeting CIITA</a></h4>

              
                Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a relevant pathogen, especially for individuals with impaired immunity. Harnessing potent immune antagonists, HCMV circumvents sterile immunity. Given that HCMV prevents the upregulation of <i>human leukocyte antigen</i> (HLA)-DP and HLA-DR, we screened a library of HCMV genes by co-expression with the HLA class II (HLA-II)-inducing transcription coordinator <i>class II transactivator</i> (CIITA). We identified the latency regulator pUS28 as an interaction factor and potent viral antagonist of CIITA-driven expression of CD74, HLA-DR, HLA-DM, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. Both wt-pUS28 and a mutant incapable of inducing G protein-coupled signaling (R129A), but not a mutant lacking the C-terminus, drastically reduced the CIITA protein abundance post-transcriptionally. While control CD4 + T cells from HCMV-seropositive individuals vigorously responded to CIITA-expressing cells decorated with HCMV antigens, pUS28 expression was sufficient to inhibit HLA-II induction and immune recognition by HCMV-specific CD4 + T cells. Our data uncover pUS28 to be employed by HCMV to evade HLA-II-mediated recognition by CD4 + T cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103636">Elucidating the selection mechanisms in context-dependent computation through low-rank neural network modeling</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals exhibit a remarkable ability to selectively filter out irrelevant information based on context. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this context-dependent selection process remain elusive. Recently, the issue of discriminating between two prevalent selection mechanisms—input modulation versus selection vector modulation—with neural activity data has been highlighted as one of the major challenges in the study of individual variability underlying context-dependent decision-making (CDM). Here, we investigated these selection mechanisms through low-rank neural network modeling of the CDM task. We first showed that only input modulation was allowed in rank-one neural networks and additional dimensions of network connectivity were required to endow neural networks with selection vector modulation. Through rigorous information flow analysis, we gained a mechanistic understanding of why additional dimensions are required for selection vector modulation and how additional dimensions specifically contribute to selection vector modulation. This new understanding then led to the identification of novel neural dynamical signatures for selection vector modulation at both single neuron and population levels. Together, our results provide a rigorous theoretical framework linking network connectivity, neural dynamics, and selection mechanisms, paving the way towards elucidating the circuit mechanisms when studying individual variability in context-dependent computation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104996">Intrinsic dynamic shapes responses to external stimulation in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of ‘functional connectivity’ and ‘encoding models’, to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas have mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101850">Assemblies, synapse clustering, and network topology interact with plasticity to explain structure-function relationships of the cortical connectome</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity underlies the brain’s ability to learn and adapt. While experiments in brain slices have revealed mechanisms and protocols for the induction of plasticity between pairs of neurons, how these synaptic changes are coordinated in biological neuronal networks to ensure the emergence of learning remains poorly understood. Simulation and modeling have emerged as important tools to study learning in plastic networks, but have yet to achieve a scale that incorporates realistic network structure, active dendrites, and multi-synapse interactions, key determinants of synaptic plasticity. To rise to this challenge, we endowed an existing large-scale cortical network model, incorporating data-constrained dendritic processing and multi-synaptic connections, with a calcium-based model of functional plasticity that captures the diversity of excitatory connections extrapolated to in vivo-like conditions. This allowed us to study how dendrites and network structure interact with plasticity to shape stimulus representations at the microcircuit level. In our exploratory simulations, plasticity acted sparsely and specifically, firing rates and weight distributions remained stable without additional homeostatic mechanisms. At the circuit level, we found plasticity was driven by co-firing stimulus-evoked functional assemblies, spatial clustering of synapses on dendrites, and the topology of the network connectivity. As a result of the plastic changes, the network became more reliable with more stimulus-specific responses. We confirmed our testable predictions in the MICrONS datasets, an openly available electron microscopic reconstruction of a large volume of cortical tissue. Our results quantify at a large scale how the dendritic architecture and higher-order structure of cortical microcircuits play a central role in functional plasticity and provide a foundation for elucidating their role in learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99752">Heterogeneous efflux pump expression underpins phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial peptides</a></h4>

              
                Antimicrobial resistance threatens the viability of modern medical interventions. There is a dire need to develop novel approaches to counter resistance mechanisms employed by starved or slow-growing pathogens that are refractory to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been advocated as potential therapeutic solutions due to the low levels of genetic resistance observed in bacteria against these compounds. However, here we show that subpopulations of stationary phase <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> survive tachyplesin treatment without acquiring genetic mutations. These phenotypic variants display enhanced efflux activity to limit intracellular peptide accumulation. Differential regulation of genes involved in outer membrane vesicle secretion, membrane modification, and protease activity was also observed between phenotypically resistant and susceptible cells. We discovered that the formation of these phenotypic variants could be prevented by administering tachyplesin in combination with sertraline, a clinically used antidepressant, suggesting a novel approach for combatting antimicrobial-refractory stationary phase bacteria.
