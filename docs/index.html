<p>Consider a large number $n$ of neurons, each being connected to approximately
$N$ other ones, chosen at random. When a neuron spikes, which occurs randomly
at some rate depending on its electric potential, its potential is set to a
minimum value $v_{min}$, and this initiates, after a small delay, two fronts on
the (linear) dendrites of all the neurons to which it is connected. Fronts move
at constant speed. When two fronts (on the dendrite of the same neuron)
collide, they annihilate. When a front hits the soma of a neuron, its potential
is increased by a small value $w_n$. Between jumps, the potentials of the
neurons are assumed to drift in $[v_{min},\infty)$, according to some
well-posed ODE. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a heuristically
derived mean-field limit of the system when $n,N \to \infty$ with $w_n \simeq
N^{-1/2}$. We make use of some recent versions of the results of Deuschel and
Zeitouni \cite{dz} concerning the size of the longest increasing subsequence of
an i.i.d. collection of points in the plan. We also study, in a very particular
case, a slightly different model where the neurons spike when their potential
reach some maximum value $v_{max}$, and find an explicit formula for the
(heuristic) mean-field limit.

<p>When searching a target in a natural scene, both the target's visual
properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast)
humans are able to find it. However, thus far it has been unclear whether
searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations,
saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment
participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different
spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency
targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than
low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If
a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade
(saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were
not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the
endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that
these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers
adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion,
since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than
high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of
our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism
and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.

<p>The brain in conjunction with the body is able to adapt to new environments
and perform multiple behaviors through reuse of neural resources and transfer
of existing behavioral traits. Although mechanisms that underlie this ability
are not well known, they are largely attributed to neuromodulation. In this
work, we demonstrate that an agent can be multifunctional using the same
sensory and motor systems across behaviors, in the absence of modulatory
mechanisms. Further, we lay out the different levels at which neural reuse can
occur through a dynamical filtering of the brain-body-environment system's
operation - structural network, autonomous dynamics, and transient dynamics.
Notably, transient dynamics reuse can only be explained by studying the
brain-body-environment system as a whole and not just the brain. The
multifunctional agent we present here demonstrates neural reuse at all three
levels.

<p>Time series produced by dynamical systems as frequently the case in
neuroscience are rarely stationary but often exhibit quite abrupt changes due
to bifurcations or other dynamical phenomena. A plethora of methods for
detecting such changes in time series statistics, commonly called change point
analysis, have been developed over the years, in addition to test criteria to
evaluate change point significance. Issues to consider when developing such
methods include computational demands, difficulties arising from either limited
amount of data or a large number of covariates, and arriving at statistical
tests with sufficient power to detect as many change points as contained in
potentially high-dimensional data sets. Here, a general method called Paired
Adaptive Regressors for Cumulative Sum (PARCS) is developed for detecting
multiple change points in multivariate time series. The method's flexibility to
incorporate useful features from other change point detection techniques is
highlighted. The advantages of PARCS over existing approaches are demonstrated
through a series of simulation experiments, followed by a real data application
to neural recordings from rat medial prefrontal cortex during learning.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03405">Particle-without-Particle: a practical pseudospectral collocation method for numerical differential equations with distributional sources. (arXiv:1802.03405v1 [physics.comp-ph])</a></h4>

<p>Differential equations with distributional sources---in particular, involving
delta distributions and/or derivatives thereof---have become increasingly
ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of
considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but the
singular ("point-like") modeling of the sources in these problems typically
introduces nontrivial obstacles for devising a satisfactory numerical
implementation. A common method to circumvent these is through some form of
delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid, yet this
strategy often carries significant limitations.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such
equations: the "Particle-without-Particle" method. Previously introduced in the
context of the self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to
discretize the computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral
(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids in such a way that the "particle" (the singular
source location) is always at the interface between them; in this way, one only
needs to solve homogeneous equations in each domain, with the source
effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions thereon. We prove here that
this method is applicable to any linear PDE (of arbitrary order) the source of
which is a linear combination of one-dimensional delta distributions and
derivatives thereof supported at an arbitrary number of particles. We
furthermore apply this method to obtain numerical solutions for various types
of distributionally-sourced PDEs: we consider first-order hyperbolic equations
with applications to neuroscience models (describing neural populations),
parabolic equations with applications to financial models (describing price
formation), second-order hyperbolic equations with applications to wave
acoustics, and finally elliptic (Poisson) equations.

<p>Brain can be represented as a network, where regions are the nodes and
relations between the regions are edges. Within a network, co-existence of
cooperative and competitive relationships between different nodes is called
coopetition. Inter-regional genetic influences on morphological phenotypes
(cortical thickness, surface area) of cortex display such coopetitive
relationships. Here, we have represented these genetic influences as a network
and shown that cooperative and competitive genetic influences on cortical
morphological phenotypes follow distinct organization principles. Utilizing the
theory of structural balance, we have shown that the pattern of collective
regulation of cortical morphological phenotypes by cooperative and competitive
genetic influences are overall bilaterally symmetric and such patterns of
collective genetic regulation are similar to the principal modes of population
variation of cortical morphological phenotypes. Finally, we have observed that
the maximally and minimally imbalanced regions corresponding to the collective
genetic regulation partially overlap with the cortical structural network hubs.

The majority of the proteins encoded in the genomes of eukaryotes contain more than one domain. Reasons for high prevalence of multi-domain proteins in various organisms have been attributed to higher stability and functional and folding advantages over single-domain proteins. Despite these advantages, many proteins are composed of only one domain while their homologous domains are part of multi-domain proteins. In the study presented here, differences in the properties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and their influence on functions are discussed. We studied 20 pairs of identical protein domains, which were crystallized in two forms (a) tethered to other proteins domains and (b) tethered to fewer protein domains than (a) or not tethered to any protein domain. Results suggest that tethering of domains in multi-domain proteins influences the structural, dynamic and energetic properties of the constituent protein domains. 50% of the protein domain pairs show significant structural deviations while 90% of the protein domain pairs show differences in dynamics and 12% of the residues show differences in the energetics. To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the function of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of them is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a part of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical and structurally equivalent functional residues show differential dynamics in homologous protein domains; though comparable dynamics between <i>in-silico</i> generated chimera protein and multi-domain proteins were observed. From these observations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins could be attributed to the presence of tethered domain. Overall, we conclude that tethered domains in multi-domain proteins not only provide stability or folding advantages but also influence pathways resulting in differences in function or regulatory properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_feLOM8p4JU" width="1" />

Implantable retinal stimulators activate surviving neurons to restore a sense of vision in people who have lost their photoreceptors through degenerative diseases. Complex spatial and temporal interactions occur in the retina during multi-electrode stimulation. Due to these complexities, most existing implants activate only a few electrodes at a time, limiting the repertoire of available stimulation patterns. Measuring the spatiotemporal interactions between electrodes and retinal cells, and incorporating them into a model may lead to improved stimulation algorithms that exploit the interactions. Here, we present a computational model that accurately predicts both the spatial and temporal nonlinear interactions of multi-electrode stimulation of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The model was verified using <i>in vitro</i> recordings of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs in response to subretinal multi-electrode stimulation with biphasic pulses at three stimulation frequencies (10, 20, 30 Hz). The model gives an estimate of each cell‚Äôs spatiotemporal electrical receptive fields (ERFs); i.e., the pattern of stimulation leading to excitation or suppression in the neuron. All cells had excitatory ERFs and many also had suppressive sub-regions of their ERFs. We show that the nonlinearities in observed responses arise largely from activation of presynaptic interneurons. When synaptic transmission was blocked, the number of sub-regions of the ERF was reduced, usually to a single excitatory ERF. This suggests that direct cell activation can be modeled accurately by a one-dimensional model with linear interactions between electrodes, whereas indirect stimulation due to summated presynaptic responses is nonlinear.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2zHEkI8H2O8" width="1" />

Studies of nervous system connectivity, in a wide variety of species and at different scales of resolution, have identified several highly conserved motifs of network organization. One such motif is a heterogeneous distribution of connectivity across neural elements, such that some elements act as highly connected and functionally important network hubs. These brain network hubs are also densely interconnected, forming a so-called rich club. Recent work in mouse has identified a distinctive transcriptional signature of neural hubs, characterized by tightly coupled expression of oxidative metabolism genes, with similar genes characterizing macroscale inter-modular hub regions of the human cortex. Here, we sought to determine whether hubs of the neuronal <i>C. elegans</i> connectome also show tightly coupled gene expression. Using open data on the chemical and electrical connectivity of 279 <i>C. elegans</i> neurons, and binary gene expression data for each neuron across 948 genes, we computed a correlated gene expression score for each pair of neurons, providing a measure of their gene expression similarity. We demonstrate that connections between hub neurons are the most similar in their gene expression while connections between nonhubs are the least similar. Genes with the greatest contribution to this effect are involved in glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling, and other communication processes. We further show that coupled expression between hub neurons cannot be explained by their neuronal subtype (i.e., sensory, motor, or interneuron), separation distance, chemically secreted neurotransmitter, birth time, pairwise lineage distance, or their topological module affiliation. Instead, this coupling is intrinsically linked to the identity of most hubs as command interneurons, a specific class of interneurons that regulates locomotion. Our results suggest that neural hubs may possess a distinctive transcriptional signature, preserved across scales and species, that is related to the involvement of hubs in regulating the higher-order behaviors of a given organism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aI9N3og0p1U" width="1" />

<p>by Rich Pang, Floris van Breugel, Michael Dickinson, Jeffrey A. Riffell, Adrienne Fairhall</p>

Natural decision-making often involves extended decision sequences in response to variable stimuli with complex structure. As an example, many animals follow odor plumes to locate food sources or mates, but turbulence breaks up the advected odor signal into intermittent filaments and puffs. This scenario provides an opportunity to ask how animals use sparse, instantaneous, and stochastic signal encounters to generate goal-oriented behavioral sequences. Here we examined the trajectories of flying fruit flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) and mosquitoes (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) navigating in controlled plumes of attractive odorants. While it is known that mean odor-triggered flight responses are dominated by upwind turns, individual responses are highly variable. We asked whether deviations from mean responses depended on specific features of odor encounters, and found that odor-triggered turns were slightly but significantly modulated by two features of odor encounters. First, encounters with higher concentrations triggered stronger upwind turns. Second, encounters occurring later in a sequence triggered weaker upwind turns. To contextualize the latter history dependence theoretically, we examined trajectories simulated from three normative tracking strategies. We found that neither a purely reactive strategy nor a strategy in which the tracker learned the plume centerline over time captured the observed history dependence. In contrast, ‚Äúinfotaxis‚Äù, in which flight decisions maximized expected information gain about source location, exhibited a history dependence aligned in sign with the data, though much larger in magnitude. These findings suggest that while true plume tracking is dominated by a reactive odor response it might also involve a history-dependent modulation of responses consistent with the accumulation of information about a source over multi-encounter timescales. This suggests that short-term memory processes modulating decision sequences may play a role in natural plume tracking.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NS0UxQs8qhA" width="1" />

<p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Pascal Chameau, Wytse J. Wadman</p>

Mammalian thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons switch their firing activity between a tonic spiking and a bursting regime. In a combined experimental and computational study, we investigated the features in the input signal that single spikes and bursts in the output spike train represent and how this code is influenced by the membrane voltage state of the neuron. Identical frozen Gaussian noise current traces were injected into TCR neurons in rat brain slices as well as in a validated three-compartment TCR model cell. The resulting membrane voltage traces and spike trains were analyzed by calculating the coherence and impedance. Reverse correlation techniques gave the Event-Triggered Average (ETA) and the Event-Triggered Covariance (ETC). This demonstrated that the feature selectivity started relatively long before the events (up to 300 ms) and showed a clear distinction between spikes (selective for fluctuations) and bursts (selective for integration). The model cell was fine-tuned to mimic the frozen noise initiated spike and burst responses to within experimental accuracy, especially for the mixed mode regimes. The information content carried by the various types of events in the signal as well as by the whole signal was calculated. Bursts phase-lock to and transfer information at lower frequencies than single spikes. On depolarization the neuron transits smoothly from the predominantly bursting regime to a spiking regime, in which it is more sensitive to high-frequency fluctuations. The model was then used to elucidate properties that could not be assessed experimentally, in particular the role of two important subthreshold voltage-dependent currents: the low threshold activated calcium current (<i>I</i><sub>T</sub>) and the cyclic nucleotide modulated h current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>). The ETAs of those currents and their underlying activation/inactivation states not only explained the state dependence of the firing regime but also the long-lasting concerted dynamic action of the two currents. Finally, the model was used to investigate the more realistic ‚Äúhigh-conductance state‚Äù, where fluctuations are caused by (synaptic) conductance changes instead of current injection. Under ‚Äústandard‚Äù conditions bursts are difficult to initiate, given the high degree of inactivation of the T-type calcium current. Strong and/or precisely timed inhibitory currents were able to remove this inactivation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c6sziGsfR6A" width="1" />

<p>by Margriet M. Palm, Marjet Elemans, Joost B. Beltman</p>

Tumors consist of a hierarchical population of cells that differ in their phenotype and genotype. This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones (i.e., cells and several generations of offspring) are abundant while most are rare, which is called <i>clonal dominance</i>. Such dominance also occurred in published <i>in vitro</i> iterated growth and passage experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing. A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ongoing evolution and selection within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance. To understand how clonal dominance developed in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments. The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in <i>in vitro</i> iterated growth and passage experiments when the division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes. In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells. Altogether, our model suggests that <i>in vitro</i> clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wyJceEhZ628" width="1" />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‚Äòlook and behave‚Äô like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Jee-Yeon   Hwang, R Suzanne   Zukin<br /> The restrictive element-1 silencing transcription factor)/NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a transcriptional repressor which acts via epigenetic remodeling to silence target genes. Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and Œ≤-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   √ñlveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‚Äòcontextual‚Äô information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Elena   Marcello, Monica   Di Luca, Fabrizio   Gardoni<br /> In the last decade several synaptonuclear protein messengers including Jacob, CRTC1, AIDA-1, ProSaP2/Shank3 and RNF10 have been identified and characterized as key players for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />

Abstract<p>Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6-18 months of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning including extracellular K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K<sup>+</sup> regulation by astrocytes. Loss of function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients results in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by ChIP analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &gt;50% deficiency in Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell-autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10 000-25 000 females. Mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional regulator, are responsible for over 95% of Rett cases. Recent work has shown that astrocytes contribute significantly to the disorder, although their contribution to this disease is not known. Here we demonstrate that the critical astrocyte K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.1 is a novel molecular target of MeCP2. MeCP2 deficiency leads to decreased <i>Kcnj10</i>/Kir4.1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and currents. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight and begin to elucidate the role of astrocytes in this disorder.</p>

Abstract<p>Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45¬∞ or 135¬∞) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS-, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS- stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS- in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In neuroimaging studies of human fear conditioning, activation of the amygdala is often not observed. This problem is examined by applying single-trial fMRI analysis to a classical fear conditioning paradigm. In addition to confirming the amygdala adaptation hypothesis, we discovered that areas of the salience network, to which the amygdala belongs, co-adapted, supporting the hypothesis that the acquisition of defensive responses in humans is mediated by changes in a large-scale brain network.</p>

Abstract<p>Axonal spike is an important upstream process of transmitter release, which directly impacts on release probability from the presynaptic terminals. Despite the functional significance, possible activity-dependent modulation of axonal spikes has not been studied extensively, partly due to inaccessibility of the small structures of axons for electrophysiological recordings. In this study, we tested the possibility of use-dependent changes in axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, where direct recordings from the axon terminals are readily feasible. Hippocampal slices were made from mice of either sex, and loose-patch clamp recordings were obtained from the visually identified giant mossy fiber boutons located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Stimulation of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited axonal spikes at the single bouton which occurred in all or none fashion. Unexpected from the digital nature of spike signaling, the peak amplitude of the second spikes in response to paired stimuli at 50 ms interval was slightly but reproducibly smaller than the first spikes. Repetitive stimuli at 20 Hz or 100 Hz also caused progressive use-dependent depression during the train. Notably, veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, significantly accelerated the depression with minimal effect on the initial spikes. These results suggest that sodium channels contribute to use-dependent depression of axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, possibly by shaping the afterdepolarization (ADP) following axonal spikes. Prolonged depolarization during ADP may inactivate a fraction of sodium channels and thereby suppresses the subsequent spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Spike signaling along axons is thought to highly reliable digital process. In this study, we tested the possibility of analog tuning of axonal spikes using direct recordings from single hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. We found that axonal spikes are subject to robust use-dependent short-term depression. Notably, the application of veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, selectively accelerates short-term depression with minimal effect on the initial axonal spikes. These results illustrate the novel form of short-term plasticity of axonal spikes in single axon terminal levels, and suggest that slow activating sodium channels of persistent-type (I<sub>NaP</sub>) or resurgent types (I<sub>NaR</sub>), different from the transient-type (I<sub>NaT</sub>) responsible for spike generation, might be involved in modulation of paired-pulse depression of axonal spikes.</p>

<p>The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a
hallmark of biological vision. Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in
visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in
their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes
impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We
further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational
network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual
question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar
limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue
that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key
computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.

Hearing loss is a widespread condition that is linked to declines in quality of life and mental health. Hearing aids remain the treatment of choice, but, unfortunately, even state-of-the-art devices provide only limited benefit for the perception of speech in noisy environments. While traditionally viewed primarily as a loss of sensitivity, hearing loss is also known to cause complex distortions of sound-evoked neural activity that cannot be corrected by amplification alone. This Opinion article describes the effects of hearing loss on neural activity to illustrate the reasons why current hearing aids are insufficient and to motivate the use of new technologies to explore directions for improving the next generation of devices.

Many scientific fields currently face the daunting task of studying the dynamics of complex networks. For example, while we know that the rich mental phenomena of humans and other animals are mediated by complex systems of neural circuits in the brain, the mechanistic links between these biological networks and the functions that they mediate are poorly understood. Here we present a novel class of methods, termed multivariate directed connectivity analysis, to investigate network dynamics via patterns of directed interactions between network nodes. We validate these methods using simulated data and apply them to three real-world datasets, two neuroscientific and one investigating the 2016 US presidential candidates' influence on the social media service Twitter. We find that these methods enable novel understanding of how information processing is distributed across networks. The methods are generally applicable to the study of dynamic information networks in biological, computational, and other fields of research.

Rodents are often used for studying chronic pain mechanisms and developing new pain therapeutics, but objectively determining the animals pain state is a major challenge. To improve the precision of using reflexive withdrawal behaviors for interpreting the mouse pain state, we adopted high-speed videography to capture sub-second movement features of mice upon hind paw stimulation. We identified several parameters that are significantly different between behaviors evoked by innocuous and noxious stimuli, and combined them to map the mouse pain state through statistical modeling and machine learning. To test the utility of this approach, we determined the pain state triggered by von Frey hairs (VFHs) and optogenetic activation of two nociceptor populations. Our method reliably assesses the pain-like probability for each mouse paw withdrawal reflex under all scenarios, highlighting the precision of using this high resolution behavior-centered composite methodology to determine the mouse pain state from reflexive withdrawal assays.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263376v1?rss=1">Increasing the Mobility of EEG Data Collection Using a Latte Panda Computer</a></h4>

Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments often require several computers to ensure accurate stimulus presentation and data collection. However, this requirement can make it more difficult to perform such experiments in mobile settings within, or outside, the laboratory. New Method: Computer miniaturisation and increasing processing power allow for EEG experiments to become more portable. Our goal is to show that a Latte Panda, a small Windows 10 computer, can be used to accurately collect EEG data in a similar manner to a laptop. Using a stationary bike, we also demonstrate that the Latte Panda will allow for more portable EEG experiments. Results: Significant and reliable MMN and P3 responses, event-related potentials (ERPs) typically associated with auditory oddball tasks, were observed and were consistent when using either the laptop or Latte Panda for EEG data collection. Similar MMN and P3 ERPs were also measured in the sitting and stationary biking conditions while using a Latte Panda for data collection. Comparison with Existing Method: Data recorded by the Latte Panda computer produced comparable and equally reliable results to the laptop. As well, similar ERPs during sitting and biking would suggest that EEG experiments can be conducted in more mobile situations despite the increased noise and artefacts associated with muscle movement. Conclusions: Our results show that the Latte Panda is a low-cost, more portable alternative to a laptop computer for recording EEG data. Such a device will further allow for more portable and mobile EEG experimentation in a wider variety of environments.

In humans and flies, sleep is a highly organized behavior, occurring in discrete bouts that are consolidated at night but have a more fragmented structure during the day. Longer episodes correlate with transitions to deeper sleep states for both species, and sleep fragmentation has been shown to have deleterious outcomes for a large number of physiological processes. In mammals and birds, EEG provides an excellent measure of sleep structure and state. In invertebrates, assessment of sleep structure has relied on measures of episode duration, which can fail to capture important aspects of sleep architecture. Here we model Drosophila sleep as a probabilistic behavior and develop analytical tools to measure transition probabilities and the organization of sleep episodes within a defined analysis window. We show that these tools provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of normal sleep and into how they are altered in pathological conditions. The probability of transition to the wake state, P(Wake) is a major driver of normal sleep and responsive to dopaminergic tone, suggesting it is a measure of arousal. Our method for assessing sleep fragmentation adds important information about the organization of sleep bouts that is missing in measures of episode duration alone. Importantly, the ability to obtain a measure of the probability structure underlying sleep in a particular condition or genotype provides a way to compare the state of brain sleep circuits across conditions that utilizes information from all of the many processes that influence sleep.

Neural oscillations have been implicated in many different basic brain and cognitive processes. Oscillatory activity has been suggested to play a role in neural binding, and more recently in the maintenance of information in working memory. This latter work has focused primarily on oscillations in terms of providing a "code" in working memory. However, oscillations may additionally play a fundamental role in essential properties and behaviors that neuronal networks must exhibit in order to produce functional working memory. In the present work, we present a biologically plausible working memory model and demonstrate that specific types of stable oscillatory dynamics may play a critical role in facilitating properties of working memory, including transitions between different memory states and a multi-item working memory capacity. We also show these oscillatory dynamics may facilitate and provide an underlying mechanism to enable a range of different types of binding in the context of working memory.

Oscillatory neural activity is a fundamental characteristic of the mammalian brain spanning multiple levels of spatial and temporal scales. Current theories of neural oscillations and analysis techniques employed to investigate their functional significance are based on an often implicit assumption: In the absence of experimental manipulation, the spectral content of any given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator remains approximately stationary over the course of a typical experimental session (~1 hour). Here, we show that this assumption is inaccurate for ongoing neural oscillations in one of the most prominent frequency bands of the EEG/MEG signal, the alpha band (8:13 Hz). We found that alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over time, while alpha power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic trends occurred independently of each other suggesting the existence of two non-stationary endogenous processes inherent in macroscopic alpha band activity. Our findings provide novel insight into the time-varying intrinsic properties of large-scale neural networks. They have important implications for the analysis and interpretation of studies that aim at identifying functionally relevant oscillatory networks or at driving them through external stimulation.

Objective: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have an extremely high genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) however the course of cognitive decline associated with progression to dementia is ill-defined. Data-driven methods can estimate long-term trends from cross-sectional data while adjusting for variability in baseline ability, which complicates dementia assessment in those with DS. Methods: We applied an event-based model to cognitive test data and informant-rated questionnaires from 283 adults with DS (the largest study of cognitive functioning in DS to date) to estimate the sequence of cognitive decline and individuals' disease stage. Results: Decline in tests of memory, motor coordination, and verbal fluency occurred early, demonstrating that AD in DS follow a similar pattern of change to other forms of AD. Later decline was found for informant measures. Using the resulting staging model, we showed that adults with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and with APOE e4 genotype were significantly more likely to be staged later, suggesting the model is valid. Interpretation: Memory and attention tests may be particularly useful measures to track decline in the preclinical/prodromal stages of AD in DS whereas informant-measures may be useful in later stages (i.e. During conversion to dementia, or post-diagnosis). These results have implications for the selection of outcome measures of treatment trials to delay or prevent cognitive decline due to AD in DS. As clinical diagnoses are generally made late into AD progression, early assessment is essential.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263079v1?rss=1">Redundancy makes music and speech robust to individual differences in perception</a></h4>

Communicative auditory signals express their structure through acoustic dimensions such as pitch and timing. Individuals' abilities to perceive these dimensions vary widely, and yet most people seem to comprehend music and speech easily. How? Here we tested whether redundancy - multiple acoustic cues indexing the same feature - makes music and speech robust to such individual differences. A model population with a severe and specific deficit for perceiving pitch (congenital amusics) and controls completed 3 tasks, each testing whether they could take advantage of redundancy. In each task, performance relied on either pitch or duration perception alone, or both together redundantly. Results showed that when redundant cues are present, even people with a severe deficit for one type of cue can rely on another to improve their performance. This suggests that redundancy may be a design feature of music and language, one that assures transmission between people with diverse perceptual abilities.

Abnormal salience processing has been suggested to contribute to the formation of positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related conditions. Previous research utilising reward learning or anticipation paradigms has demonstrated cortical and subcortical abnormalities in people with psychosis, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum. In these paradigms, reward prediction errors attribute motivational salience to stimuli. However, little is known about possible abnormalities across different forms of salience processing in psychosis patients, and whether any such abnormalities involve the dopaminergic midbrain. The aim of our study was, therefore, to investigate possible alterations in psychosis in neural activity in response to various forms of salience: novelty, negative emotion, targetness (task-driven salience) and rareness. We studied 14 antipsychotic naive participants with first episode psychosis, and 37 healthy volunteers. During fMRI scanning, participants performed a visual oddball task containing these four forms of salience. Psychosis patients showed abnormally reduced signalling in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and the cingulate gyrus for novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness; reduced striatal signalling to novelty and negative emotional salience, and reduced signalling in the right amygdala to negative emotional salience. There was reduced cerebellar activation to targetness in the patients, consistent with abnormal efference copy transmission in preparation of a motor response. Our results indicate that generalised salience processing alterations in patients with psychosis, mainly involving the dopaminergic SN/VTA, the cingulate gyrus and the striatum.

Non-heme iron is a critical metabolic cofactor essential for healthy development. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder in the world, with greater prevalence of non-heme iron deficiency among individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES). However, it remains unknown how brain iron accumulation during development may impact cognition. Brain iron can be measured in vivo using R2* weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we used R2* MRI to quantify iron in the basal ganglia (BG) in a large sample of youth ages 8-23 imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (N=1,147, 54% female). Mean R2* signal within each bilateral BG region was modeled using generalized additive models with penalized splines to capture both linear and nonlinear developmental effects. As expected from prior reports, R2* increased in the BG throughout youth (all regions pfdr&lt;0.001). Across all ages, lower R2* levels in the caudate (pfdr&lt;0.02) was associated with diminished cognitive performance. Lower neighborhood SES was associated with both diminished cognition (p&lt;0.001), as well as lower R2* in the caudate (pfdr=0.02). Critically, the relationship between cognition and SES was significantly mediated by caudate R2* (p=0.007). Taken together, these results suggest that brain iron is important for facilitating cognitive development in youth, and may provide a mechanism by which public health interventions focused on improving nutrition in low SES neighborhoods might aid cognitive development.

While extra-personal space is often erroneously considered as a unique entity, early neuropsychological studies report a dissociation between near and far space processing both in humans and in monkeys. Here, we use functional MRI in a naturalistic 3D environment to describe the non-human primate near and far space cortical networks. We describe the co-occurrence of two extended functional networks respectively dedicated to near and far space processing. Specifically, far space processing involves occipital, temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate as well as orbitofrontal regions not activated by near space, possibly subserving the processing of the shape and identity of objects. In contrast, near space processing involves temporal, parietal and prefrontal regions not activated by far space, possibly subserving the preparation of an arm/hand mediated action in this proximal space. Interestingly, this network also involves somatosensory regions, suggesting a cross-modal anticipation of touch by a nearby object. Last, we also describe cortical regions that process both far and near space with a preference for one or the other. This suggests a continuous encoding of relative distance to the body, in the form of a far-to-near gradient. We propose that these cortical gradients in space representation subserve the physically delineable peripersonal spaces described in numerous psychology and psychophysics studies.

Movement disorders arise from the complex interplay between multiple changes to neural circuits, and between those changes and their compensatory mechanisms. Treatments, when available, either have incompletely understood mechanisms of action, or unknown routes from these mechanisms to the amelioration of the disorder's symptoms. Using Parkinson's disease as a case-study, we review here how computational models are a crucial tool for taming this complexity, across causative mechanisms, consequent neural dynamics, and treatments. For mechanisms, we review models that capture the effects of losing dopamine on basal ganglia function; for dynamics, we discuss models that have transformed our understanding of how beta-band (15-30 Hz) oscillations arise in the parkinsonian basal ganglia. For treatments, we touch on the breadth of computational modelling work trying to understand the therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation. Collectively, models from across all levels of description are providing a compelling account of the causes, symptoms, and treatments for Parkinson's disease.

INTRODUCTION: Down syndrome (DS) is associated with elevated risk for Alzheimers disease (AD) and lifelong accumulation of beta amyloid (A{beta}). The current work addresses two major gaps in our understanding of Alzheimers disease (AD) in Downs Syndrome (DS): (1) regional amyloid aggregation and reliability in predicting onset or progression of disease in sporadic AD, and (2) the contributions of regional amyloid burden to AD progression in DS. We hypothesized that the spatial distribution of A{beta} plaque burden predicts transition to dementia in individuals with DS. METHODS: We acquired 18F-Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans on nineteen non-demented adult individuals with DS at baseline and monitored them clinically over a four year period, identifying five individuals who transitioned to dementia. We used machine learning classification to determine features on 18F-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maps that were most predictive of transition. RESULTS: Of the nineteen participants, fourteen remained non-demented (age 50.4{+/-}4.3 yrs.;10M/4F) and five transitioned to dementia (age 52.1{+/-}5.7;2M/3F) over the study period. Compared with non-transitioned participants, those who transitioned showed increased amyloid binding in the middle and superior orbital-frontal and superior temporal lobes (t(14)=3.8;p&lt;0.001 unc.) with corresponding Cohens d effect sizes ranged from 1.4-3.2. Increased amyloid burden in subjects who transitioned temporally closer to the baseline PET scan were found in the middle and superior temporal lobes (t(3)=10.2; p&lt;0.001 unc.). The coefficient of determination (r squared) measures ranged from 0.87-0.98 corresponding to a strong relationship between regional amyloid burden and the transition time to clinical dementia. Using regional amyloid burden to predict future transition using 10-fold cross-validated logistic regression classifiers resulted in inferior parietal lobe (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.96{+/-}0.04), inferior and superior temporal lobes (AUC=0.92{+/-}0.11; 0.93{+/-}0.10), and lateral orbital-frontal lobes (AUC=0.92{+/-}0.11) as the most predictive signals. DISCUSSION: The spatial distribution of A{beta} burden in individuals with DS, and in particular 18F-Florbetapir uptake in the orbitofrontal and inferior parietal cortices, may serve as biomarkers, predicting clinical transition to dementia in DS.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/234005v1?rss=1">Control of Spreading Depression with Electrical Fields</a></h4>

Spreading depression or depolarization is a large-scale pathological brain phenomenon related to migraine, stroke, hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. Once initiated, spreading depression propagates across gray matter extruding potassium and other active molecules, collapsing the resting membrane electro-chemical gradient of cells leading to spike inactivation and cellular swelling, and propagates independently of synaptic transmission. We demonstrate the modulation, suppression and prevention of spreading depression utilizing applied transcortical DC electric fields in brain slices, measured with intrinsic optical imaging and potassium dye epifluorescence. We experimentally observe a surface-positive electric field induced forcing of spreading depression propagation to locations in cortex deeper than the unmodulated propagation path, whereby further propagation is confined and arrested even after field termination. The opposite surface-negative electric field polarity produces an increase in propagation velocity and a confinement of the wave to more superficial layers of cortex than the unmodulated propagation path. These field polarities are of opposite sign to the polarity that blocks neuronal spiking and seizures, and are consistent with biophysical models of spreading depression. The results demonstrate the potential feasibility of electrical control and prevention of spreading depression.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263889v1?rss=1">Long time-scales in primate amygdala neurons support aversive learning</a></h4>

Associative learning forms when there is temporal relationship between a stimulus and a reinforcer, yet the inter-trial-interval (ITI), which is usually much longer than the stimulus-reinforcer-interval, contributes to learning-rate and memory strength. The neural mechanisms that enable maintenance of time between trials remain unknown, and it is unclear if the amygdala can support time scales at the order of dozens of seconds. We show that the ITI indeed modulates rate and strength of aversive-learning, and that single-units in the primate amygdala and dorsal-anterior-cingulate-cortex signal confined periods within the ITI, strengthen this coding during acquisition of aversive-associations, and diminish during extinction. Additionally, pairs of amygdala-cingulate neurons synchronize during specific periods suggesting a shared circuit that maintains the long temporal gap. The results extend the known roles of this circuit and suggest a mechanism that maintains trial-structure and temporal-contingencies for learning. It further suggests a novel model for maladaptive behaviors.

Prolonged neurotransmitter release following synaptic stimulation extends the time window for postsynaptic neurons to respond to presynaptic activity. This can enhance excitability and increase synchrony of outputs, but the prevalence of this at normally highly synchronous synapses is unclear. We show that the postsynaptic channel, pannexin-1 (Panx1) regulates prolonged glutamate release onto CA1 neurons. Block of postsynaptic (CA1 neuronal) Panx1 increased the frequency of glutamate neurotransmission and action potentials in these neurons following Schaffer collateral stimulation. When Panx1 was blocked, anandamide levels increase and activated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated glutamate release. This TRPV1-induced synaptic acitvity enhanced excitability and translated into a faster rate of TRPV1-dependent epileptogenesis induced by kindling. We conclude that Panx1 facilitates AEA clearance to maintain synchronous release onto CA1 neurons so that when AEA clearance is reduced, TRPV1 channels prolong glutamate neurotransmission to enhance network output to promote epileptiform activity.

Visual motion detection in sighted animals is essential to guide behavioral actions ensuring their survival. In Drosophila, motion direction is first detected by T4/T5 neurons. Their axons innervate four lobula plate layers tuned to the four cardinal motion directions. How T4/T5 neurons with layer-specific representation of motion-direction preferences are specified during development is unknown. We show that diffusible Wingless (Wg) between adjacent neuroepithelia induces its own expression to form secondary signaling centers. These activate decapentaplegic (dpp) in apposing tertiary domains dedicated to producing layer 3/4-specific T4/T5 neurons. In the absence of Dpp signaling, T4/T5 neurons adopt the default layer 1/2 fate. Dpp signaling induces the expression of the T-box transcription factor Optomotor-blind (Omb), serving as a relay to postmitotic neurons. Omb-mediated repression of Dachshund transforms layer 1/2- into layer 3/4-specific neurons. Hence, spatio-temporal relay mechanisms, bridging the distances between neuroepithelial domains and their postmitotic progeny, implement T4/T5 neuron layer-specificity.

<p>Speech is an ecologically essential signal, whose processing crucially involves the subcortical nuclei of the auditory brainstem, but there are few experimental options for studying these early responses in human listeners under natural conditions. While encoding of continuous natural speech has been successfully probed in the cortex with neurophysiological tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography, the rapidity of subcortical response components combined with unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios signal-to-noise ratio has prevented application of those methods to the brainstem. Instead, experiments have used thousands of repetitions of simple stimuli such as clicks, tone-bursts, or brief spoken syllables, with deviations from those paradigms leading to ambiguity in the neural origins of measured responses. In this study we developed and tested a new way to measure the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to ongoing, naturally uttered speech, using EEG to record from human listeners. We found a high degree of morphological similarity between the speech-derived ABRs and the standard click-evoked ABR, in particular, a preserved Wave V, the most prominent voltage peak in the standard click-evoked ABR. Because this method yields distinct peaks that recapitulate the canonical ABR, at latencies too short to originate from the cortex, the responses measured can be unambiguously determined to be subcortical in origin. The use of naturally uttered speech to measure the ABR allows the design of engaging behavioral tasks, facilitating new investigations of the potential effects of cognitive processes like language and attention on brainstem processing.</p>

Abstract
<p>Transient receptor potential channel, TRPM4, the putative molecular substrate for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonselective cation current (<i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>), is hypothesized to generate bursting activity of pre-BoÃàtzinger complex (pre-BoÃàtC) inspiratory neurons and critically contribute to respiratory rhythmogenesis. Another TRP channel, TRPC3, which mediates Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, may be involved in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling, including affecting TRPM4/<i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> in respiratory pre-BoÃàtC neurons. However, TRPM4 and TRPC3 expression in pre-BoÃàtC inspiratory neurons and functional roles of these channels remain to be determined. By single-cell multiplex RT-PCR, we show mRNA expression for these channels in pre-BoÃàtC inspiratory neurons in rhythmically active medullary <i>in vitro</i> slices from neonatal rats and mice. Functional contributions were analyzed with pharmacological inhibitors of TRPM4 or TRPC3 <i>in vitro</i> as well as in mature rodent arterially perfused <i>in situ</i> brainstem‚Äìspinal cord preparations. Perturbations of respiratory circuit activity were also compared with those by a blocker of <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>. Pharmacologically attenuating endogenous activation of TRPM4, TRPC3, or <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> <i>in vitro</i> similarly reduced the amplitude of inspiratory motoneuronal activity without significant perturbations of inspiratory frequency or variability of the rhythm. Amplitude perturbations were correlated with reduced inspiratory glutamatergic pre-BoÃàtC neuronal activity, monitored by multicellular dynamic calcium imaging <i>in vitro.</i> In more intact circuits <i>in situ</i>, the reduction of pre-BoÃàtC and motoneuronal inspiratory activity amplitude was accompanied by reduced post-inspiratory motoneuronal activity, without disruption of rhythm generation. We conclude that endogenously activated TRPM4, which likely mediates <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>, and TRPC3 channels in pre-BoÃàtC inspiratory neurons play fundamental roles in respiratory pattern formation but are not critically involved in respiratory rhythm generation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Electrical signals generated by molecularly-distinct classes of lateral hypothalamus (LH) neurons have distinct physiological consequences. For example, LH orexin neurons promote net body energy expenditure, while LH non-orexin neurons [VGAT, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)] drive net energy conservation. Appropriate switching between such physiologically-opposing LH outputs is traditionally thought to require cell-type-specific chemical modulation of LH firing. However, it was recently found that, <i>in vivo,</i> the LH neurons are also physiologically exposed to electrical oscillations of different frequency bands. The role of the different physiological oscillation frequencies in firing of orexin vs non-orexin LH neurons remains unknown. Here, we used brain-slice whole-cell patch-clamp technology to target precisely-defined oscillation waveforms to individual molecularly-defined classes LH cells (orexin, VGAT, MCH, GAD65), while measuring the action potential output of the cells. By modulating the frequency of sinusoidal oscillatory input, we found that high-frequency oscillations (, 30‚Äì200 Hz) preferentially silenced the action potential output orexin<sub>LH</sub> cells. In contrast, low frequencies (-, 0.5‚Äì7 Hz) similarly permitted outputs from different LH cell types. This differential control of orexin and non-orexin cells by oscillation frequency was mediated by cell-specific, impedance-unrelated resonance mechanisms. These results substantiate electrical oscillations as a novel input modality for cell-type-specific control of LH firing, which offers an unforeseen way to control specific cell ensembles within this highly heterogeneous neuronal cluster.</p>

Abstract<p>The efficacy of synaptic transmission is determined by the number of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses. Their recruitment depends upon the availability of postsynaptic scaffolding molecules that interact with specific binding sequences of the receptor. At inhibitory synapses, gephyrin is the major scaffold protein that mediates the accumulation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) via the cytoplasmic loop in the Œ≤-subunit (Œ≤-loop). This binding involves high- and low-affinity interactions, but the molecular mechanism of this bimodal binding and its implication in GlyR stabilization at synapses remain unknown. We have approached this question using a combination of quantitative biochemical tools and high-density single molecule tracking in cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The high-affinity binding site could be identified and was shown to rely on the formation of a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix C-terminal to the Œ≤-loop core gephyrin-binding motif. This site plays a structural role in shaping the core motif and represents the major contributor to the synaptic confinement of GlyRs by gephyrin. The N-terminal flanking sequence promotes lower affinity interactions by occupying newly identified binding sites on gephyrin. Despite its low affinity, this binding site plays a modulatory role in tuning the mobility of the receptor. Taken together, the GlyR Œ≤-loop sequences flanking the core-binding site differentially regulate the affinity of the receptor for gephyrin and its trapping at synapses. Our experimental approach thus bridges the gap between thermodynamic aspects of receptor-scaffold interactions and functional receptor stabilization at synapses in living cells.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The number of receptors at a synapse defines the strength of signal transmission and is directly dependent on the binding of the receptors to scaffold proteins beneath the synaptic membrane. In this study, we discovered the molecular basis for a dual-affinity interaction between GlyRs and gephyrin scaffolds. We identified GlyR sequences that are specifically required for high- and low-affinity binding. Using single-molecule tracking in cultured neurons both sites were shown to act as elements regulating the diffusion and trapping of GlyRs as a result of the altered receptor-scaffold binding. The novelty of our approach lies in the unique combination of biochemical data of purified proteins with single molecule diffusion analysis. It exemplifies that binding properties can be extracted by analyzing the diffusion behavior of molecules in living cells.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25152">A mendelian form of neural tube defect caused by a de novo null variant in SMARCC1 in an identical twin</a></h4>

<div class="para"><p>Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans and yet their molecular etiology remains poorly understood. NTDs are believed to result from the complex interaction of environmental factors with a multitude of genetic risk factors in a classical multifactorial disease model. Mendelian forms of NTDs in which single variants are sufficient to cause the disease are extremely rare. We report a monozygotic twin with severe NTDs (occipital encephalocele and myelomeningocele) and a shared de novo, likely truncating, variant in <em>SMARCC1</em>. RTPCR analysis suggests the potential null nature of the variant attributed to nonsense-mediated decay. <em>SMARCC1</em> is extremely constrained in humans and encodes a highly conserved core chromatin remodeler, BAF155. Mice that are heterozygous for a null allele or homozygous for a hypomorphic allele develop severe NTDs in the form of exencephaly. This is the first report of <em>SMARCC1</em> mutation in humans, and it shows a critical and conserved requirement for intact BAF chromatin remodeling complex in neurulation.

<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred sixteen patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH), and 21 controls underwent polysomnography, modified sleep latency tests, and a 32-hour bed rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cutoff values on various periods that discriminate patients from controls.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>TST was longer in patients with clear-cut IH than other groups (probable IH, non-IH, and controls) and in patients with probable IH than non-IH and controls. The TST cutoff best discriminating clear-cut IH and controls was 19 hours for the 32-hour recording (sensitivity = 91.9%, specificity = 85.7%) and 12 hours (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24 hours. The 19-hour cutoff displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19-hour cutoff were overweight, had more sleep inertia, and had higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19 hours, whereas no differences were found for the 12-hour cutoff. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-hour recording in IH patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cutoff best discriminating patients from controls was 19 hours over 32 hours, allowing a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on the multiple sleep latency test were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. Ann Neurol 2018.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25143-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification was used to identify CSF proteins using samples from a well-characterized longitudinal cohort comprising patients with ALS (n = 43), the upper motor neuron variant, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS; n = 6), and cross-sectional healthy (n = 20) and disease controls (Parkinsons' disease, n = 20; ALS mimic disorders, n = 12).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25143-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Three macrophage-derived chitinases showed increased abundance in ALS: chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), and chitinase-3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2). Elevated CHI3L1 was common to ALS and PLS, whereas CHIT1 and CHI3L2 levels differed. Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1, <em>r</em> = 0.56, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; CHI3L1, <em>r</em> = 0.31; <em>p</em> = 0.028; CHI3L2, <em>r</em> = 0.29, <em>p</em> = 0.044).

CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient = 0.005 log abundance units/month, <em>p</em> = 0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.84; <em>p</em> = 0.009).

<p>Background and Purpose: This study was designed to compare the effects of
high-intensity interval training (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous
training (MOD) on functional recovery and cerebral plasticity during the first
2 weeks following cerebral ischemia. Methods: Rats were randomized as follows:
Control (n=15), SHAM (n=9), MCAO (n=13), MCAO-D1 (n=7), MOD (n=13) and HIT
(n=13). Incremental tests were performed at day 1 (D1) and 14 (D14) to identify
the running speed associated with the lactate threshold (SLT) and the maximal
speed (Smax). Functional tests were performed at D1, D7 and D14. Microglia
form, cytokines, p75NTR, KCC2 and NKCC1 expression were made at D15.
Results-HIT was more effective to improve the endurance performance than MOD
and induced a fast recovery of the impaired forelimb grip force. The Iba-1
positive cells with amoeboid form and the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine
expression were lower in HIT group, mainly in the ipsilesional hemisphere. A
p75NTR overexpression is observed on the ipsilesional side together with a
restored NKCC1/KCC2 ratio on the contralesional side. Conclusions-Low-volume
HIT based on lactate threshold appears to be more effective after cerebral
ischemia than work-matched MOD to improve aerobic fitness, grip strength and
might promote cerebral plasticity.

<p>Drawing upon a body of research on the evolution of creativity, this paper
proposes a theory of how, when, and why the forward-thinking story-telling
abilities of humans evolved, culminating in the visionary abilities of science
fiction writers. The ability to recursively chain thoughts together evolved
approximately two million years ago. Language abilities, and the ability to
shift between different modes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years
ago. Science fiction dates to at least the second Century AD. It is suggested
that well before this time, but after 100,000 years ago, and concurrent with
the evolution of a division of labour between creators and imitators there
arose a division of labour between past, present, and future thinkers.
Agent-based model research suggests there are social benefits to the evolution
of individual differences in creativity such that there is a balance between
novelty-generating creators and continuity-perpetuating imitators. A balance
between individuals focused on the past, present, and future would be expected
to yield similar adaptive benefits.

<p>Despite the decades of efforts, the choice of EEG reference is still a
debated fundamental issue. Non-neutral reference can inevitably inject the
uncontrolled temporal biases into all EEG recordings, which may influence the
spatiotemporal analysis of brain activity. A method, termed microstates,
identifying spatiotemporal EEG features as the quasi-stable topography states
in milliseconds, suggests its potential as biomarkers of neurophysiological
disease. As reference electrode standardization technique (REST) could
reconstruct an infinity reference approximately, it is a question whether REST
or the other references will be more reliable than average reference (AR) for
the microstates analysis. In this study, we design the microstate-based EEG
forward model, and apply different references for microstates analysis. The
spatial similarity between the generated and assumed cluster maps is mainly
investigated. Furthermore, the real EEG data by the parametric bootstrap method
is used to validate the performance of the references. Finally, we find that
REST is robust to recover more similar cluster maps to the assumption than AR
in the simulation, and the cluster maps between REST and AR on the real EEG
data are quite different. This study may indicate that REST contributes to
identifying more objective microstates features than AR.

<p>The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom
body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system
capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in
biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of
networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where
sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly
enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the
AL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian
plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon
current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational
model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction
of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly
learn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the
statistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological
perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of
neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical
interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.
Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the
olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine
learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are
potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few
samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise
filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network
based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.

Current myoelectric prostheses allow upper-limb amputees to regain voluntary motor control of their artificial limb by exploiting residual muscle function in the forearm. However, the over-reliance on visual cues resulting from a lack of sensory feedback is a common complaint. Recently, several groups have provided tactile feedback in upper-limb amputees by using implanted electrodes, surface nerve stimulation or sensory substitution. These approaches have led to improved function and prosthesis embodiment. Nevertheless, the provided information remains limited to a subset of the rich sensory cues available to healthy individuals. More specifically, proprioception, the sense of limb position and movement, is predominantly absent from current systems. Here we show that sensory substitution based on intraneural stimulation can deliver position feedback in real-time and in conjunction with somatotopic tactile feedback. This approach allowed two trans-radial amputees to regain high and close-to-natural remapped proprioceptive acuity, with a median joint angle reproduction accuracy of 9.1{degrees} and a median threshold to detection of passive movements of 9.5{degrees}, which was compatible with results obtained in healthy subjects. The simultaneous delivery of position information and somatotopic tactile feedback allowed both amputees to discriminate object size and compliance with high levels of accuracy (75.5%). These results demonstrate that touch information delivered via somatotopic neural stimulation and position information delivered via sensory substitution can be exploited simultaneously and efficiently by trans-radial amputees. This study paves the way towards more sophisticated bidirectional bionic limbs conveying rich, multimodal sensations.

Recently, numerous rare de novo mutations have been identified in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, despite the predicted loss-of-function nature of some of these de novo mutations, the affected individuals are heterozygous carriers, which would suggest that most of these candidate genes are haploinsufficient and/or that these mutations lead to expression of dominant-negative forms of the protein. Here, we tested this hypothesis with the gene Nuak1, recently identified as a candidate ASD gene and that we previously identified for its role in the development of cortical connectivity. We report that Nuak1 is happloinsufficient in mice in regard to its function in cortical axon branching in vitro and in vivo. Nuak1+/- mice show a combination of abnormal behavioral traits ranging from defective memory consolidation in a spatial learning task, defects in social novelty (but not social preference) and abnormal sensorimotor gating and prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nuak1 haploinsufficiency leads to defects in the development of cortical connectivity and a complex array of behavorial deficits compatible with ASD, intellectual disability and schizophrenia.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262626v1?rss=1">Network dimensionality underlies flexible representation of cognitive information</a></h4>

The functional networks in human cortex that most flexibly represent cognitive information are hubs with widespread connectivity throughout the brain. Going beyond simple hub measures, we hypothesized that the dimensionality of each network's global connectivity pattern (its global dimensionality) underlies its ability to produce highly diverse task activation patterns (its representational flexibility). Supporting our hypothesis, we report that the global dimensionality estimated during resting state correlates with the representational flexibility estimated across a variety of cognitive tasks. Demonstrating the robustness of this relationship, each network's global connectivity pattern could be used to predict its representational flexibility. Additionally, we found that the frontoparietal cognitive control network had the highest dimensionality and flexibility, and that individuals with higher network dimensionality had higher representational flexibility. Together, these findings suggest that a network's global dimensionality contributes to its ability to represent diverse cognitive information, implicating dimensionality as a network mechanism underlying flexible cognitive representation.

<p>by Micha√´l Dougoud, Laura Vinckenbosch, Rudolf P. Rohr, Louis-F√©lix Bersier, Christian Mazza</p>

The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3gE01kroZuI" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Evidence suggests disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Prior preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping prior to resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all seven patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth prior to electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation - perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Background</b>: Understanding the pathological changes underlying mild motor features of the eldery and defining a patient population with prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) are of great clinical importance. It remains unclear, however, how to accurately and specifically diagnose prodromal PD. We examined whether older adults with minimal parkinsonian motor features have nigrostriatal degeneration and Œ±-synuclein pathology consistent with prodromal PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Brain sections were obtained from older adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=21) and without a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=27) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Cases without PD were further dichotomized into no motor deficit (n=9) or minimal motor features (n-18) groups using a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed quantitative unbiased stereological analyses of dopaminergic neurons/terminals and Œ±-synuclein accumulation in the nigrostriatal system.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In all subjects with minimal motor features, there were significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons and terminals in the substantia nigra and putamen that was intermediate between subjects with no motor deficit and PD. Phosphorylated Œ±-synuclein inclusions were observed in the substantia nigra that were of similar density to what was seen in PD. Furthermore, there was greater Lewy neuritic pathology in the putamen relative to PD patients. Lastly, neurons with Œ±-synuclein inclusions displayed reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was comparable in subjects with both minimal motor features and PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Minimal motor features in older adults may represent prodromal PD and identify at risk individuals for testing putative neuroprotective interventions that could slow or prevent PD progression.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: To evaluate the outcomes one-year and longer following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in a large series of patients treated over a five-year period since introduction of this novel technique.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Methods</em>: Surgical outcomes of a consecutive series of fifty-eight patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent the surgery at our institution with at least 12-months follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Results</em>: One-year following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy 53.4% (95% confidence interval: 40.8%-65.7%) of all patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel 1). Three of nine patients became seizure free following repeat ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that 60.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6%-73.7%) of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were free of disabling seizures as compared to 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.0%-58.5%) of patients without mesial temporal sclerosis. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 scores significantly improved at the group level, few procedure-related complications were observed, and verbal memory outcome was better than historical open resection data.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Interpretation</em>: In an unselected consecutive series of patients, stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy yielded seizure-free rates for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy lower than, but comparable to, the outcomes typically associated with open temporal lobe surgery. Analogous to results from open surgery, patients without mesial temporal sclerosis fared less well. This novel procedure is an effective minimally invasive alternative to resective surgery. In the minority of patients not free of disabling seizures, laser ablation presents no barrier to additional open surgery. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

Abstract<p>GCaMP is an optogenetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor widely used for monitoring neuronal activities but the precise physiological implications of GCaMP signals remain to be further delineated among functionally distinct synapses. The <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a powerful genetic system for studying synaptic function and plasticity, consists of tonic and phasic glutamatergic and modulatory aminergic motor terminals of distinct properties. We report a first simultaneous imaging and electric recording study to directly contrast the frequency characteristics of GCaMP signals of the three synapses for physiological implications. Different GCaMP variants were applied in genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments to examine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and clearance processes underlying the GCaMP signal. Distinct mutational and drug effects on GCaMP signals indicate differential roles of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, encoded by genes including <i>paralytic</i>, <i>Shaker</i>, <i>Shab</i>, and <i>ether-a-go-go</i>, in excitability control of different motor terminals. Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling properties reflected by the characteristic frequency dependence of the synaptic GCaMP signals were determined to a large extent by differential capacity of mitochondria-powered Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms. Simultaneous focal recordings of synaptic activities further revealed that GCaMPs were ineffective in tracking the rapid dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that triggers transmitter release, especially during low-frequency activities, but more adequately reflected cytosolic residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, a major factor governing activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the vast range of GCaMP response patterns in functionally distinct synaptic types and provide relevant information for establishing basic guidelines for the physiological interpretations of pre-synaptic GCaMP signals from in situ imaging studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GCaMPs are a family of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators widely employed in monitoring neuronal circuit activities. This study employed a genetic model system to enable simultaneous recording of presynaptic GCaMP signals in three functionally distinct types of synapses side by side. The results reveal how differential control by membrane excitability and mitochondria-powered Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms shape distinct residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different synaptic boutons during repetitive firing. Our results demonstrate a wide range of GCaMP response patterns in relation to different types of synaptic transmission and thereby provide background information for proper interpretations of GCaMP signals in a variety of synaptic activities.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0021-18.2018v1?rss=1">A Neural Circuit Mechanism for the Involvements of Dopamine in Effort-Related Choices: Decay of Learned Values, Secondary Effects of Depletion, and Calculation of Temporal Difference Error</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Dopamine has been suggested to be crucially involved in effort-related choices. Key findings are that dopamine depletion (i) changed preference for a high-cost-large-reward option to a low-cost-small-reward option, (ii) but not when the large-reward option was also low-cost or the small-reward option gave no reward, (iii) while increasing the latency in all the cases but only transiently, and that (iv) antagonism of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors also specifically impaired selection of the high-cost-large-reward option. The underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that findings (i)-(iii) can be explained by the dopaminergic representation of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error, whose mechanisms have now become clarified, if (1) the synaptic strengths storing the values of actions mildly decay in time and (2) the obtained-reward-representing excitatory input to dopamine neurons increases after dopamine depletion. The former is potentially caused by background neural activity-induced weak synaptic plasticity, and the latter is assumed to occur through post-depletion increase of neural activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus, where neurons representing obtained reward exist and presumably send excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. We further show that finding (iv), which is nontrivial given the suggested distinct functions of the D1 and D2 corticostriatal pathways, can also be explained if we additionally assume a proposed mechanism of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation, in which the D1 and D2 pathways encode the values of actions with a temporal difference. These results suggest a possible circuit mechanism for the involvements of dopamine in effort-related choices, and simultaneously, provide implications for the mechanisms of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Depletion of dopamine (DA) or antagonism of either of the two major types of DA receptors was all shown to impair effortful actions to obtain large rewards while sparing reward-seeking or effort-exertion per se. DA has thus been proposed to play specific roles in reward-oriented effort exertion. However, underlying neural circuit mechanisms, and their relations with another popular role of DA, encoding of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error (TD-RPE), remain unclear. We show that the experimental results suggesting DA's involvements in effort-related choices can be consistently explained by the DA's encoding of TD-RPE if assuming a mild decay of learned values, an increase of obtained-reward-representing input to DA neurons as a secondary effect of DA depletion, and a proposed circuit mechanism of TD-RPE calculation.</p>

<p>EEG signals are records of nonlinear solitary waves in human brains. The
waves have several types (e.g., a, b, g, q, d) in response to different levels
of consciousness. They are classified into two groups: Group-1 consists of
complex storm-like waves (a, b, and g); Group-2 is composed of simple
quasilinear waves (q and d). In order to elucidate the mechanism of EEG wave
formation and propagation, this paper extends the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of
Plasma Brain Dynamics (PBD) to a set of two-fluid, self-similar, nonlinear
solitary wave equations. Numerical simulations are performed for different EEG
signals. Main results include: (1) The excitation and propagation of the EEG
wave packets are dependent of electric and magnetic fields, brain aqua-ions,
electron and ion temperatures, masses, and their initial fluid speeds; (2)
Group-1 complex waves contain three ingredients: the high-frequency
ion-acoustic (IA) mode, the intermediate-frequency lower-hybrid (LH) mode, and
the low-frequency ion-cyclotron (IC) mode; (3) Group-2 simple waves fall within
the IA band, featured by one or a combination of the three envelopes:
sinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky/bipolar. The study proposes an alternative
model to Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) by suggesting that the formation and
propagation of the nonlinear solitary EEG waves in the brain have the same
mechanism as that of the waves in space plasmas

We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70‚Äì120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions. Since rodents often breathe at delta and theta frequencies, we caution that previous studies on delta and theta power and their cross-regional synchrony, as well as on delta‚Äìgamma and theta‚Äìgamma coupling, may have detected the respiration-entrained rhythm and respiration‚Äìgamma coupling.

Matt et¬†al. introduce Œ±-actinin as a critical postsynaptic docking protein for PSD-95 and AMPARs. They found that disruption of the PSD-95-Œ±-actinin interaction by point-mutating the essential residues on either protein leads to reduced synaptic localization of PSD-95 and AMPARs.

<p>by James X. Sun, Yuting He, Eric Sanford, Meagan Montesion, Garrett M. Frampton, St√©phane Vignot, Jean-Charles Soria, Jeffrey S. Ross, Vincent A. Miller, Phil J. Stephens, Doron Lipson, Roman Yelensky</p>

A key constraint in genomic testing in oncology is that matched normal specimens are not commonly obtained in clinical practice. Thus, while well-characterized genomic alterations do not require normal tissue for interpretation, a significant number of alterations will be unknown in whether they are germline or somatic, in the absence of a matched normal control. We introduce SGZ (somatic-germline-zygosity), a computational method for predicting somatic vs. germline origin and homozygous vs. heterozygous or sub-clonal state of variants identified from deep massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of cancer specimens. The method does not require a patient matched normal control, enabling broad application in clinical research. SGZ predicts the somatic vs. germline status of each alteration identified by modeling the alteration‚Äôs allele frequency (AF), taking into account the tumor content, tumor ploidy, and the local copy number. Accuracy of the prediction depends on the depth of sequencing and copy number model fit, which are achieved in our clinical assay by sequencing to high depth (&gt;500x) using MPS, covering 394 cancer-related genes and over 3,500 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Calls are made using a statistic based on read depth and local variability of SNP AF. To validate the method, we first evaluated performance on samples from 30 lung and colon cancer patients, where we sequenced tumors and matched normal tissue. We examined predictions for 17 somatic hotspot mutations and 20 common germline SNPs in 20,182 clinical cancer specimens. To assess the impact of stromal admixture, we examined three cell lines, which were titrated with their matched normal to six levels (10‚Äì75%). Overall, predictions were made in 85% of cases, with 95‚Äì99% of variants predicted correctly, a significantly superior performance compared to a basic approach based on AF alone. We then applied the SGZ method to the COSMIC database of known somatic variants in cancer and found &gt;50 that are in fact more likely to be germline.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/134RQp414fk" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTS), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP)-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal <i>in vivo</i>.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Recent studies have revealed the important impact of the central medial nucleus of thalamus (CeM) on control of arousal, yet the key ion channel that regulates its excitability has not been well studied. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings from acute brain slices to demonstrate for the first time that T-channels play an important supportive role in regulation of excitability of rat CeM neurons. Additionally, we found that T-channels not only play a major role in shaping the output of the CeM, but also that activity is strongly regulated by cytosolic adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP). Hence, ATP may be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels can functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1588?rss=1">Regulation of Lateral Hypothalamic Orexin Activity by Local GABAergic Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Orexin (also known as hypocretin) neurons are considered a key component of the ascending arousal system. They are active during wakefulness, at which time they drive and maintain arousal, and are silent during sleep. Their activity is controlled by long-range inputs from many sources, as well as by more short-range inputs, including from presumptive GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical region (LH/PF). To characterize local GABAergic input to orexin neurons, we used channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We expressed channelrhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons (Vgat<sup>+</sup>) in the LH/PF and recorded from genetically identified surrounding orexin neurons (LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx). We performed all experiments in mice of either sex. Photostimulation of LH/PF GABAergic neurons inhibited the firing of orexin neurons through the release of GABA, evoking GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated IPSCs in orexin neurons. These photo-evoked IPSCs were maintained in the presence of TTX, indicating direct connectivity. Carbachol inhibited LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input through muscarinic receptors. By contrast, application of orexin was without effect on LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input, whereas dynorphin, another peptide produced by orexin neurons, inhibited LH/PF<sup>Vgat</sup> -&gt; Orx input through -opioid receptors. Our results demonstrate that orexin neurons are under inhibitory control by local GABAergic neurons and that this input is depressed by cholinergic signaling, unaffected by orexin and inhibited by dynorphin. We propose that local release of dynorphin may, via collaterals, provides a positive feedback to orexin neurons and that, during wakefulness, orexin neurons may be disinhibited by acetylcholine and by their own release of dynorphin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral hypothalamus contains important wake-promoting cell populations, including orexin-producing neurons. Intermingled with the orexin neurons, there are other cell populations that selectively discharge during nonrapid eye movement or rapid eye movement sleep. Some of these sleep-active neurons release GABA and are thought to inhibit wake-active neurons during rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep. However, this hypothesis had not been tested. Here we show that orexin neurons are inhibited by a local GABAergic input. We propose that this local GABAergic input inhibits orexin neurons during sleep but that, during wakefulness, this input is depressed, possibly through cholinergically mediated disinhibition and/or by release of dynorphin from orexin neurons themselves.</p>

<p>Bergmann glia facilitate granule neuron migration during development and maintain the cerebellar organization and functional integrity. At present, molecular control of Bergmann glia specification from cerebellar radial glia is not fully understood. In this report, we show that ZEB2 (aka, SIP1 or ZFHX1B), a Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome-associated transcriptional regulator, is highly expressed in Bergmann glia, but hardly detectable in astrocytes in the cerebellum. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia exhibit severe deficits in Bergmann glia specification, and develop cerebellar cortical lamination dysgenesis and locomotion defects. In developing <i>Zeb2</i>-mutant cerebella, inward migration of granule neuron progenitors is compromised, the proliferation of glial precursors is reduced, and radial glia fail to differentiate into Bergmann glia in the Purkinje cell layer. In contrast, <i>Zeb2</i> ablation in granule neuron precursors or oligodendrocyte progenitors does not affect Bergmann glia formation, despite myelination deficits caused by <i>Zeb2</i> mutation in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Transcriptome profiling identified that ZEB2 regulates a set of Bergmann glia-related genes and FGF, NOTCH, and TGFŒ≤/BMP signaling pathway components. Our data reveal that ZEB2 acts as an integral regulator of Bergmann glia formation ensuring maintenance of cerebellar integrity, suggesting that ZEB2 dysfunction in Bergmann gliogenesis might contribute to motor deficits in Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bergmann glia are essential for proper cerebellar organization and functional circuitry, however, the molecular mechanisms that control the specification of Bergmann glia remain elusive. Here, we show that transcriptional factor ZEB2 is highly expressed in mature Bergmann glia, but not in cerebellar astrocytes. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia, but not oligodendrocyte progenitors or granular neuron progenitors, exhibit severe defects in Bergmann glia formation. The orderly radial scaffolding formed by Bergmann glial fibers critical for cerebellar lamination was not established in <i>Zeb2</i> mutants, displaying motor behavior deficits. This finding demonstrates a previously unrecognized critical role for ZEB2 in Bergmann glia specification, and points to an important contribution of ZEB2 dysfunction to cerebellar motor disorders in Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome.</p>

<p>Recent models posit that bursts of locus ceruleus (LC) activity amplify neural gain such that limited attention and encoding resources focus even more on prioritized mental representations under arousal. Here, we tested this hypothesis in human males and females using fMRI, neuromelanin MRI, and pupil dilation, a biomarker of arousal and LC activity. During scanning, participants performed a monetary incentive encoding task in which threat of punishment motivated them to prioritize encoding of scene images over superimposed objects. Threat of punishment elicited arousal and selectively enhanced memory for goal-relevant scenes. Furthermore, trial-level pupil dilations predicted better scene memory under threat, but were not related to object memory outcomes. fMRI analyses revealed that greater threat-evoked pupil dilations were positively associated with greater scene encoding activity in LC and parahippocampal cortex, a region specialized to process scene information. Across participants, this pattern of LC engagement for goal-relevant encoding was correlated with neuromelanin signal intensity, providing the first evidence that LC structure relates to its activation pattern during cognitive processing. Threat also reduced dynamic functional connectivity between high-priority (parahippocampal place area) and lower-priority (lateral occipital cortex) category-selective visual cortex in ways that predicted increased memory selectivity. Together, these findings support the idea that, under arousal, LC activity selectively strengthens prioritized memory representations by modulating local and functional network-level patterns of information processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adaptive behavior relies on the ability to select and store important information amid distraction. Prioritizing encoding of task-relevant inputs is especially critical in threatening or arousing situations, when forming these memories is essential for avoiding danger in the future. However, little is known about the arousal mechanisms that support such memory selectivity. Using fMRI, neuromelanin MRI, and pupil measures, we demonstrate that locus ceruleus (LC) activity amplifies neural gain such that limited encoding resources focus even more on prioritized mental representations under arousal. For the first time, we also show that LC structure relates to its involvement in threat-related encoding processes. These results shed new light on the brain mechanisms by which we process important information when it is most needed.</p>

<p>Forming valid predictions about the environment is crucial to survival. However, whether humans are able to form valid predictions about natural stimuli based on their temporal statistical regularities remains unknown. Here, we presented subjects with tone sequences with pitch fluctuations that, over time, capture long-range temporal dependence structures prevalent in natural stimuli. We found that subjects were able to exploit such naturalistic statistical regularities to make valid predictions about upcoming items in a sequence. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings revealed that slow, arrhythmic cortical dynamics tracked the evolving pitch sequence over time such that neural activity at a given moment was influenced by the pitch of up to seven previous tones. Importantly, such history integration contained in neural activity predicted the expected pitch of the upcoming tone, providing a concrete computational mechanism for prediction. These results establish humans' ability to make valid predictions based on temporal regularities inherent in naturalistic stimuli and further reveal the neural mechanisms underlying such predictive computation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain predicts upcoming events in the environment. To date, this question has primarily been addressed in experiments using relatively simple stimulus sequences. Here, we studied predictive processing in the human brain using auditory tone sequences that exhibit temporal statistical regularities similar to those found in natural stimuli. We observed that humans are able to form valid predictions based on such complex temporal statistical regularities. We further show that neural response to a given tone in the sequence reflects integration over the preceding tone sequence and that this history dependence forms the foundation for prediction. These findings deepen our understanding of how humans form predictions in an ecologically valid environment.</p>

<p>In primate retina, "red-green" color coding is initiated when signals originating in long (L) and middle (M) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors interact antagonistically. The center-surround receptive field of "midget" ganglion cells provides the neural substrate for L versus M cone-opponent interaction, but the underlying circuitry remains unsettled, centering around the longstanding question of whether specialized cone wiring is present. To address this question, we measured the strength, sign, and spatial tuning of L- and M-cone input to midget receptive fields in the peripheral retina of macaque primates of either sex. Consistent with previous work, cone opponency arose when one of the cone types showed a stronger connection to the receptive field center than to the surround. We implemented a difference-of-Gaussians spatial receptive field model, incorporating known biology of the midget circuit, to test whether physiological responses we observed in real cells could be captured entirely by anatomical nonselectivity. When this model sampled nonselectively from a realistic cone mosaic, it accurately reproduced key features of a cone-opponent receptive field structure, and predicted both the variability and strength of cone opponency across the retina. The model introduced here is consistent with abundant anatomical evidence for nonselective wiring, explains both local and global properties of the midget population, and supports a role in their multiplexing of spatial and color information. It provides a neural basis for human chromatic sensitivity across the visual field, as well as the maintenance of normal color vision despite significant variability in the relative number of L and M cones across individuals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Red-green color vision is a hallmark of the human and nonhuman primate that starts in the retina with the presence of long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptor types. Understanding the underlying retinal mechanism for color opponency has focused on the broad question of whether this characteristic can emerge from nonselective wiring, or whether complex cone-type-specific wiring must be invoked. We provide experimental and modeling support for the hypothesis that nonselective connectivity is sufficient to produce the range of red-green color opponency observed in midget ganglion cells across the retina. Our nonselective model reproduces the diversity of physiological responses of midget cells while also accounting for systematic changes in color sensitivity across the visual field.</p>

<p>Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and attention are distinct yet interrelated processes. While both require selection of information across the visual field, memory additionally requires the maintenance of information across time and distraction. VSTM recruits areas within human (male and female) dorsal and ventral parietal cortex that are also implicated in spatial selection; therefore, it is important to determine whether overlapping activation might reflect shared attentional demands. Here, identical stimuli and controlled sustained attention across both tasks were used to ask whether fMRI signal amplitude, functional connectivity, and contralateral visual field bias reflect memory-specific task demands. While attention and VSTM activated similar cortical areas, BOLD amplitude and functional connectivity in parietal cortex differentiated the two tasks. Relative to attention, VSTM increased BOLD amplitude in dorsal parietal cortex and decreased BOLD amplitude in the angular gyrus. Additionally, the tasks differentially modulated parietal functional connectivity. Contrasting VSTM and attention, intraparietal sulcus (IPS) 1‚Äì2 were more strongly connected with anterior frontoparietal areas and more weakly connected with posterior regions. This divergence between tasks demonstrates that parietal activation reflects memory-specific functions and consequently modulates functional connectivity across the cortex. In contrast, both tasks demonstrated hemispheric asymmetries for spatial processing, exhibiting a stronger contralateral visual field bias in the left versus the right hemisphere across tasks, suggesting that asymmetries are characteristic of a shared selection process in IPS. These results demonstrate that parietal activity and patterns of functional connectivity distinguish VSTM from more general attention processes, establishing a central role of the parietal cortex in maintaining visual information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual short-term memory (VSTM) and attention are distinct yet interrelated processes. Cognitive mechanisms and neural activity underlying these tasks show a large degree of overlap. To examine whether activity within the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) reflects object maintenance across distraction or sustained attention per se, it is necessary to control for attentional demands inherent in VSTM tasks. We demonstrate that activity in PPC reflects VSTM demands even after controlling for attention; remembering items across distraction modulates relationships between parietal and other areas differently than during periods of sustained attention. Our study fills a gap in the literature by directly comparing and controlling for overlap between visual attention and VSTM tasks.</p>

<p>As key functional units in neural circuits, different types of neuronal synapses play distinct roles in brain information processing, learning, and memory. Synaptic abnormalities are believed to underlie various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, by combining cryo-electron tomography and cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy, we distinguished intact excitatory and inhibitory synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons, and visualized the <i>in situ</i> 3D organization of synaptic organelles and macromolecules in their native state. Quantitative analyses of &gt;100 synaptic tomograms reveal that excitatory synapses contain a mesh-like postsynaptic density (PSD) with thickness ranging from 20 to 50 nm. In contrast, the PSD in inhibitory synapses assumes a thin sheet-like structure ~12 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. On the presynaptic side, spherical synaptic vesicles (SVs) of 25‚Äì60 nm diameter and discus-shaped ellipsoidal SVs of various sizes coexist in both synaptic types, with more ellipsoidal ones in inhibitory synapses. High-resolution tomograms obtained using a Volta phase plate and electron filtering and counting reveal glutamate receptor-like and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-like structures that interact with putative scaffolding and adhesion molecules, reflecting details of receptor anchoring and PSD organization. These results provide an updated view of the ultrastructure of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and demonstrate the potential of our approach to gain insight into the organizational principles of cellular architecture underlying distinct synaptic functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To understand functional properties of neuronal synapses, it is desirable to analyze their structure at molecular resolution. We have developed an integrative approach combining cryo-electron tomography and correlative fluorescence microscopy to visualize 3D ultrastructural features of intact excitatory and inhibitory synapses in their native state. Our approach shows that inhibitory synapses contain uniform thin sheet-like postsynaptic densities (PSDs), while excitatory synapses contain previously known mesh-like PSDs. We discovered "discus-shaped" ellipsoidal synaptic vesicles, and their distributions along with regular spherical vesicles in synaptic types are characterized. High-resolution tomograms further allowed identification of putative neurotransmitter receptors and their heterogeneous interaction with synaptic scaffolding proteins. The specificity and resolution of our approach enables precise <i>in situ</i> analysis of ultrastructural organization underlying distinct synaptic functions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1482?rss=1">Perceptual Surprise Improves Action Stopping by Nonselectively Suppressing Motor Activity via a Neural Mechanism for Motor Inhibition</a></h4>

<p>Motor inhibition is a cognitive control ability that allows humans to stop actions rapidly even after initiation. Understanding and improving motor inhibition could benefit adaptive behavior in both health and disease. We recently found that presenting surprising, task-unrelated sounds when stopping is necessary improves the likelihood of successful stopping. In the current study, we investigated the neural underpinnings of this effect. Specifically, we tested whether surprise-related stopping improvements are due to a genuine increase in motor inhibition. In Experiment 1, we measured motor inhibition in primary motor cortex of male and female humans by quantifying corticospinal excitability (CSE) via transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography during a hybrid surprise‚ÄìGo/NoGo task. Consistent with prior studies of motor inhibition, successful stopping was accompanied by nonselective suppression of CSE; that is, CSE was suppressed even in task-unrelated motor effectors. Importantly, unexpected sounds significantly increased this motor-system inhibition to a degree that was directly related to behavioral improvements in stopping. In Experiment 2, we then used scalp encephalography to investigate whether unexpected sounds increase motor-inhibition-related activity in the CNS. We used an independent stop-signal localizer task to identify a well characterized frontocentral low-frequency EEG component that indexes motor inhibition. We then investigated the activity of this component in the surprise‚ÄìGo/NoGo task. Consistent with Experiment 1, this signature of motor inhibition was indeed increased when NoGo signals were followed by unexpected sounds. Together, these experiments provide converging evidence suggesting that unexpected events improve motor inhibition by automatically triggering inhibitory control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability to stop ongoing actions rapidly allows humans to adapt their behavior flexibly and rapidly. Action stopping is important in daily life (e.g., stopping to cross the street when a car approaches) and is severely impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, finding ways to improve action stopping could aid adaptive behaviors in health and disease. Our current study shows that presenting unexpected sounds in stopping situations facilitates successful stopping. This improvement is specifically due to a surprise-related increase in a neural mechanism for motor inhibition, which rapidly suppresses the excitability of the motor system after unexpected events. These findings suggest a tight interaction between the neural systems for surprise processing and motor inhibition and yield a promising avenue for future research.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1472?rss=1">Retrosplenial Cortex Indexes Stability beyond the Spatial Domain</a></h4>

<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is highly responsive to landmarks in the environment that remain fixed in a permanent location, and this has been linked with its known involvement in scene and spatial processing. However, it is unclear whether RSC representations of permanence are a purely spatial phenomenon or whether they extend into behavioral and conceptual domains. To test this, during functional MRI scanning, we had people (males and females) read three different types of sentences that described either something permanent or transient. The first two sentence types were imageable, with a focus either on a spatial landmark or on an action. The third type of sentence involved non-imageable abstract concepts. We found that, in addition to being more active for sentences describing landmarks with a permanent location in space, RSC was also significantly engaged by sentences describing stable and consistent behaviors or actions, as long as they were rooted within a concrete imageable setting. RSC was not responsive to abstract concepts, even those that embodied the notion of stability. Similarly, it was not engaged by imageable sentences with transient contents. In contrast, parahippocampal cortex was more engaged by imageable sentences describing landmarks, whereas the hippocampus was active for all imageable sentences. In addition, for imageable sentences describing permanence, there was bidirectional functional coupling between RSC and these medial temporal lobe structures. It appears, therefore, that RSC-mediated permanence representations could be helpful for more than spatially mapping environments and may also provide information about the reliability of events occurring within them.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is known to process information about landmarks in the environment that have a fixed, permanent location. Here we tested whether this permanence response was apparent beyond the spatial domain, which could have implications for understanding the role of the RSC more widely across cognition. We found that the RSC was engaged not only by permanent landmarks but also by stable and consistent actions. It was not responsive to transient landmarks or actions or to abstract concepts, even those that embodied the notion of stability. We conclude that the RSC might do more than help to map spatial environments, by possibly also providing information about the reliability of events occurring within them.</p>

<p>Abuse rates for inhalants among adolescents continue to be high, yet preclinical models for studying mechanisms underlying inhalant abuse remain limited. Our laboratory has previously shown that, in male rats, an acute binge-like exposure to toluene vapor that mimics human solvent abuse modifies the intrinsic excitability of mPFC pyramidal neurons projecting to the NAc. These changes showed region (infralimbic; IL vs prelimbic; PRL), layer (shallow; 2/3 vs deep; 5/6), target (core vs shell), and age (adolescent vs adult) dependent differences (Wayman and Woodward, 2017). To expand these findings using reward-based models that may better mimic human drug abuse, we used whole-cell electrophysiology and drug receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs to examine changes in neuronal function and behavior in rats showing a conditioned place preference (CPP) to toluene. Repeated pairings of adolescent rats to binge concentrations of toluene vapor previously shown to enhance dopamine release in reward-sensitive areas of the brain produced CPP that persisted for 7 but not 30 d. Toluene-induced CPP was associated with increased excitability of IL5/6 mPFC neurons projecting to the core of the NAc and reduced excitability of those projecting to the NAc shell. No changes in PRL-NAc-projecting neurons were found in toluene-CPP rats. Chemogenetic reversal of the toluene-induced decrease in IL5/6-NAc shell neurons blocked the expression of toluene-induced CPP while manipulating IL5/6-NAc core neuron activity had no effect. These data reveal that alterations in selective mPFC-NAc pathways are required for expression of toluene-induced CPP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disturbed physiology of pyramidal neurons projecting from the mPFC to the NAc has been shown to have different roles in drug-seeking behaviors for a number of drugs (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol, heroin). Here, we report that rats repeatedly exposed to the volatile organic solvent toluene, a member of the class of abused inhalants often used for intoxicating purposes by adolescents, induces a preference for the drug-paired environment that is accompanied by altered physiology of a specific population of NAc-projecting mPFC neurons. Chemogenetic correction of this deficit before testing prevented expression of drug preference. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of corticolimbic circuitry in mediating the rewarding properties of abused inhalants.</p>

<p>The mouse olfactory bulb (OB) features continued, activity-dependent integration of adult-born neurons, providing a robust model with which to examine mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain. We previously reported that local OB interneurons secrete the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in an activity-dependent manner onto adult-born granule neurons and that local CRH signaling promotes expression of synaptic machinery in the bulb. This effect is mediated via activation of the CRH receptor 1 (<i>CRHR1</i>), which is developmentally regulated during adult-born neuron maturation. CRHR1 is a G<sub>S</sub>-protein-coupled receptor that activates CREB-dependent transcription in the presence of CRH. Therefore, we hypothesized that locally secreted CRH activates CRHR1 to initiate circuit plasticity programs. To identify such programs, we profiled gene expression changes associated with CRHR1 activity in adult-born neurons of the OB. Here, we show that CRHR1 activity influences expression of the brain-specific Homeobox-containing transcription factor POU Class 6 Homeobox 1 (<i>POU6f1</i>). To elucidate the contributions of <i>POU6f1</i> toward activity-dependent circuit remodeling, we targeted CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons in male and female mice for cell-type-specific manipulation of <i>POU6f1</i> expression. Whereas loss of <i>POU6f1</i> in CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons resulted in reduced dendritic complexity and decreased synaptic connectivity, overexpression of <i>POU6f1</i> in CRHR1<sup>+</sup> neurons promoted dendritic outgrowth and branching and influenced synaptic function. Together, these findings suggest that the transcriptional program directed by <i>POU6f1</i> downstream of local CRH signaling in adult-born neurons influences circuit dynamics in response to activity-dependent peptide signaling in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elucidating mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain is helpful for devising strategies to understand and treat neurodegeneration. Circuit plasticity in the adult mouse olfactory bulb is exemplified by both continued cell integration and synaptogenesis. We previously reported that these processes are influenced by local neuropeptide signaling in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we show that local corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling induces dynamic gene expression changes in CRH receptor expressing adult-born neurons, including altered expression of the transcription factor <i>POU6f1</i>. We further show that <i>POU6f1</i> is necessary for proper dendrite specification and patterning, as well as synapse development and function in adult-born neurons. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which peptide signaling modulates adult brain circuit plasticity.</p>

<p>Human primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for producing dexterous hand movements. Although distinct subpopulations of neurons are activated during single-finger movements, it remains unknown whether M1 also represents sequences of multiple finger movements. Using novel multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis techniques and combining evidence from both 3T and 7T fMRI data, we found that after 5 d of intense practice, premotor and parietal areas encoded the different movement sequences. There was little or no evidence for a sequence representation in M1. Instead, activity patterns in M1 could be fully explained by a linear combination of patterns for the constituent individual finger movements, with the strongest weight on the first finger of the sequence. Using passive replay of sequences, we show that this first-finger effect is due to neuronal processes involved in the active execution, rather than to a hemodynamic nonlinearity. These results suggest that M1 receives increased input from areas with sequence representations at the initiation of a sequence, but that M1 activity itself relates to the execution of component finger presses only. These results improve our understanding of the representation of finger sequences in the human neocortex after short-term training and provide important methodological advances for the study of long-term skill development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There is clear evidence that human primary motor cortex (M1) is essential for producing individuated finger movements, such as pressing a button. Over and above its involvement in movement execution, it is less clear whether M1 also plays a role in learning and controlling sequences of multiple finger movements, such as when playing the piano. Using cutting-edge multivariate fMRI analysis and carefully controlled experiments, we demonstrate here that, while premotor areas clearly show a sequence representation, activity patterns in M1 can be fully explained from the patterns for individual finger movements. The results provide important new insights into the interplay of M1 and premotor cortex for learning of sequential movements.</p>

<p>For animals to survive, they must reliably predict during foraging which substances are suitable for consumption. Despite extensive study, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying such adaptive behavior remain poorly understood. Here, using a tastant (sucrose/quinine)-reinforced "go/no-go" task in male and female mice, we examined the anatomical and functional connectivity of the circuit linking the insular cortex (IC) to the central amygdala (CeA) and the role of this circuit in the establishment of appropriate behavioral responses. Using anatomic tracing approaches combined with optogenetics-assisted circuit mapping, we found that the gustatory region of the IC sends direct excitatory projections to the lateral division of the CeA (CeL), making monosynaptic excitatory connections with distinct populations of CeL neurons. Specific inhibition of neurotransmitter release from the CeL-projecting IC neurons prevented mice from acquiring the "no-go" response, and impaired the "go" responses in the go/no-go task. Furthermore, selective activation of the IC‚ÄìCeL pathway with optogenetics drove unconditioned lick suppression in thirsty animals, induced aversive responses, and was sufficient to instruct conditioned action suppression in response to a cue predicting the optogenetic activation. These results indicate that activities in the IC‚ÄìCeL circuit are critical for establishing taste-reinforced behavioral responses, including avoidance responses to an aversive tastant, and are sufficient to drive learning of anticipatory avoidance. Our findings suggest that the IC‚ÄìCeL circuit plays an important role in guiding appropriate choices during foraging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An animal's ability to predict which substances are suitable for consumption and then produce an appropriate action to those substances is critical for survival. Here we found that activity in the circuit that links the insular cortex (IC) to the central amygdala (CeA) is necessary for establishing appropriate behavioral responses to taste-predicting cues. This neural circuit seems to be particularly tuned to avoid an unpleasant tastant, and is also sufficient to drive learning of such avoidance responses. These results suggest that the IC‚ÄìCeA circuit is critical for generating appropriate behavioral responses during foraging when facing different choices.</p>

<p>Poor response and high relapse rates remain problematic in the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Although mechanisms of pharmacotherapies are intensely studied, little is known about mechanisms of behavioral therapy that could inform improved treatments. We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extinction learning as a behavioral intervention modeling exposure therapy in rats. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction is necessary for its therapeutic effects. The inhibitory Gi-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug CaMKIIŒ±-hM4Di was expressed in vmPFC before administering chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). vmPFC projection neurons were then inhibited during extinction treatment by administering clozapine-<i>N</i>-oxide. Coping behavior and cognitive flexibility were assessed 24 h later on the shock-probe defensive burying test and attentional set-shifting test, respectively. Replicating previous results, extinction reversed the CUS-induced deficits in coping behavior and cognitive flexibility. Inhibiting vmPFC during extinction blocked these therapeutic effects. Further, increasing vmPFC activity with the excitatory Gq-coupled designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug hM3Dq 24 h before testing was sufficient to reverse the CUS-induced deficits. CUS reduced mPFC responsivity, assessed by measuring afferent-evoked field potentials in the mPFC, and this reduction was reversed by extinction treatment 24 h before testing. These results demonstrate the necessity of vmPFC activity in the therapeutic effects of extinction as a model of exposure therapy, and suggest that increased vmPFC activity induced by extinction is sufficient to produce lasting plastic changes that underlie its beneficial effects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stress-related psychiatric disorders remain poorly treated. Psychotherapies can be effective, but their mechanisms remain unknown, hindering progress toward improved treatment. We used a rat model of behavioral therapy to identify potential targets for enhancing treatment. Fear extinction as a therapeutic behavioral intervention reversed stress-induced cognitive dysfunction and passive coping in rats, modeling components of stress-related psychiatric disease. Extinction also reversed stress-induced attenuation of mPFC responsivity. The therapeutic effects were prevented by blocking activity of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC during extinction, and were mimicked by inducing activity in lieu of extinction. Thus, activity and plasticity in the mPFC underlie the beneficial effects of extinction on cognitive flexibility and coping behavior compromised by stress, and could be targets to enhance behavioral therapy.</p>

<p>Standard brain stimulation protocols modify human motor cortex excitability by modulating the gain of the activated corticospinal pathways. However, the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract requires also the recruitment of additional neurons to increase the net corticospinal output. For this purpose, we investigated a novel protocol based on brain state-dependent paired associative stimulation.</p>
<p>Motor imagery (MI)-related electroencephalography was recorded in healthy males and females for brain state-dependent control of both cortical and peripheral stimulation in a brain‚Äìmachine interface environment. State-dependency was investigated with concurrent, delayed, and independent stimulation relative to the MI task. Specifically, sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the Œ≤-band (16‚Äì22 Hz) triggered peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening by a robotic orthosis and transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation, either synchronously or subsequently. These MI-related paradigms were compared with paired cortical and peripheral input applied independent of the brain state. Cortical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in corticospinal excitability only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These gains were resistant to a depotentiation task, revealed a nonlinear evolution of plasticity, and were mediated via the recruitment of additional corticospinal neurons rather than via synchronization of neuronal firing. Recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways may be achieved when cortical and peripheral inputs are applied concurrently, and during Œ≤-ERD. These findings resemble a gating mechanism and are potentially important for developing closed-loop brain stimulation for the treatment of hand paralysis following lesions of the corticospinal tract.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity state of the motor system influences the excitability of corticospinal pathways to external input. State-dependent interventions harness this property to increase the connectivity between motor cortex and muscles. These stimulation protocols modulate the gain of the activated pathways, but not the overall corticospinal recruitment. In this study, a brain‚Äìmachine interface paired peripheral stimulation through passive hand opening with transcranial magnetic stimulation to the respective cortical motor representation during volitional Œ≤-band desynchronization. Cortical stimulation resulted in the recruitment of additional corticospinal pathways, but only when applied brain state-dependently and synchronously to peripheral input. These effects resemble a gating mechanism and may be important for the restoration of motor function following lesions of the corticospinal tract.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1383?rss=1">Role of Purinergic Receptor P2Y1 in Spatiotemporal Ca2+ Dynamics in Astrocytes</a></h4>

<p>Fine processes of astrocytes enwrap synapses and are well positioned to sense neuronal information via synaptic transmission. In rodents, astrocyte processes sense synaptic transmission via Gq-protein coupled receptors (GqPCR), including the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R), to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Astrocytes display numerous spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals; however, it is not clear whether such signals are due to local synaptic transmission and/or in what timeframe astrocytes sense local synaptic transmission. To ask whether GqPCRs mediate microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we engineered mice (both sexes) to specifically overexpress P2Y1Rs in astrocytes, and we visualized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals via a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6f, in astrocytes from adult mice. Astrocytes overexpressing P2Y1Rs showed significantly larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to exogenously applied ligand and to repetitive electrical stimulation of axons compared with controls. However, we found no evidence of increased microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Instead, Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves appeared and propagated to occupy areas that were up to 80-fold larger than microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves accounted for only 2% of total Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, but they were 1.9-fold larger and 2.9-fold longer in duration than microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at processes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves did not require action potentials for their generation and occurred in a probenecid-sensitive manner, indicating that the endogenous ligand for P2Y1R is elevated independently of synaptic transmission. Our data suggest that spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occur independently of P2Y1R activation and that astrocytes may not encode neuronal information in response to synaptic transmission at a point source of neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are thought to enwrap synapses with their processes to receive neuronal information via Gq-protein coupled receptors (GqPCRs). Astrocyte processes display numerous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that occur spontaneously. To determine whether GqPCRs play a role in microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the timeframe in which astrocytes sense neuronal information, we engineered mice whose astrocytes specifically overexpress the P2Y1 receptor, a major GqPCR in astrocytes. We found that overexpression of P2Y1 receptors in astrocytes did not increase microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocyte processes but caused Ca<sup>2+</sup> wavelike signals. Our data indicate that spontaneous microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do not require activation of P2Y1 receptors.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1366?rss=1">Proliferating NG2-Cell-Dependent Angiogenesis and Scar Formation Alter Axon Growth and Functional Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a centralized fibrotic scar surrounded by a reactive glial scar at the lesion site. The origin of these scars is thought to be perivascular cells entering lesions on ingrowing blood vessels and reactive astrocytes, respectively. However, two NG2-expressing cell populations, pericytes and glia, may also influence scar formation. In the periphery, new blood vessel growth requires proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes; if this were also true in the CNS, then the fibrotic scar would depend on dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes. NG2<sup>+</sup> glial cells (also called oligodendrocyte progenitors or polydendrocytes) also proliferate after SCI and accumulate in large numbers among astrocytes in the glial scar. Their effect there, if any, is unknown. We show that proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes and glia largely segregate into the fibrotic and glial scars, respectively; therefore, we used a thymidine kinase/ganciclovir paradigm to ablate both dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> cell populations to determine whether either scar was altered. Results reveal that loss of proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes in the lesion prevented intralesion angiogenesis and completely abolished the fibrotic scar. The glial scar was also altered in the absence of acutely dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> cells, displaying discontinuous borders and significantly reduced GFAP density. Collectively, these changes enhanced edema, prolonged hemorrhage, and impaired forelimb functional recovery. Interestingly, after halting GCV at 14 d postinjury, scar elements and vessels entered the lesions over the next 7 d, as did large numbers of axons that were not present in controls. Collectively, these data reveal that acutely dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes and glia play fundamental roles in post-SCI tissue remodeling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by formation of astrocytic and fibrotic scars, both of which are necessary for lesion repair. NG2<sup>+</sup> cells may influence both scar-forming processes. This study used a novel transgenic mouse paradigm to ablate proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> cells after SCI to better understand their role in repair. For the first time, our data show that dividing NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes are required for post-SCI angiogenesis, which in turn is needed for fibrotic scar formation. Moreover, loss of cycling NG2<sup>+</sup> glia and pericytes caused significant multicellular tissue changes, including altered astrocyte responses and impaired functional recovery. This work reveals previously unknown ways in which proliferating NG2<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to endogenous repair after SCI.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1351?rss=1">Intraneural Injection of ATP Stimulates Regeneration of Primary Sensory Axons in the Spinal Cord</a></h4>

<p>Injury to the peripheral axons of sensory neurons strongly enhances the regeneration of their central axons in the spinal cord. It remains unclear on what molecules that initiate such conditioning effect. Because ATP is released extracellularly by nerve and other tissue injury, we hypothesize that injection of ATP into a peripheral nerve might mimic the stimulatory effect of nerve injury on the regenerative state of the primary sensory neurons. We found that a single injection of 6 Œºl of 150 Œºm ATP into female rat sciatic nerve quadrupled the number of axons growing into a lesion epicenter in spinal cord after a concomitant dorsal column transection. A second boost ATP injection 1 week after the first one markedly reinforced the stimulatory effect of a single injection. Single ATP injection increased expression of phospho-STAT3 and GAP43, two markers of regenerative activity, in sensory neurons. Double ATP injections sustained the activation of phospho-STAT3 and GAP43, which may account for the marked axonal growth across the lesion epicenter. Similar studies performed on P2X7 or P2Y2 receptor knock-out mice indicate P2Y2 receptors are involved in the activation of STAT3 after ATP injection or conditioning lesion, whereas P2X7 receptors are not. Injection of ATP at 150 Œºm caused little Wallerian degeneration and behavioral tests showed no significant long-term adverse effects on sciatic nerve functions. The results in this study reveal possible mechanisms underlying the stimulation of regenerative programs and suggest a practical strategy for stimulating axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Injury of peripheral axons of sensory neurons has been known to strongly enhance the regeneration of their central axons in the spinal cord. In this study, we found that injection of ATP into a peripheral nerve can mimic the effect of peripheral nerve injury and significantly increase the number of sensory axons growing across lesion epicenter in the spinal cord. ATP injection increased expression of several markers for regenerative activity in sensory neurons, including phospho-STAT3 and GAP43. ATP injection did not cause significant long-term adverse effects on the functions of the injected nerve. These results may lead to clinically applicable strategies for enhancing neuronal responses that support regeneration of injured axons.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/6/1335?rss=1">The Stress-Induced Transcription Factor NR4A1 Adjusts Mitochondrial Function and Synapse Number in Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

<p>The energetic costs of behavioral chronic stress are unlikely to be sustainable without neuronal plasticity. Mitochondria have the capacity to handle synaptic activity up to a limit before energetic depletion occurs. Protective mechanisms driven by the induction of neuronal genes likely evolved to buffer the consequences of chronic stress on excitatory neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC), as this circuitry is vulnerable to excitotoxic insults. Little is known about the genes involved in mitochondrial adaptation to the buildup of chronic stress. Using combinations of genetic manipulations and stress for analyzing structural, transcriptional, mitochondrial, and behavioral outcomes, we characterized NR4A1 as a stress-inducible modifier of mitochondrial energetic competence and dendritic spine number in PFC. NR4A1 acted as a transcription factor for changing the expression of target genes previously involved in mitochondrial uncoupling, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and synaptic growth. Maintenance of NR4A1 activity by chronic stress played a critical role in the regressive synaptic organization in PFC of mouse models of stress (male only). Knockdown, dominant-negative approach, and knockout of <i>Nr4a1</i> in mice and rats (male only) protected pyramidal neurons against the adverse effects of chronic stress. In human PFC tissues of men and women, high levels of the transcriptionally active NR4A1 correlated with measures of synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. In the context of chronic stress, prolonged expression and activity of NR4A1 may lead to responses of mitochondria and synaptic connectivity that do not match environmental demand, resulting in circuit malfunction between PFC and other brain regions, constituting a pathological feature across disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bioenergetic cost of chronic stress is too high to be sustainable by pyramidal prefrontal neurons. Cellular checkpoints have evolved to adjust the responses of mitochondria and synapses to the buildup of chronic stress. NR4A1 plays such a role by controlling the energetic competence of mitochondria with respect to synapse number. As an immediate-early gene, <i>Nr4a1</i> promotes neuronal plasticity, but sustained expression or activity can be detrimental. NR4A1 expression and activity is sustained by chronic stress in animal models and in human studies of neuropathologies sensitive to the buildup of chronic stress. Therefore, antagonism of NR4A1 is a promising avenue for preventing the regressive synaptic reorganization in cortical systems in the context of chronic stress.</p>

<p>The pervasive use of distributional semantic models or word embeddings in a
variety of research fields is due to their remarkable ability to represent the
meanings of words for both practical application and cognitive modeling.
However, little has been known about what kind of information is encoded in
text-based word vectors. This lack of understanding is particularly problematic
when word vectors are regarded as a model of semantic representation for
abstract concepts. This paper attempts to reveal the internal information of
distributional word vectors by the analysis using Binder et al.'s (2016)
brain-based vectors, explicitly structured conceptual representations based on
neurobiologically motivated attributes. In the analysis, the mapping from
text-based vectors to brain-based vectors is trained and prediction performance
is evaluated by comparing the estimated and original brain-based vectors. The
analysis demonstrates that social and cognitive information is better encoded
in text-based word vectors, but emotional information is not. This result is
discussed in terms of embodied theories for abstract concepts.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569">Alleviating catastrophic forgetting using context-dependent gating and synaptic stabilization. (arXiv:1802.01569v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones.
However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically
cause it to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of
"catastrophic forgetting", in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights
that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance.
Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of
ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate
catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are
believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a
context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly non-overlapping
patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to
implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain
high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks when
combined with weight stabilization. This work provides another example of how
neuroscience-inspired algorithms can benefit ANN design and capability.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ¬± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63‚Äì90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990‚àí1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ¬± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ¬± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1‚Äì10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.</span>

<p>by Peter W. Donhauser, Esther Florin, Sylvain Baillet</p>

Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TNJ39uqAYcw" width="1" />

<p>by Volker Pernice, Rava Azeredo da Silveira</p>

Neural populations respond to the repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus with correlated variability. These correlations have been studied in detail, with respect to their mechanistic origin, as well as their influence on stimulus discrimination and on the performance of population codes. A number of theoretical studies have endeavored to link network architecture to the nature of the correlations in neural activity. Here, we contribute to this effort: in models of circuits of stochastic neurons, we elucidate the implications of various network architectures‚Äîrecurrent connections, shared feed-forward projections, and shared gain fluctuations‚Äîon the stimulus dependence in correlations. Specifically, we derive mathematical relations that specify the dependence of population-averaged covariances on firing rates, for different network architectures. In turn, these relations can be used to analyze data on population activity. We examine recordings from neural populations in mouse auditory cortex. We find that a recurrent network model with random effective connections captures the observed statistics. Furthermore, using our circuit model, we investigate the relation between network parameters, correlations, and how well different stimuli can be discriminated from one another based on the population activity. As such, our approach allows us to relate properties of the neural circuit to information processing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANUis3AuuHE" width="1" />

<p>Direct electrical stimulation of the brain has emerged as a powerful treatment for multiple neurological diseases, and as a potential technique to enhance human cognition. Despite its application in a range of brain disorders, it remains unclear how stimulation of discrete brain areas affects memory performance and the underlying electrophysiological activities. Here, we investigated the effect of direct electrical stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus (HP), parahippocampal region (PH) neocortex, prefrontal cortex (PF), and lateral temporal cortex (TC). Intracranial EEG recordings with stimulation were collected from 22 patients during performance of verbal memory tasks. We found that high  (62‚Äì118 Hz) activity induced by word presentation was modulated by electrical stimulation. This modulatory effect was greatest for trials with "poor" memory encoding. The high  modulation correlated with the behavioral effect of stimulation in a given brain region: it was negative, i.e., the induced high  activity was decreased, in the regions where stimulation decreased memory performance, and positive in the lateral TC where memory enhancement was observed. Our results suggest that the effect of electrical stimulation on high  activity induced by word presentation may be a useful biomarker for mapping memory networks and guiding therapeutic brain stimulation.</p>

<p>The striatum has been shown to play a critical role in reward prediction. It is composed of two neurochemically and anatomically distinct compartments known as the striosomes and the matrix. The striosomes comprise only about 15% of the striatum by volume and are distributed mosaically therein. Accordingly, it has been difficult to identify striosomal neurons in electrophysiological recordings and it has been unclear whether striosomal neurons, which project to midbrain dopaminergic neurons, engage in reward prediction. In this study, we utilized a mouse line (Sepw1-NP67) selectively expressing Cre in striosomal neurons, combined with endoscopic <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging to selectively record activities of striosomal neurons during an odor-conditioning task. As mice learned the task, striosomal neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) showed predictive activities to odor cues that were associated with water rewards or aversive air puffs. These activities were proportional to the expected reward or air-puff intensity. Intriguingly, repeated recordings of the same striosomal neurons over a period of weeks revealed that predictive activities were learning-stage specific. That is, these activities disappeared after continuous training. Furthermore, presentations of rewards or air puffs activated some striosomal neurons. These findings suggest that the striosomes participate in reward prediction with learning stage-specific neural ensembles, and that they also send reward and aversive signals to dopaminergic neurons.</p>

Abstract
<p>Economic decision-making is disrupted in individuals with gambling disorder, an addictive behavior observed in Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) patients receiving dopaminergic therapy. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in the inhibition of impulsive behaviors; however, its role in impulse control disorders and addiction is still unclear. Here, we recorded STN local field potentials (LFPs) in PD patients with and without gambling disorder during an economic decision-making task. Reaction times analysis showed that for all patients, the decision whether to risk preceded task onset. We compared then for both groups the STN LFP preceding high- and low-risk economic decisions. We found that risk avoidance in gamblers correlated with larger STN LFP low-frequency (&lt;12-Hz) fluctuations preceding task onset. In particular, the amplitude of low-frequency LFP fluctuations carried significant information about future decisions. Decisions of patients not affected by gambling disorder were instead not correlated with pretask STN LFP. Our results suggest that STN activity preceding task onset affects risk decisions by preemptively inhibiting attraction to high but unlikely rewards in favor of a long-term payoff.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0350-17.2018?rss=1">An Essential Postdevelopmental Role for Lis1 in Mice</a></h4>

<p><i>LIS1</i> mutations cause lissencephaly (LIS), a severe developmental brain malformation. Much less is known about its role in the mature nervous system. LIS1 regulates the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein), and as LIS1 and dynein are both expressed in the adult nervous system, Lis1 could potentially regulate dynein-dependent processes such as axonal transport. We therefore knocked out Lis1 in adult mice using tamoxifen-induced, Cre-ER-mediated recombination. When an actin promoter was used to drive Cre-ER expression (Act-Cre-ER), heterozygous Lis1 knockout (KO) caused no obvious change in viability or behavior, despite evidence of widespread recombination by a Cre reporter three weeks after tamoxifen exposure. In contrast, homozygous Lis1 KO caused the rapid onset of neurological symptoms in both male and female mice. One tamoxifen-dosing regimen caused prominent recombination in the midbrain/hindbrain, PNS, and cardiac/skeletal muscle within a week; these mice developed severe symptoms in that time frame and were killed. A different tamoxifen regimen resulted in delayed recombination in midbrain/hindbrain, but not in other tissues, and also delayed the onset of symptoms. This indicates that Lis1 loss in the midbrain/hindbrain causes the severe phenotype. In support of this, brainstem regions known to house cardiorespiratory centers showed signs of axonal dysfunction in KO animals. Transport defects, neurofilament (NF) alterations, and varicosities were observed in axons in cultured DRG neurons from KO animals. Because no symptoms were observed when a cardiac specific Cre-ER promoter was used, we propose a vital role for Lis1 in autonomic neurons and implicate defective axonal transport in the KO phenotype.</p>

<p><i>Solenopsis invicta</i>, the red imported fire ant, represents one of the most devastating invasive species. To understand their sensory physiology, we identified and characterized their Hymenoptera-specific (Hs) TRPA channel, SiHsTRPA. Consistent with the sensory functions of SiHsTRPA, it is activated by heat, an electrophile, and an insect repellent. Nevertheless, SiHsTRPA does not respond to most of the honey bee ortholog (AmHsTRPA)-activating compounds. The jewel wasp ortholog (NvHsTRPA) is activated by these compounds even though it outgroups both AmHsTRPA and SiHsTRPA. Characterization of AmHsTRPA/SiHsTRPA chimeric channels revealed that the amino acids in the N terminus, as well as ankyrin repeat 2 (AR2) of AmHsTRPA, are essential for the response to camphor. Furthermore, amino acids in ARs 3 and 5‚Äì7 were specifically required for the response to diallyl disulfide. Thus, amino acid substitutions in the corresponding domains of SiHsTRPA during evolution would be responsible for the loss of chemical sensitivity. SiHsTRPA-activating compounds repel red imported fire ants, suggesting that SiHsTRPA functions as a sensor for noxious compounds. SiHsTRPA represents an example of the species-specific modulation of orthologous TRPA channel properties by amino acid substitutions in multiple domains, and SiHsTRPA-activating compounds could be used to develop a method for controlling red imported fire ants.</p>

Abstract
<p>The prefrontal cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation that plays an important role in its regulation. However, how serotonin regulates different pyramidal and interneuron cell classes in this area is incompletely understood. Previous work in rats has shown that serotonin differentially regulates two classes of pyramidal cells in layer 5. It excites one class by activating 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, whereas it more subtly modulates the integrative properties of the other by co-activating 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Here we have used electrophysiological recordings, combined with retrograde labeling and morphological reconstruction, to show that the first cell class corresponds to long range corticofugal neurons and the second corresponds to intratelencephalic neurons. These results suggest that, in rats, serotonin facilitates subcortical output while more subtly modulating cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal output. Interestingly, these results obtained in rats differ from those previously reported for mouse prefrontal cortex. Therefore we reinvestigated the effects of serotonin in mice and confirmed that serotonin predominantly activates inhibitory 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors on long-range corticofugal cells. Thus serotonin exerts opposite effects on these cells in rats and mice. Finally, we determined whether cortical serotonin responsiveness in mice is regulated during development. Serotonin elicited predominantly depolarizing inward current responses during the early postnatal period, whereas inhibitory 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated responses did not become evident until the end of the second postnatal week. These results reveal commonalities as well as unexpected differences in the serotonergic regulation of long-range corticofugal and intratelencephalic neurons of layer 5 in rat and mouse.</p>

Abstract
<p>Efficient clearance of dopamine (DA) from the synapse is key to regulating dopaminergic signaling. This role is fulfilled by DA transporters (DATs). Recent advances in the structural characterization of DAT from <i>Drosophila</i> (dDAT) and in high-resolution imaging of DA neurons and the distribution of DATs in living cells now permit us to gain a mechanistic understanding of DA reuptake events <i>in silico</i>. Using electron microscopy images and immunofluorescence of transgenic knock-in mouse brains that express hemagglutinin-tagged DAT in DA neurons, we reconstructed a realistic environment for MCell simulations of DA reuptake, wherein the identity, population and kinetics of homology-modeled human DAT (hDAT) substates were derived from molecular simulations. The complex morphology of axon terminals near active zones was observed to give rise to large variations in DA reuptake efficiency, and thereby in extracellular DA density. Comparison of the effect of different firing patterns showed that phasic firing would increase the probability of reaching local DA levels sufficiently high to activate low-affinity DA receptors, mainly owing to high DA levels transiently attained during the burst phase. The experimentally observed nonuniform surface distribution of DATs emerged as a major modulator of DA signaling: reuptake was slower, and the peaks/width of transient DA levels were sharper/wider under nonuniform distribution of DATs, compared with uniform. Overall, the study highlights the importance of accurate descriptions of extrasynaptic morphology, DAT distribution, and conformational kinetics for quantitative evaluation of dopaminergic transmission and for providing deeper understanding of the mechanisms that regulate DA transmission.</p>

<p>Catecholaminergic (dopamine and norepinephrine) projections to the cortex play an important role in cognitive functions and dysfunctions including learning, addiction, and mental disorders. While dynamics of glutamatergic synapses have been well studied in such contexts, little is known regarding catecholaminergic projections, owing to lack of robust methods. Here we report a system to monitor catecholaminergic projections <i>in vivo</i> over the timeframes that such events occur. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression driven by tyrosine hydroxylase promoter in a transgenic mouse line enabled us to perform two-photon imaging of cortical catecholaminergic projections through a cranial window. Repetitive imaging of the same axons over 24 h revealed the highly dynamic nature of catecholaminergic boutons. Surprisingly, administration of single high dose methamphetamine (MAP) induced a transient increase in bouton volumes. This new method opens avenues for longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> evaluation of structural changes at single release sites of catecholamines in association with physiology and pathology of cortical functions.</p>

Abstract
<p>Molecular identification and characterization of fear controlling circuitries is a promising path towards developing targeted treatments of fear-related disorders. Three-color <i>in situ</i> hybridization analysis was used to determine whether somatostatin (SOM, <i>Sst</i>), neurotensin (NTS, <i>Nts</i>), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, <i>Crf</i>), tachykinin 2 (TAC2, <i>Tac2</i>), protein kinase c- (PKC-, <i>Prkcd</i>), and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2, <i>Drd2</i>) mRNA colocalize in male mouse amygdala neurons. Expression and colocalization was examined across capsular (CeC), lateral (CeL), and medial (CeM) compartments of the central amygdala. The greatest expression of <i>Prkcd</i> and <i>Drd2</i> were found in CeC and CeL. <i>Crf</i> was expressed primarily in CeL, while <i>Sst</i>-, <i>Nts</i>-, and <i>Tac2</i>-expressing neurons were distributed between CeL and CeM. High levels of colocalization were identified between <i>Sst</i>, <i>Nts</i>, <i>Crf</i>, and <i>Tac2</i> within the CeL, while little colocalization was detected between any mRNAs within the CeM. These findings provide a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and maintenance of fear and anxiety behaviors.  </p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Astrocytes fulfill neuronal trophic roles normally, but are transformed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) into A1-type reactive astrocytes that may destroy neurons through unknown mechanisms. <b>Methods</b>: To investigate astrocyte inflammatory mechanisms, astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated immunochemically from plasmas of AD patients and matched controls for ELISA quantification of complement proteins. <b>Results</b>: ADE levels of C1q, C4b, C3d, factor B, factor D, Bb, C3b and C5b-C9 terminal complement complex (TCC), but not mannose-binding lectin (MBL), normalized by the CD81 exosome marker were significantly higher for AD patients (n=28) than age- and gender-matched controls (all p&lt;0.0001). ADE normalized levels of IL-6, TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤ were significantly higher for AD patients than controls, but there was greater overlap between the two groups than for complement proteins. Mean ADE levels of complement proteins for AD patients in a longitudinal study were significantly higher (n=16, p&lt;0.0001) at the AD2 stage of moderate dementia than at the AD1 preclinical stage five to 12 years earlier, which were the same as for controls. ADE levels of complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD46, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and complement receptor type 1 (CR1), but not factor I, were significantly lower for AD patients than controls (p&lt;0.0001 for CD59 and DAF), were diminished by the AD1 stage and were further decreased at the AD2 stage. <b>Interpretation</b>: ADE complement effector proteins in AD are produced by dysregulated systems, attain higher levels than in controls, and may potentially damage neurons in the late inflammatory phase of AD.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Introduction</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis is mediated by IgG-autoantibodies directed against the NR1-subunit of the NMDAR. Around 20% of patients have an underlying ovarian teratoma, and the condition responds to early immunotherapies and ovarian teratoma removal. However, despite clear therapeutic relevance, mechanisms of NR1-IgG production and the contribution of germinal center B cells to NR1-IgG levels are unknown.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Clinical data and longitudinal paired serum NR1-reactive IgM and IgG levels from ten patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis were determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these ten patients, and two available ovarian teratomas, were stimulated with combinations of immune factors, and tested for secretion of total IgG and NR1-antibodies.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In addition to disease-defining NR1-IgG, serum NR1-IgM were found in 6/10 patients. NR1-IgM levels were typically highest around disease onset, and detected for several months into the disease course. Moreover, circulating patient B cells were differentiated into CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>++</sup>CD38<sup>++</sup> antibody-secreting cells <em>in vitro</em> and, in 90% of patients, secreted NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG. Secreted levels of NR1-IgG correlated with serum NR1-IgG (p&lt;0.0001) and this was observed across the varying disease durations, suggestive of an ongoing process. Furthermore, ovarian teratoma tissue contained infiltrating lymphocytes which produced NR1-IgG in culture.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Persistent serum NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG, alongside the consistent production of NR1-IgG from circulating B cells and from ovarian teratomas suggest ongoing germinal center-reactions may account for the peripheral cell populations which secrete NR1-IgG. Cells participating in germinal center reactions might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital nondystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> are a frequent cause of NM (ie, NEM3). <em>ACTA1</em> encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of 14 NEM3 patients with different <em>ACTA1</em> mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force-generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients. This information is crucial for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

                <h4><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25151">Randomized trial of transcranial direct current stimulation for poststroke dysphagia</a></h4>

<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to enhance dysphagia rehabilitation following stroke. Besides relating clinical effects with neuroplastic changes in cortical swallowing processing, we aimed to identify factors influencing treatment success.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In this double-blind, randomized study, 60 acute dysphagic stroke patients received contralesional anodal (1mA, 20 minutes) or sham tDCS on 4 consecutive days. Swallowing function was thoroughly assessed before and after the intervention using the validated Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) and clinical assessment. In 10 patients, swallowing-related brain activation was recorded applying magnetoencephalography before and after the intervention. Voxel-based statistical lesion pattern analysis was also performed.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Study groups did not differ according to demographic data, stroke characteristics, or baseline dysphagia severity. Patients treated with tDCS showed greater improvement in FEDSS than the sham group (1.3 vs 0.4 points, mean difference‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.4‚Äì1.4, <em>p</em>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0005). Functional recovery was accompanied by a significant increase of activation (<em>p</em>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05) in the contralesional swallowing network after real but not sham tDCS. Regarding predictors of treatment success, for every hour earlier that treatment was initiated, there was greater improvement on the FEDSS (adjusted odds ratio‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.99, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.98‚Äì1.00, <em>p</em>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05) in multivariate analysis. Stroke location in the right insula and operculum was indicative of worse response to tDCS (<em>p</em>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Application of tDCS over the contralesional swallowing motor cortex supports swallowing network reorganization, thereby leading to faster rehabilitation of acute poststroke dysphagia. Early treatment initiation seems beneficial. tDCS may be less effective in right-hemispheric insulo-opercular stroke. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in human
beings, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current
standard of care includes interventional catheter ablation in selected
patients, but the success rate is limited. The major limitation of the current
approach to AF is the lack of fundamental understanding of its underlying
mechanism. Specifically, it remains unclear whether human AF dynamics are a
deterministic or a stochastic process. Here we assess for determinism in human
AF by evaluating the properties of the symbolic representation of intracardiac
electrical recordings obtained from patients. Specifically, we evaluate (a) the
number of the missing ordinal patterns, (b) the rate of missing ordinal pattern
decay for increased length of the time series, and (c) the causal-entropy
complexity plane of the Bandt-Pompe symbolic representation. When used
together, these are powerful tools to detect determinism, even in the presence
of experimental noise and brief time series.

<p>`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.

<p>Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

<p>Certain concepts, words, and images are intuitively more similar than others
(dog vs. cat, dog vs. spoon), though quantifying such similarity is notoriously
difficult. Indeed, this kind of computation is likely a critical part of
learning the category boundaries for words within a given language. Here, we
use a set of 27 items (e.g. 'dog') that are highly common in infants' input,
and use both image- and word-based algorithms to independently compute
similarity among them. We find three key results. First, the pairwise item
similarities derived within image-space and word-space are correlated,
suggesting preserved structure among these extremely different representational
formats. Second, the closest 'neighbors' for each item, within each space,
showed significant overlap (e.g. both found 'egg' as a neighbor of 'apple').
Third, items with the most overlapping neighbors are later-learned by infants
and toddlers. We conclude that this approach, which does not rely on human
ratings of similarity, may nevertheless reflect stable within-class structure
across these two spaces. We speculate that such invariance might aid lexical
acquisition, by serving as an informative marker of category boundaries.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8‚Äì11 years), adolescents (12‚Äì15 years), and adults (18‚Äì23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one‚Äôs own body in typically developing humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callithrix jacchus</span>), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ¬± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior‚Äìposterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Radial migration of cortical projection neurons is a prerequisite for shaping a distinct multilayered cerebral cortex during mammalian corticogenesis. Members of Rab GTPases family were reported to regulate radial migration. Here, in vivo conditional knockout or in utero knockdown (KD) of Rab23 in mice neocortex causes aberrant polarity and halted migration of cortical projection neurons. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism reveals down-regulation of N-cadherin in the Rab23-deficient neurons, which is a cell adhesion protein previously known to modulate radial migration. (Shikanai M, Nakajima K, Kawauchi T. 2011. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons. Commun Integr Biol. 4:326‚Äì330.) Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) also decreases the expression of N-cadherin, implicating an upstream effect of ERK1/2 on N-cadherin and also suggesting a link between Rab23 and ERK1/2. Further biochemical studies show that silencing of Rab23 impedes activation of ERK1/2 via perturbed platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRŒ±) signaling. Restoration of the expression of Rab23 or N-cadherin in Rab23-KD neurons could reverse neuron migration defects, indicating that Rab23 modulates migration through N-cadherin. These studies suggest that cortical neuron migration is mediated by a molecular hierarchy downstream of Rab23 via N-cadherin.</span>

Mycolactone is the exotoxin produced by <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> and is the virulence factor behind the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin has a broad spectrum of biological effects within the host organism, stemming from its interaction with at least two molecular targets and the inhibition of protein uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it has been shown that the toxin can passively permeate into host cells, it is clearly lipophilic. Association with lipid carriers would have substantial implications for the toxin‚Äôs distribution within a host organism, delivery to cellular targets, diagnostic susceptibility, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Yet the toxin‚Äôs interactions with, and distribution in, lipids are unknown. Herein we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, guided by all-atom simulations, to study the interaction of mycolactone with pure and mixed lipid membranes. Using established techniques, we calculated the toxin‚Äôs preferential localization, membrane translocation, and impact on membrane physical and dynamical properties. The computed water-octanol partition coefficient indicates that mycolactone prefers to be in an organic phase rather than in an aqueous environment. Our results show that in a solvated membrane environment the exotoxin mainly localizes in the water-membrane interface, with a preference for the glycerol moiety of lipids, consistent with the reported studies that found it in lipid extracts of the cell. The calculated association constant to the model membrane is similar to the reported association constant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Mycolactone is shown to modify the physical properties of membranes, lowering the transition temperature, compressibility modulus, and critical line tension at which pores can be stabilized. It also shows a tendency to behave as a linactant, a molecule that localizes at the boundary between different fluid lipid domains in membranes and promotes inter-mixing of domains. This property has implications for the toxin‚Äôs cellular access, T-cell immunosuppression, and therapeutic potential.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LYJj4QzsN_A" width="1" />

<p>by Caitlin Collins, Xavier Didelot</p>

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, microbial GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OLN5pMOESlw" width="1" />

<p>by Pau Farr√©, Eldon Emberly</p>

The packaging of DNA inside a nucleus shows complex structure stabilized by a host of DNA-bound factors. Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors‚Äîthe chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O5rA1JNPMq0" width="1" />

<p>by Ximing Li, William R. Holmes</p>

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca<sup>2+</sup> input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. Depending on whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yb7HPOwKnGo" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Neuropathic pain is caused by peripheral nerve injury (PNI). One hallmark symptom is allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuous stimuli), but its mechanistic underpinning remains elusive. Notably, whether selective stimulation of non-nociceptive primary afferent AŒ≤ fibers indeed evokes neuropathic pain-like sensory and emotional behaviors after PNI is unknown, because of the lack of tools to manipulate AŒ≤ fiber function in awake, freely moving animals. In this study, we used a transgenic rat line that enables stimulation of non-nociceptive AŒ≤ fibers by a light-activated channel (channelrhodopsin-2). We found that illuminating light to the plantar skin of these rats with PNI elicited pain-like withdrawal behaviors that were resistant to morphine. Light illumination to the skin of PNI rats increased the number of spinal dorsal horn lamina I neurons positive to activity markers (c-Fos and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase). Whole-cell recording revealed that optogenetic AŒ≤ fiber stimulation after PNI caused excitation of lamina I neurons, which were normally silent by this stimulation. Moreover, illuminating the hindpaw of PNI rats resulted in activation of central amygdaloid neurons and produced an aversion to illumination. Thus, these findings provide the first evidence that optogenetic activation of primary afferent AŒ≤ fibers in PNI rats produces excitation of lamina I neurons and neuropathic pain-like behaviors that were resistant to morphine treatment. This approach may provide a new path for investigating circuits and behaviors of AŒ≤ fiber-mediated neuropathic allodynia with sensory and emotional aspects after PNI and for discovering novel drugs to treat neuropathic pain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic pain condition occurring after nerve damage. A cardinal, intractable symptom is allodynia, pain caused by innocuous stimuli. However, its mechanistic underpinning remains elusive, and, notably, whether non-nociceptive primary afferent AŒ≤ fibers after nerve injury indeed evokes neuropathic pain-like sensory and emotional behaviors is unknown. Using optogenetics, we show for the first time that optical activation of non-nociceptive AŒ≤ fibers of nerve-injured rats is sufficient to produce morphine-resistant pain-like withdrawal behaviors, excitation of spinal lamina I neurons, and emotional aversion. This study provides a novel approach to facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying AŒ≤ fiber-mediated neuropathic allodynia with sensory and emotional aspects and to discover new drugs for treating neuropathic pain.</p>

<p>Byrne and colleagues present a paper on a timely topic with potentially
important results. However, we think that issues in the design and analysis
complicate the interpretation and limit the generalizability of the findings.
Specifically, the details of the small volume correction used in the primary
analysis are not adequately described and, moreover, the results do not appear
to be corroborated by the whole-brain analysis. In addition, the follow-up
multilevel modeling, which is fundamental to the conclusions of the paper, is
inherently circular thereby guaranteeing discovery of the reported effect.
Finally, the study does not control for other factors that vary over the course
of the day and are known to impact MRI measurements, and fails to link the
neural results directly to any relevant behavior.

The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (D<sub>2</sub>Rs) contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine signaling and prefrontal function. Genetic networks from post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span>. Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D<sub>2</sub>Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses. Therefore, brain response to a dopaminergic drug may depend on a complex system of allelic patterns associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How the variety of neurons that organize into neocortical layers and functional areas arises is a central question in the study of cortical development. While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2‚Äì3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14‚Äì17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20‚Äì24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial. These data provide the first evidence that activity of single neurons in ACC is elevated when 2 responses are in competition with each other when there is a need to change the course of action to obtain reward.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive Œ≤1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.</span>

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models‚ÄîCallus Analogs‚Äîwere created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80√ó80 Œºm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog‚Äîa theory‚Äîof the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ‚â• 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73‚Äì90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2‚Äì4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83‚Äì94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk" width="1" />

<p>by Bandan Chakrabortty, Ikram Blilou, Ben Scheres, Bela M. Mulder</p>

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and <i>Hedera helix</i>. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg" width="1" />

<p>by Fei Qi, Magdalena Motz, Kirsten Jung, J√ºrgen Lassak, Dmitrij Frishman</p>

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M" width="1" />

Bioinformatics is recognized as part of the essential knowledge base of numerous career paths in biomedical research and healthcare. However, there is little agreement in the field over what that knowledge entails or how best to provide it. These disagreements are compounded by the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training, with divergent prior backgrounds and intended application areas. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H-O9q3LkWbg" width="1" />

Two recent papers have tackled the fundamental questions of how place fields are formed in a new environment and what plasticity mechanisms contribute to this process. Bittner et al., in their recent publication, discovered a novel plasticity rule that, in contrast to previous rules, spans the behavioral, seconds-long, timescale. Sheffield et al. have monitored, for the first time, dendritic activity during place field formation, and show the emergence of spatially tuned local NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.

Modern neuroscientific techniques that specifically manipulate and measure neuronal activity in behaving animals now allow bridging of the gap from the cellular to the behavioral level. However, in doing so, they also pose new challenges. Research using incompletely defined manipulations in a high-dimensional space without clear hypotheses is likely to suffer from multiple well-known conceptual and statistical problems. In this context it is essential to develop hypotheses with testable implications across levels.

The hippocampus is one of the brain‚Äôs great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.

2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978‚Äì2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.

Prior to the 21st century, genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep were largely unknown. In 1998, de Lecea et al. [1] (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95:322‚Äì327) and Sakurai et al. [2] (Cell 1998; 92: 573‚Äì585) reported the discovery of a gene they named hypocretin and orexin, respectively, which led to a revolution in our understanding of genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Initially, MeCP2 had been shown to be a repressor of gene transcription. In their 2008 paper, Chahrour and colleagues (DOI: 10.1126/science.1153252) reported that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator.

The structural identification of the cationic channel of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor involved its biochemical tagging by channel blockers, followed by site-directed mutagenesis analyses reported in two papers in 1988. The ion channel was demonstrated to be lined by the transmembrane segment MII, in which the binding sites of channel blockers are ‚Äúframed‚Äù by anionic rings.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TpqgoEqOUBM/article">GSimp: A Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach for metabolomics studies</a></h4>

<p>by Runmin Wei, Jingye Wang, Erik Jia, Tianlu Chen, Yan Ni, Wei Jia</p>

Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TpqgoEqOUBM" width="1" />
