              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01939">Human fields and their impact on brain waves A pilot study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During brain function, groups of neurons fire synchronously. When these groups are large enough, the resulting electrical signals can be measured on the scalp using Electroencephalography (EEG). The amplitude of these signals can be significant depending on the size and synchronization of the neural activity. EEG waves exhibit distinct patterns based on the brain's state, such as whether it is asleep, awake, engaged in mental calculations, or performing other cognitive functions. Additionally, these patterns can be modified by external factors, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS involves bringing an antenna that generates variable electromagnetic fields close to specific areas of the skull to treat certain pathologies. Given that the human body naturally generates magnetic fields, a question arises: Can these fields influence the EEG by modulating neuronal function, causing a resonance effect, or through some unknown interaction? This study investigated whether approaching the palm of the hand to the top of the head (Intervention) could induce effects in the EEG. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was obtained for the 30 seconds preceding the intervention (PSD_pre) and the final 30 seconds of the intervention (PSD_last). The exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggests that the median of PSD_pre is greater than the median of PSD_last at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.004353). In contrast, in the control group, the test indicates that at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.7667), the median of PSD_pre is not greater than the median of PSD_last.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02154">Structural constraints to compare phenomenal experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article defines a partial order structure to study the relationship between levels and contents of conscious subjective experience in a single mathematical set-up. We understand phenomenal structure as extrapolated relationships among experiences, instead of fixed properties of specific experiences. Our mathematical account is based on multilayer network theory. Multilayer theory is a generalization of graph and network theory, widely used in several scientific domains. This structure is also the underlying conceptual and mathematical structure of most current models of conscious experience. From our simple set of assumptions, yet rigorous analysis, we conclude that assuming the comparison and quantification among phenomenal experiences yield only partial comparison, rather than commonly assumed absolute comparability. This has implications for evolutionary and animal consciousness: evolution may encompass diverse modes of experiencing, not necessarily implying larger ones on an absolute scale. Our characterization elucidates structural constraints on experiential comparisons imposed by assumptions and choices made by modellers as active participants in the scientific process. In summary, in light of our phenomenological intuitions, it might be right that some experiences carry qualitative aspects that make them incompatible or non-comparable with other experiences, quantitatively speaking. Some experiences are comparable (e.g. at some experiential levels), but others are not. These results have direct implications for consciousness science, evolution and animal consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01688">BrainOOD: Out-of-distribution Generalizable Brain Network Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neuroscience, identifying distinct patterns linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Autism, is critical for early diagnosis and effective intervention. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising in analyzing brain networks, but there are two major challenges in using GNNs: (1) distribution shifts in multi-site brain network data, leading to poor Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, and (2) limited interpretability in identifying key brain regions critical to neurological disorders. Existing graph OOD methods, while effective in other domains, struggle with the unique characteristics of brain networks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce BrainOOD, a novel framework tailored for brain networks that enhances GNNs' OOD generalization and interpretability. BrainOOD framework consists of a feature selector and a structure extractor, which incorporates various auxiliary losses including an improved Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) objective to recover causal subgraphs. By aligning structure selection across brain networks and filtering noisy features, BrainOOD offers reliable interpretations of critical brain regions. Our approach outperforms 16 existing methods and improves generalization to OOD subjects by up to 8.5%. Case studies highlight the scientific validity of the patterns extracted, which aligns with the findings in known neuroscience literature. We also propose the first OOD brain network benchmark, which provides a foundation for future research in this field. Our code is available at https://github.com/AngusMonroe/BrainOOD.

                arXiv:2502.02151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multicomplex structure is defined from an ordered lattice of multigraphs. This structure will help us to observe the features of Persistent Homology in this context, its interaction with the ordering and the repercussions of the process of merging multigraphs in the calculation of the Betti numbers. For the latter, an extended version of the incremental algorithm is provided. The ideas here developed are mainly oriented to the original example described in [10] and used more extensively in [11] in the context of the formalization of the notion of embodiment in Neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02279">A Revisit of Total Correlation in Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder with Partial Disentanglement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully disentangled variational auto-encoder (VAE) aims to identify disentangled latent components from observations. However, enforcing full independence between all latent components may be too strict for certain datasets. In some cases, multiple factors may be entangled together in a non-separable manner, or a single independent semantic meaning could be represented by multiple latent components within a higher-dimensional manifold. To address such scenarios with greater flexibility, we develop the Partially Disentangled VAE (PDisVAE), which generalizes the total correlation (TC) term in fully disentangled VAEs to a partial correlation (PC) term. This framework can handle group-wise independence and can naturally reduce to either the standard VAE or the fully disentangled VAE. Validation through three synthetic experiments demonstrates the correctness and practicality of PDisVAE. When applied to real-world datasets, PDisVAE discovers valuable information that is difficult to find using fully disentangled VAEs, implying its versatility and effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01837">TESS: A Scalable Temporally and Spatially Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for low-power inference and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has intensified the need for algorithms that are both scalable and energy-efficient. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02190">Discovering Quality-Diversity Algorithms via Meta-Black-Box Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity has emerged as a powerful family of evolutionary algorithms that generate diverse populations of high-performing solutions by implementing local competition principles inspired by biological evolution. While these algorithms successfully foster diversity and innovation, their specific mechanisms rely on heuristics, such as grid-based competition in MAP-Elites or nearest-neighbor competition in unstructured archives. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different approach: using meta-learning to automatically discover novel Quality-Diversity algorithms. By parameterizing the competition rules using attention-based neural architectures, we evolve new algorithms that capture complex relationships between individuals in the descriptor space. Our discovered algorithms demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to established Quality-Diversity baselines while exhibiting strong generalization to higher dimensions, larger populations, and out-of-distribution domains like robot control. Notably, even when optimized solely for fitness, these algorithms naturally maintain diverse populations, suggesting meta-learning rediscovers that diversity is fundamental to effective optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01654">Predicting concentration levels of air pollutants by transfer learning and recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution (AP) poses a great threat to human health, and people are paying more attention than ever to its prediction. Accurate prediction of AP helps people to plan for their outdoor activities and aids protecting human health. In this paper, long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used to predict the future concentration of air pollutants (APS) in Macau. Additionally, meteorological data and data on the concentration of APS have been utilized. Moreover, in Macau, some air quality monitoring stations (AQMSs) have less observed data in quantity, and, at the same time, some AQMSs recorded less observed data of certain types of APS. Therefore, the transfer learning and pre-trained neural networks have been employed to assist AQMSs with less observed data to build a neural network with high prediction accuracy. The experimental sample covers a period longer than 12-year and includes daily measurements from several APS as well as other more classical meteorological values. Records from five stations, four out of them are AQMSs and the remaining one is an automatic weather station, have been prepared from the aforesaid period and eventually underwent to computational intelligence techniques to build and extract a prediction knowledge-based system. As shown by experimentation, LSTM RNNs initialized with transfer learning methods have higher prediction accuracy; it incurred shorter training time than randomly initialized recurrent neural networks.

                arXiv:2502.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble technique and under-sampling technique are both effective tools used for imbalanced dataset classification problems. In this paper, a novel ensemble method combining the advantages of both ensemble learning for biasing classifiers and a new under-sampling method is proposed. The under-sampling method is named Binary PSO instance selection; it gathers with ensemble classifiers to find the most suitable length and combination of the majority class samples to build a new dataset with minority class samples. The proposed method adopts multi-objective strategy, and contribution of this method is a notable improvement of the performances of imbalanced classification, and in the meantime guaranteeing a best integrity possible for the original dataset. We experimented the proposed method and compared its performance of processing imbalanced datasets with several other conventional basic ensemble methods. Experiment is also conducted on these imbalanced datasets using an improved version where ensemble classifiers are wrapped in the Binary PSO instance selection. According to experimental results, our proposed methods outperform single ensemble methods, state-of-the-art under-sampling methods, and also combinations of these methods with the traditional PSO instance selection algorithm.

Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.

Abstract: This work presents a technique to build interaction-based Cognitive Twins (a computational version of an external agent) using input-output training and an Evolution Strategy on top of a framework for distributed Cognitive Architectures. Here, we show that it's possible to orchestrate many simple physical and virtual devices to achieve good approximations of a person's interaction behavior by training the system in an end-to-end fashion and present performance metrics. The generated Cognitive Twin may later be used to automate tasks, generate more realistic human-like artificial agents or further investigate its behaviors.

                arXiv:2502.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have shown potential for solving combinatorial and continuous optimization problems due to their ability to capture variable-constraint interactions. While existing approaches leverage MPNNs to approximate solutions or warm-start traditional solvers, they often lack guarantees for feasibility, particularly in convex optimization settings. Here, we propose an iterative MPNN framework to solve convex optimization problems with provable feasibility guarantees. First, we demonstrate that MPNNs can provably simulate standard interior-point methods for solving quadratic problems with linear constraints, covering relevant problems such as SVMs. Secondly, to ensure feasibility, we introduce a variant that starts from a feasible point and iteratively restricts the search within the feasible region. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing neural baselines in solution quality and feasibility, generalizes well to unseen problem sizes, and, in some cases, achieves faster solution times than state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi.

                arXiv:2406.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene expression programming is an evolutionary optimization algorithm with the potential to generate interpretable and easily implementable equations for regression problems. Despite knowledge gained from previous optimizations being potentially available, the initial candidate solutions are typically generated randomly at the beginning and often only include features or terms based on preliminary user assumptions. This random initial guess, which lacks constraints on the search space, typically results in higher computational costs in the search for an optimal solution. Meanwhile, transfer learning, a technique to reuse parts of trained models, has been successfully applied to neural networks. However, no generalized strategy for its use exists for symbolic regression in the context of evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose an approach for integrating transfer learning with gene expression programming applied to symbolic regression. The constructed framework integrates Natural Language Processing techniques to discern correlations and recurring patterns from equations explored during previous optimizations. This integration facilitates the transfer of acquired knowledge from similar tasks to new ones. Through empirical evaluation of the extended framework across a range of univariate problems from an open database and from the field of computational fluid dynamics, our results affirm that initial solutions derived via a transfer learning mechanism enhance the algorithm's convergence rate towards improved solutions.

                arXiv:2310.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool for extracting valuable information and making various predictions from diverse datasets. Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of MICS-EFS to improve model accuracy and efficiency in various machine learning tasks. Furthermore, the proposed method has been validated in a real-world industrial application focused on machining processes, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality in addressing complex input-output challenges.

                arXiv:2405.09351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points, which can be characterized via Morse functions. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate, if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and the infinite depth case. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding, i.e., on the exact representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs. Our dynamical systems viewpoint on the geometric structure of the input-output map provides a fundamental understanding of why certain architectures perform better than others.

                arXiv:2409.19140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are recurrent neural networks usually employed for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems with relatively ease of training. By incorporating physical laws into the training of ESNs, Physics-Informed ESNs (PI-ESNs) were proposed initially to model chaotic dynamic systems without external inputs. They require less data for training since Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) of the considered system help to regularize the ESN. In this work, the PI-ESN is extended with external inputs to model controllable nonlinear dynamic systems. Additionally, an existing self-adaptive balancing loss method is employed to balance the contributions of the residual regression term and the physics-informed loss term in the total loss function. The experiments with two nonlinear systems modeled by ODEs, the Van der Pol oscillator and the four-tank system, and with one differential-algebraic (DAE) system, an electric submersible pump, revealed that the proposed PI-ESN outperforms the conventional ESN, especially in scenarios with limited data availability, showing that PI-ESNs can regularize an ESN model with external inputs previously trained on just a few datapoints, reducing its overfitting and improving its generalization error (up to 92% relative reduction in the test error). Further experiments demonstrated that the proposed PI-ESN is robust to parametric uncertainties in the ODE equations and that model predictive control using PI-ESN outperforms the one using plain ESN, particularly when training data is scarce.

                arXiv:2502.00029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial metrics like the Sharpe ratio are pivotal in evaluating investment performance by balancing risk and return. However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics to discover enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) a novel use of LLMs to generate and refine financial metrics with implicit domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure that evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-returns, and 2x portfolio performance. Experimental results in a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of discovered metrics, making them highly relevant to portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.

                Background Hitherto, BDNF levels in humans have been primarily measured in serum and/or plasma where these levels are readily measurable, but primarily reflect the content of BDNF in blood platelets. By contrast, previous attempts to measure BDNF levels in readily accessible human body fluids such as saliva have been complicated by a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity of BDNF ELISAs (see Discussion). Recently, the suitability of a highly sensitive BDNF ELISA assay was validated using mouse plasma and serum where conventional BDNF ELISA fail to detect BDNF. In this report, we demonstrate that BDNF levels in human saliva are extremely low, in the low pg/mL range, yet detectable in all saliva samples tested. Methods Saliva samples were collected from healthy volunteers by a passive drool method. All samples were aliquoted and immediately frozen to keep at -80°C until use. At the time of use, the samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove any remaining particles and BDNF measurement conducted by using a previously validated BDNF ELISA assay (see below). Recombinant mature BDNF was used as a reference. Results The intra-assay variability was in the range of CV = 1.8 to 4.9%. Saliva samples could be kept frozen at -80°C for 2 months until use for measurements, but more than 4 freeze and thaw cycles caused BDNF losses presumably due to structural change of the antigen. The measurements were not affected by the method of collection provided the samples were diluted at least 2-fold. Conclusions The results indicate that human saliva samples collected in a non-invasive fashion can be used as a source of material to try and correlate BDNF levels with human conditions of interest. These results also confirm those of an independent study published recently using the same BDNF ELISA kit to measure BDNF levels in human saliva samples.

                Background Nefopam hydrochloride (NPH) is a non-narcotic analgesic that is severely affected by its extensive hepatic metabolism resulting in low oral bioavailability. This study aimed to develop NPH thermosensitive in situ gel to enhance its bioavailability by avoidance of first pass effect through rectal administration. Methods A cold method was employed to develop NPH thermosensitive rectal in situ gel utilizing various concentrations of poloxamer 407 (P 407) and poloxamer 188 (P188) alone or in mixture as thermosensitive polymers and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K4M (HPMCK4M) as well as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as mucoadhesive polymers. The achieved formulas were assessed for various in vitro constraints including: solution-gel temperature, gelation time, appearance, pH, gel strength, viscosity, in vitro drug release study. Furthermore, the optimized formula was evaluated for in vivo localization and permeability. Results The obtained outcomes demonstrated a direct correlation between solution-gelation temperatures and poloxamer 188 concentration as well as an inverse correlation with the concentration of both P407 and HPMCK4M. A direct correlation was perceived between the mucoadhesive forces and viscosity with HPMCK4M concentration. Additionally, an inverse correlation was observed between NPH released with HPMCK4M concentration. The optimal NPH gel formula (F8) (18% P407/2% P188 and 0.6%) presented a compatible pH value (7.2±0.35), an acceptable sol-gel T (35.4 °C), gel strength (39.54 ± 0.803), a mucoadhesion force of 6340.6 dyne/cm2 and sustained drug release of 85% at 8 hrs. Additionally it showed sufficient localization and a permeation flux of 0.0398 mg/cm2/h, and apparent permeability (Papp) of 1.99*10−3. Conclusions It was concluded that this drug delivery system may serve as a promising alternative to other dosage forms containing NPH, owing to avoidance of first-pass metabolism, enhanced bioavailability, non-invasiveness, and reduced adverse effects associated with other forms.

                This paper introduces fuzzy subalgebras of autometrized algebras and studies their properties. Also, we present fuzzy ideals of autometrized algebras and provide examples to illustrate our findings. We examine the homomorphisms of both the images and the inverse images of fuzzy subalgebras and ideals. Furthermore, we introduce fuzzy congruences on autometrized algebras. We prove that in normal autometrized algebra, the set of all fuzzy ideals is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all fuzzy congruences.

                Background Miniplates are frequently used in oral and maxillofacial surgery to address malocclusion issues. However, surface damage to miniplates is a significant concern that can affect surgical outcomes and patient quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the influence of miniplate surface damage on bacterial attachment, which may lead to postoperative infections. Methods Miniplates with varying degrees of surface damage were used in this study. The damaged surfaces were subjected to special treatments to simulate postoperative conditions. Various bacterial strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus mutans, were tested. Each type of bacteria was cultured on different miniplates for specific durations, and bacterial attachment was subsequently measured and analyzed. Results Surface damage to miniplates significantly influenced bacterial attachment. Miniplates with more severe surface damage exhibited higher levels of bacterial attachment compared to undamaged miniplates. Furthermore, the type of bacteria impacted attachment levels, with certain strains demonstrating higher adhesion than others. Conclusion Surface damage to miniplates increases the risk of postoperative infections due to enhanced bacterial attachment. Therefore, maintaining the integrity of miniplates during and after orthognathic surgery is crucial. Further research is necessary to develop prevention and management strategies for postoperative infections related to miniplate surface damage.

                Background Early-life food consumption patterns may affect children’s health by increasing susceptibility to developing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Aims To evaluate Jordanian children and adolescents’ energy and macronutrient intake and how closely they adhere to dietary recommendations. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from Jordan’s Population-based Food Consumption Survey, a household population-based study conducted in Jordan between 2021 and 2022 (561 children and adolescents 8-19 years). Dietary intake was assessed using the two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall methods (24-h DR). The estimated food group and nutrient intakes were compared to nutritional recommendations, including MyPlate dietary guidelines. Results The prevalence of overweight/obese individuals based on body mass index (BMI) was 44%, and the average waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was 24.7%. Compared to MyPlate dietary guidelines, children and adolescents had a higher added sugar intake (57g/day). Also, consuming vegetables, fruits, and dairy fell short of MyPlate dietary guidelines. The total discretionary calorie intake in children and adolescents was approximately one-third of the total energy intake. Conclusion The food consumption of Jordanian children and adolescents includes high intakes of discretionary calories, with a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was elevated compared to international norms.

                Background Natural products databases are well-structured data sources that offer new molecular development opportunities in drug discovery, agrochemistry, food, cosmetics, and several other research disciplines or chemical industries. The crescent world’s interest in the development of these databases is related to the exploration of chemical diversity in geographical regions with rich biodiversity. Methods In this work, we introduce and discuss Nat-UV DB, the first natural products database from a coastal zone of Mexico. We discuss its construction, curation, and chemoinformatic characterization of their content, and chemical space coverage compared with other compound databases, like approved drugs, and other Mexican (BIOFACQUIM and UNIIQUIM databases) and the Latin American natural products database (LaNAPDB). Results Nat-UV DB comprises 227 compounds that contain 112 scaffolds, of which 52 are not present in previous natural product databases. The compounds present in Nat-UV DB have a similar size, flexibility, and polarity to previously reported natural products and approved drug datasets. Conclusions Nat-UV DB compounds have a higher structural and scaffold diversity than the approved drugs, but they have low structural and scaffold diversity in contrast with other natural products in the reference datasets. This database serves as a valuable addition to the global natural products landscape, bridging gaps in exploring biodiversity-rich regions.

                Introduction Osteochondral fractures (OCF)s of the femoral condyle are rare in pediatric patients but can have significant implications if missed or left untreated. Surgical fixation is often recommended, particularly in young, to restore joint congruency and function. Case report We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with isolated weight-bearing OCF of the lateral femoral condyle following a sports injury. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 30.4 mm osteochondral fragment confirmed by arthroscopy but unsuitable for percutaneous management due to its size and location. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed using headless compression screws, a technique reserved for those cases where based on sufficient detached fragment bone to facilitate secure fixation and bone-to-bone healing. Conclusion This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and individualized treatment to prevent long-term joint damage, contributing valuable insights into the management of pediatric femoral osteochondral fractures.

                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations.

                Background This study aims to gain insight into the effect of banks’ financial performance on their market performance. We conceptualized the research subject on the assumption that the financial performance of an organization is the most important criterion for triggering movement in its stock price. We explored various models and parameters to evaluate financial performance of banks and found CAMELS being one of the most comprehensive and appropriate model. We considered share price growth of banks to measure their stock market performance Methods We collected financial and stock market data pertaining to 32 listed Indian banks for the period 2018 to 2022. The study has employed multiple linear regression analysis of panel data for evaluating the relationship between independent and dependent variables. We adopted panel regression for data analysis and used the Prais- Winsten regression with panel corrected standard errors, as the data suffers from contemporaneous cross-sectional correlation. Results The results show that net non-performing assets, net interest margins, and return on capital have a significant negative impact on share price growth. The capital adequacy ratio and the current and savings account deposit ratios have a positive insignificant impact. The liquid asset-to-total asset ratio has a negative, insignificant impact. The coefficient of determination indicates that the share price growth of banks is more dependent on other factors which are not included in the regression analysis of this study. Conclusion This study helps investors and bankers understand the limited impact of financial parameters on banks’stock prices and to look for other parameters which explain the stock price movement better.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices.

                Background Amusia, also known as tone deafness, involves problems with the auditory accuracy of music perception and the recognition of well-known melodies. These deficits are not related to hearing loss, amount of musical training, or overall intelligence. The present study applies a screening tool for the detection of amusia in Greek children and adults. Methods The present detection tool was created via laboratory evaluation and includes seven acoustic tests: “dissonant intervals”, “out of tone”, “contour”, “memory”, “rhythm”, “integration” and “emotion”, based on the pre-existing data on the diagnostic criteria and the features of the disorder. All music stimuli were presented on a piano timbre and constructed in major mode according to Western tonal-harmonic conventions. Before administering the test, the Directorate of Primary Education of Achaia, which belongs to the Ministry of Education of Greece, approved the research for the application of the test to adults and students aged six to twelve. Simultaneously, each parent signed a form for their child’s consent to participate in the listening test. All participants were native Greek speakers, 80 students aged 6 to 12 years and 120 adults, with normal hearing thresholds bilaterally. The recorded stimuli were presented through supra-aural headphones at a comfortable hearing level, and the procedure was based on a laboratory evaluation lasting 15 min. All data were analyzed using SPSS (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25912411). Results According to the findings, only 4% of the participants suffered from amusia and it was found that those who had music education for more than two years performed better in the present test than the others. In conclusion, factors such as sex and age did not affect the occurrence of this musical disorder. Conclusion The present screening assessment tool was intended to detect individuals with amusia. There is a suspicion of the existence of amusia in the population at a rate of 4% as confirmed by other research It is recommended to administer the test to a larger sample to estimate its sensitivity and validity.

Results The three-month-long module included three sessions 1: Diabetes and its health implications 2: Diabetic foot and self-management 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices.

                Background This research investigates the unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow, heat, and mass transfer of tangent hyperbolic ternary hybrid nanofluids over a permeable stretching sheet. The study considers three types of nanoparticles—aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), copper (Cu), and titanium oxide (TiO₂)—dispersed in a base fluid of ethylene glycol (C₂H₆O₂). This ternary hybrid nanofluid (Al₂O₃–Cu–TiO₂/C₂H₆O₂) has potential applications in cooling systems, biomedical uses for targeted drug delivery and hyperthermia treatments, heat exchangers, and polymer processing techniques like extrusion and casting. Methods The study examines the effects of various parameters, including the Weissenberg number, power law index, nanoparticle volume fraction, viscous dissipation, magnetic field, heat generation, nonlinear thermal radiation, temperature ratio, Joule heating, Brownian motion, thermophoresis, porous permeability, variable thermal conductivity, Eckert number, Prandtl number, Schmidt number, chemical reaction, velocity ratio, Forchheimer number, and unsteady parameters. The governing equations are transformed into similarity equations using appropriate transformations and solved numerically with the MATLAB BVP5C package. The results are validated against data from published articles to ensure reproducibility. Results The findings reveal that an increase in the Weissenberg and Forchheimer numbers reduces the velocity profile, while the temperature distribution increases. The variable thermal conductivity parameter (Γ) leads to a higher temperature profile, indicating improved heat transfer. Higher nanoparticle concentrations in the nanofluids and hybrid nanofluids result in enhanced skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. Ternary hybrid nanofluids show the most significant improvement in heat transfer and thermal conductivity. Conclusions Ternary hybrid nanofluids significantly enhance heat and mass transfer, showing potential for applications in cooling systems, drug delivery, and polymer processing. The numerical results are consistent with previous research, confirming the reliability and reproducibility of the findings

                <p>by Paulina N. Smaruj, Fahad Kamulegeya, David R. Kelley, Geoffrey Fudenberg</p>

Interphase mammalian genomes are folded in 3D with complex locus-specific patterns that impact gene regulation. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a key architectural protein that binds specific DNA sites, halts cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and enables long-range chromatin interactions. There are hundreds of thousands of annotated CTCF-binding sites in mammalian genomes; disruptions of some result in distinct phenotypes, while others have no visible effect. Despite their importance, the determinants of which CTCF sites are necessary for genome folding and gene regulation remain unclear. Here, we update and utilize Akita, a convolutional neural network model, to extract the sequence preferences and grammar of CTCF contributing to genome folding. Our analyses of individual CTCF sites reveal four predictions: (i) only a small fraction of genomic sites are impactful; (ii) impact is highly dependent on sequences flanking the core CTCF binding motif; (iii) core and flanking nucleotides contribute largely additively to the overall impact of a site; (iv) sites created as combinations of different core and flanking sequences have impacts proportional to the product of their average impacts, i.e. they are broadly compatible. Our analysis of collections of CTCF sites make two predictions for multi-motif grammar: (i) insulation strength depends on the number of CTCF sites within a cluster, and (ii) pattern formation is governed by the orientation and spacing of these sites, rather than any inherent specialization of the CTCF motifs themselves. In sum, we present a framework for using neural network models to probe the sequences instructing genome folding and provide a number of predictions to guide future experimental inquiries.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012810">Repeated games with partner choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Graser, Takako Fujiwara-Greve, Julián García, Matthijs van Veelen</p>

Repetition is a classic mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. The standard way to study repeated games is to assume that there is an exogenous probability with which every interaction is repeated. If it is sufficiently likely that interactions are repeated, then reciprocity and cooperation can evolve together in repeated prisoner’s dilemmas. Who individuals interact with can however also be under their control, or at least to some degree. If we change the standard model so that it allows for individuals to terminate the interaction with their current partner, and find someone else to play their prisoner’s dilemmas with, then this limits the effectiveness of disciplining each other within the partnership, as one can always leave to escape punishment. The option to leave can however also be used to get away from someone who is not cooperating, which also has a disciplining effect. We find that the net effect of introducing the option to leave on cooperation is positive; with the option to leave, the average amount of cooperation that evolves in simulations is substantially higher than without. One of the reasons for this increase in cooperation is that partner choice creates endogenous phenotypic assortment. Compared to the standard models for the co-evolution of reciprocity and cooperation, and models of kin selection, our model thereby produces a better match with many forms of human cooperation in repeated settings. Individuals in our model end up interacting, not with random others that they cannot separate from, once matched, or with others that they are genetically related to, but with partners that they choose to stay with, and that are similarly dependable not to play defect as they are themselves.

                <p>by Niklas Brake, Anmar Khadra</p>

Differences in the apparent 1/f component of neural power spectra require correction depending on the underlying neural mechanisms, which remain incompletely understood. Past studies suggest that neuronal spiking produces broadband signals and shapes the spectral trend of invasive macroscopic recordings, but it is unclear to what extent action potentials (APs) influence scalp EEG. Here, we combined biophysical simulations with statistical modelling to examine the amplitude and spectral content of scalp potentials generated by the electric fields from spiking activity. In physiological parameter regimes, we found that APs contribute negligibly to the EEG spectral trend. Consistent with this, comparing our biophysical simulations with previously published data from pharmacologically paralyzed subjects suggested that the EEG spectral trend can be explained by a combination of synaptic timescales and electromyogram contamination. We also modelled rhythmic EEG generation, finding that APs can generate detectable narrowband power between approximately 60 and 1000 Hz, reaching frequencies much faster than would be possible from synaptic currents. Finally, we show that different spectral detrending strategies are required for AP generated oscillations compared to synaptically generated oscillations, suggesting that existing detrending methods for EEG spectra need to be modified for high frequency signals.

                <p>by Jacopo Marchi, Chau Nguyen Ngoc Minh, Laurent Debarbieux, Joshua S Weitz</p>

Bacteriophage (or ‘phage’ – viruses that infect and kill bacteria) are increasingly considered as a therapeutic alternative to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. However, bacteria can evolve resistance to phage, presenting a significant challenge to the near- and long-term success of phage therapeutics. Application of mixtures of multiple phages (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘cocktails’) has been proposed to limit the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants that could lead to therapeutic failure. Here, we combine theory and computational models of <i>in vivo</i> phage therapy to study the efficacy of a phage cocktail, composed of two complementary phages motivated by the example of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> facing two phages that exploit different surface receptors, LUZ19v and PAK_P1. As confirmed in a Luria-Delbr�ck fluctuation test, this motivating example serves as a model for instances where bacteria are extremely unlikely to develop simultaneous resistance mutations against both phages. We then quantify therapeutic outcomes given single- or double-phage treatment models, as a function of phage traits and host immune strength. Building upon prior work showing monophage therapy efficacy in immunocompetent hosts, here we show that phage cocktails comprised of phage targeting independent bacterial receptors can improve treatment outcome in immunocompromised hosts and reduce the chance that pathogens simultaneously evolve resistance against phage combinations. The finding of phage cocktail efficacy is qualitatively robust to differences in virus-bacteria interactions and host immune dynamics. Altogether, the combined use of theory and computational analysis highlights the influence of viral life history traits and receptor complementarity when designing and deploying phage cocktails in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.

                <p>by Sam B. Weber, Andrew J. Richardson, Christopher D. H. Thompson, Judith Brown, Fabio Campanella, Brendan J. Godley, Nigel E. Hussey, Jessica J. Meeuwig, Paul Rose, Nicola Weber, Matthew J. Witt, Annette C. Broderick</p>

Seamounts have been likened to “oases” of life in the comparative deserts of the open ocean, often harbouring high densities of threatened and exploited pelagic top predators. However, few such aggregations have been studied in any detail and the mechanisms that sustain them are poorly understood. Here, we present the findings of an integrated study of 3 previously unexplored seamounts in the tropical Atlantic, which aimed to investigate their significance as predator “hotspots” and inform their inclusion in one of world’s largest marine reserves. Baited underwater video and visual census transects revealed enhanced diversity and biomass of pelagic top predators, including elevated abundances of 7 species of sharks, predatory fish, and seabirds, within 5 km of 2 shallow seamounts (<100 m), but not a third deeper seamount (260 m). Hydroacoustic biomass of low- and mid-trophic level “prey” was also significantly elevated within 2.5 km of shallow seamounts. However, we found no evidence of enhanced primary productivity over any feature, suggesting high faunal biomass is sustained by exogenous energy inputs. Relative biomass enrichment also increased with trophic level, ranging from a 2-fold increase for zooplankton to a 41-fold increase for sharks. Tracking of the dominant predator species revealed that individual sharks (Galapagos, silky) and tuna (yellowfin, bigeye) often resided around seamounts for months to years, with evidence of connectivity between features, and (in the case of sharks) were spatially aggregated in localised hotspots that coincided with areas of high mid-trophic biomass. However, tuna and silky sharks also appeared to use seamounts as “hubs” in more extensive pelagic foraging ranges, which may help explain disproportionately high predator density. Our results reinforce the conservation significance of shallow seamounts for many marine top predators and offer fundamental insights into their functional roles as both prey “oases” and activity hubs for these species.

                Background The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between positive coping and posttraumatic growth in trauma patients, and the mediating role of positive coping and the moderating role of social understanding support. Methods 811 college students aged 18-28 with traumatic experience were selected as the research objects through the questionnaire of life-long experience of traumatic events. The survey covered many provinces in China. The purposive Rumination Scale, posttraumatic growth scale, positive coping scale and social understanding rating scale were used to investigate. Results Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between purposeful rumination, positive coping and posttraumatic growth. Regression analysis showed that purposeful rumination had a significant direct effect on posttraumatic growth (β=0.148, p<0.001). The mediation model showed that positive coping and social understanding support played a chain mediating role between purposeful rumination and posttraumatic growth, and social understanding support played a moderating role between positive coping and posttraumatic growth. Further simple slope analysis showed that when perceived social support was high, purposeful rumination did not significantly predict posttraumatic growth; When perceived social support was low, purposeful rumination had a significant positive predictive effect on posttraumatic growth, indicating that the predictive effect of purposeful rumination on posttraumatic growth gradually increased with the decrease of perceived social support. Conclusion This study reveals the complex relationship between purposeful rumination, positive coping, social understanding support and post-traumatic growth, and provides a new perspective for understanding the psychological recovery process of trauma sufferers.

The underlying mechanism involves the rearrangement of a multiprotein complex consisting of CK1α, PP2A, and AXIN. The authors further illustrate the importance of CK1α autoinhibition in colorectal cancer growth.

Genetic and physiological studies demonstrate that BCAA and Pyr synthesis are repressed in a β-lactam-resistant strain. Derepression of these pathways, genetically or by β-lactams, leads to ROS production and antibiotic sensitivity.

                Ma et al. identify that oligodendrocytes drive PD-like neurodegeneration via the prosaposin-GPR37-IL-6 axis. GPR37 is upregulated in oligodendrocytes, and prosaposin secretion is increased in parkinsonian mice. Released prosaposin could induce IL-6 upregulation and secretion from oligodendrocytes by GPR37 signaling, resulting in enhanced neuroinflammation, dopamine neuron degeneration, and behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99149">Intergenerational transport of double-stranded RNA in C. elegans can limit heritable epigenetic changes</a></h4>

              
                RNAs in circulation carry sequence-specific regulatory information between cells in plant, animal, and host-pathogen systems. Such RNA can cross generational boundaries, as evidenced by somatic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> silencing genes of matching sequence in progeny. Here we dissect the intergenerational path taken by dsRNA from parental circulation and discover that cytosolic import through the dsRNA importer SID-1 in the parental germline and/or developing progeny varies with developmental time and dsRNA substrates. Loss of SID-1 enhances initiation of heritable RNA silencing within the germline and causes changes in the expression of the <i><b>s</b>id-1</i>-<b>d</b>ependent <b>g</b>ene <i>sdg-1</i> that last for more than 100 generations after restoration of SID-1. The SDG-1 protein is enriched in perinuclear germ granules required for heritable RNA silencing but is expressed from a retrotransposon targeted by such silencing. This auto-inhibitory loop suggests how retrotransposons could persist by hosting genes that regulate their own silencing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97577">The PRC2.1 subcomplex opposes G1 progression through regulation of CCND1 and CCND2</a></h4>

              
                Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is the most highly regulated step in cellular division. We employed a chemogenetic approach to discover novel cellular networks that regulate cell cycle progression. This approach uncovered functional clusters of genes that altered sensitivity of cells to inhibitors of the G1/S transition. Mutation of components of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 rescued proliferation inhibition caused by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, but not to inhibitors of S phase or mitosis. In addition to its core catalytic subunits, mutation of the PRC2.1 accessory protein MTF2, but not the PRC2.2 protein JARID2, rendered cells resistant to palbociclib treatment. We found that PRC2.1 (MTF2), but not PRC2.2 (JARID2), was critical for promoting H3K27me3 deposition at CpG islands genome-wide and in promoters. This included the CpG islands in the promoter of the CDK4/6 cyclins CCND1 and CCND2, and loss of MTF2 lead to upregulation of both CCND1 and CCND2. Our results demonstrate a role for PRC2.1, but not PRC2.2, in antagonizing G1 progression in a diversity of cell linages, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), breast cancer, and immortalized cell lines.

">AAV serotype PHP.eB achieves superior neuronal transduction efficiency compared to AAV9 in pigtail macaques following intracerebroventricular administration</a></h4>

              
                Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are pivotal in gene therapy for neurological disorders due to their ability to enable long-term gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS). However, transducing larger brains, such as those of non-human primates (NHPs), remains challenging, necessitating alternative delivery routes and optimized capsids. This study directly compares the transduction efficiency and biodistribution of the benchmark AAV9 and its engineered derivative, AAV-PHP.eB, following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration in juvenile Macaca nemestrina. Employing a neuron-specific promoter and nuclear-localized reporter, we systematically quantified transduction across cortical, subcortical, and spinal regions. AAV-PHP.eB demonstrated significantly higher transduction rates in cortical and spinal regions compared to AAV9, despite similar expression patterns. Both vectors exhibited limited subcortical penetration and significant peripheral leakage, highlighting key challenges in CNS targeting. This is the first study to quantitatively compare AAV-PHP.eB and AAV9 in NHPs, providing valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of engineered AAV capsids for CNS gene therapy. These findings lay a critical foundation for optimizing vector designs and delivery strategies to improve outcomes in clinical applications for neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">rTCT: Rodent Triangle Completion Task to facilitate translational study of path integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration is navigation in the absence of environmental landmarks and is a primary cognitive mechanism underlying spatial memory. Path integration performance is primarily assessed in humans using the Triangle Completion Task (TCT). In humans, TCT has shown promise for the early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. In rodents, however, path integration is assessed using a wide variety of tasks but none of which currently provide a homologue for the TCT. As rodents are routinely used as preclinical models, homologous path integration tasks that result in comparable performance metrics between species are important. In the present study we developed and tested a novel rodent version of the triangle completion task to enhance cross species comparability of path integration performance. Rats were able to comprehend and perform the task. A group of Alzheimers disease model rats (TgF344-AD) exhibited similar path integration performance to their wild-type littermates; however, analysis of behavioural structure suggests use of differing behavioural strategies. This work establishes a novel rodent homologue of the triangle completion task, facilitating enhanced reverse translational study of human path integration.

">Targeted ubiquitination of NaV1.8 reduces sensory neuronal excitability</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain and addiction are a significant global health challenge. Voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.8, a pivotal driver of pain signaling, is a clinically validated target for the development of novel, non-addictive pain therapeutics. Small molecule inhibitors against NaV1.8 have shown promise in acute pain indications, but large clinical effect sizes have not yet been demonstrated and efficacy in chronic pain indications are lacking. An alternative strategy to target NaV1.8 channels for analgesia is to reduce the number of channels that are present on nociceptor membranes. We generated a therapeutic heterobifunctional protein, named UbiquiNaV, that contains a NaV1.8-selective binding module and the catalytic subunit of the NEDD4 E3 Ubiquitin ligase. We show that UbiquiNav significantly reduces channel expression in the plasma membrane and reduces NaV1.8 currents in rodent sensory neurons. We demonstrate that UbiquiNaV is selective for NaV1.8 over other NaV isoforms and other components of the sensory neuronal electrogenisome. We then show that UbiquiNaV normalizes the distribution of NaV1.8 protein to distal axons, and that UbiquiNaV normalizes the neuronal hyperexcitability in in vitro models of inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Our results serve as a blueprint for the design of therapeutics that leverage the selective ubiquitination of NaV1.8 channels for analgesia.

">Hexagonal modulation of theta rhythmic attentional sampling of visual space</a></h4>

              
                Spatial attention improves visual perception by selecting behaviorally relevant sensory signals. Traditionally, attention has been conceptualized as a static spotlight, while recent evidence posited that attention operates as a moving spotlight that samples visual space sequentially in discrete snapshots that are clocked by theta rhythms (~3-8 Hz). While theta rhythmic attentional sampling has mainly been observed in fronto-parietal and occipital areas, theta oscillations also hallmark entorhinal-hippocampal grid-cell networks, which encode physical space in hexagonal patterns that guide overt exploration and navigation. We hypothesized that visual attention might rely on the same underlying principles and sample visual space in a hexagonal, grid-like configuration. To test this hypothesis, twenty participants performed a cue-guided attention task that probed behavioral performance as a function of space and time. Reaction times were assessed as a function of spatial location and varying cue-target intervals, which revealed prominent, spatially-structured theta rhythms. Specifically, higher theta power was evident at spatial locations that were aligned to multiples of 60 degrees, consistent with an underlying hexagonal organization. Participants that exhibited stronger hexagonal sampling relied less on the spatial cue to guide their attentional allocation. In sum, these findings suggest that covert visual attention relies on an underlying hexagonal grid-like structure known from the entorhinal-hippocampal system and highlight that theta rhythms reflect a common organizing principle for spatial cognition.

">Spatial coding supports auditory conceptual navigation</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in human entorhinal cortex encode spatial layouts for real-world navigation, yet their role in conceptual navigation remains unclear. Here we show that mentally transforming tones within a purely auditory pitch-duration space engages spatial circuits, and that such resources are causally necessary. In Experiment 1, participants trained for five days to navigate through a purely conceptual pitch-duration auditory space, then underwent fMRI on Day 6. We observed a six-fold modulation of entorhinal BOLD signals aligned to each participant's trajectory angles, similar to grid-cell firing in physical space. Stronger grid-like coding predicted larger training-related gains. In Experiment 2, a new cohort performed the same task under either a spatial or non-spatial interference load. Only the spatial condition selectively disrupted performance on trials requiring mental "movement," indicating a causal reliance on spatial resources. These findings provide evidence that auditory conceptual transformations recruit--and depend on--spatial grid-like computations in the entorhinal-hippocampal system, pointing to a domain-general role for spatial coding in organizing new knowledge along continuous dimensions.

">Axon collateral pattern of a sparse locus coeruleus norepinephrine neuron in mouse cerebral cortex.</a></h4>

              
                The locus coeruleus (LC) contains predominantly norepinephrine (NE) neurons with widespread axonal projections throughout the brain and plays a critical role in the control of behavior, particularly arousal. Historically, the LC-NE system was thought to perform this function by releasing NE uniformly throughout most brain regions. However, recent evidence suggests that the cortical projections of the LC are modularly organized, allowing coordination of diverse and sometimes opposing functions, such as fear memory formation and extinction. However, many details remain unclear, and answers require data from axon collaterals of sparse neurons. We modified a viral tracing protocol using a dual recombinase system to trace the axonal collaterals of sparse LC neurons projecting to the cingulate cortex (CgC). Our results show that even a small number of LC neurons still have broad cortical projections, but the pattern is not uniform. There are a few major projections with dense fibers and numerous minor projections with sparse innervation. Notably, the major projections, including the rostrosplenial cortex, dorsal hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and CgC (the injection site for retrograde viral labeling), are functionally related and may coordinate goal-directed navigation. In conclusion, our results suggest that a single LC neuron projects divergently and non-uniformly to the cortex, with major projections coordinating related cortical areas to regulate specific functions, while minor projections appear less functionally specific. It's likely that these minor projections contribute to the overall maintenance of arousal throughout the brain.

">Epidermal Langerhans Cells Drive Painful Diabetic Neuropathy in a Sex-dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                The interaction between non-neuronal cells and nerve endings in the epidermis significantly influences the development of various diseases, including Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN). PDN is a common and challenging complication of diabetes, characterized by changes in skin innervation accompanied by neuropathic pain. While there is growing evidence that epidermal non-neuronal cells, such as resident immune cells, play a crucial role in the progression of PDN, the underlying mechanisms of this neuropathy remain poorly understood. In our studies, we utilized transgenic methods, pain behavioral assessments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in a clinically relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of PDN and skin biopsy samples from PDN patients, to investigate the role of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in this condition. We observed an increased density of LCs in the skin of PDN male mice coinciding with the onset of mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, we found that LCs density correlated with small fiber degeneration in HFD mice and skin biopsies taken from well-characterized PDN patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly, the selective ablation of LCs using a diphtheria-toxin strategy was found to prevent nociceptive behavior in male mice. This indicates that LCs are both necessary and sufficient for the development of mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain in HFD male mice. Interestingly, when LCs were ablated in HFD female mice, it did not prevent but rather promoted pain behavior, suggesting the existence of sex-specific mechanisms mediated by LCs. scRNAseq transcriptomic analysis of the paw epidermis from HFD mice, which included both males and females, revealed significant sex-mediated differences in the expression of specific target genes within this PDN model. In male mice, scRNAseq identified differentially expressed genes associated with axonal guidance and immune responses in LCs. Additionally, by integrating single-cell RNA data from the epidermis and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male mice, we uncovered altered communication between LCs and cutaneous afferents through Semaphorin-Plexin signaling pathways in PDN. These findings highlight LCs as key contributors to the development of PDN and suggest their potential as therapeutic targets for innovative treatments, particularly topical therapies aimed at modulating immune cell activity and neuroimmune communication in the skin. Our investigations of male and female mice indicate that LCs may play different roles in mechanical sensation under both normal and pathological conditions, such as PDN. This underscores the importance of considering sex differences when developing more effective treatments.

">Separable Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Projections mediate the Facets of Loneliness-like state</a></h4>

              
                Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species. Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive, elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity, interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRNDAT), which we previously implicated in social motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRNDAT projections - to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) - play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRNDAT-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRNDAT-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRNDAT-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRNDAT neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRNDAT photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRNDAT photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli- suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic need state of the individual.

A recent functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study at 7T demonstrated for the first time layer-specific responses in the human dlPFC during working memory. Superficial layers were more active during the delay period when working memory items needed to be manipulated compared to mere maintenance. In contrast, deeper layers were more active during the motor response to a probe compared to non-action. Like many current layer fMRI studies, this study relied on several manual and semi-manual processing steps, including the selection of regions of interest. To test the replicability of these findings, we conducted a pre-registered replication of this study in 21 subjects using a fully automated and reproducible analysis pipeline. Our results do not show the same layer-specific effects. Although we observed higher activity in the superficial layers in response to working memory manipulation during the delay period, we did not find any evidence for stronger deep layer involvement during motor response in the probe period. We argue that our results are biologically plausible in light of previous research as well as methodological considerations inherent in layer fMRI acquisition and analysis. Consequently, we conclude that the evidence regarding the functional role of different layers within the human dlPFC during working memory remains inconclusive. A focus on replicability, reproducibility, and a better understanding of the influence of methodological choices will help layer fMRI become a more routine tool in cognitive neuroscience.

">An invariant schema emerges within a neural network during hierarchical learning of visual boundaries</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits must balance plasticity and stability to enable continual learning without catastrophic forgetting, a pervasive feature of artificial neural networks trained using end-to-end learning (e.g. backpropagation). Here, we apply an alternative, hierarchical learning algorithm to the cognitive task of boundary detection in video clips. In contrast to backpropagation, hierarchical training converges to a network executing a fixed schema and generates firing statistics consistent with single-neuron recordings from human subjects performing the same task. The hierarchically trained network's schema circuit remains invariant following training on sparse data, with additional data serving to refine the upstream representation.

">Genes with disrupted connectivity in the architecture of schizophrenia gene co-expression networks highlight atypical neuronal-glial interactions</a></h4>

              
                Dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is a pervasive trait across various levels of systems biology. To better understand disrupted patterns of molecular connectivity distinguishing schizophrenia from control non-clinical populations, we applied novel approaches to gene co-expression networks in large samples of postmortem brains from multiple regions relevant to schizophrenia: the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex- (DLPFC) (Ndonors=297), hippocampus (Ndonors=250) and caudate (Ndonors=349). We identified differentially connected genes (DCGs) in schizophrenia networks that deviated from architectural relationships characteristic of control gene co-expression networks, by assessing three network metrics - total connectivity (K), clustering coefficient (C), and intra-module degree (kIn) determined by projecting the modular community structure of the control networks onto the schizophrenia co-expression networks. Genes showing significant absolute case-control differences for these metrics (i.e., irrespective of difference directionality) were then tested for their relationships with common genetic variants conferring risk of schizophrenia and their biological significance through post-GWAS analyses (stratified LDSC and MAGMA), gene ontology annotations and enrichment in schizophrenia-relevant gene sets. We identified multiple DCGs, with case-control differences of connectivity metrics, consistent across brain regions. When parsed by parameter specificity, these genes show shared and specific enrichment in schizophrenia genetic signal, biological ontologies and selected cell-type markers. Notably these findings revealed widespread disturbances in co-expression connectivity affecting both neuronal and glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes. Overall, our results highlight disrupted co-expression network architecture in schizophrenia, implicating disrupted neuronal-glial crosstalk and its effect on synaptic transmission.

	<p>Background: Childhood-onset progressive ataxias are rare neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cerebellar signs, sometimes associated with other neurological or extra-neurological features. The autosomal dominant forms, known as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), linked to trinucleotide (i.e., CAG) repeat disorders, are ultra-rare in children. We describe three patients from two unrelated families affected by spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and present a literature review of pediatric cases. Methods: The patients&amp;amp;rsquo; clinical and genetic data were collected retrospectively. Results: The first case was a 9.5-year-old boy, affected by ataxia with oculomotor apraxia and cerebellar atrophy, subcortical myoclonus, and peripheral axonal sensitive polyneuropathy caused by a pathologic expansion in ATXN2, inherited from his asymptomatic father. Two brothers with familial SCA2 presented neurodegeneration leading to early death in one case and progressive ataxia, parkinsonism, and epilepsy with preserved ambulation at age 18 years in the second. To date, 19 pediatric patients affected by SCA2 have been reported, 3 of whom had a phenotype consistent with progressive ataxia with shorter CAG repeats, while 16 had more severe early-onset encephalopathy, with longer alleles. Conclusions: Although they are ultra-rare, trinucleotide repeat disorders must be considered in differential diagnosis of hereditary progressive ataxias in children, especially considering that they require targeted genetic testing and can manifest even before a parental carrier becomes symptomatic. Thus, they must also be taken into account with negative family history and when Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) results are inconclusive. Notably, the association between cerebellar ataxia and other movement disorders should raise suspicion of SCA2 among differential diagnoses.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The main objective of this systematic review was to explore the role of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-concussion syndrome (PCS). We aimed to evaluate the potential of some MEG biomarkers in detecting subtle brain abnormalities often missed by conventional imaging techniques. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using 25 studies that administered MEG to examine mTBI and PCS patients. The quality of the studies was assessed based on selection, comparability, and outcomes. Studies were analyzed for their methodology, evaluated parameters, and the clinical implications of using MEG for mTBI diagnosis. Results: MEG detected abnormal brain oscillations, including increased delta, theta, and gamma waves and disruptions in functional connectivity, particularly in the default mode and frontoparietal networks of patients suffering from mTBI. MEG consistently revealed abnormalities in mTBI patients even when structural imaging was normal. The use of MEG in monitoring recovery showed significant reductions in abnormal slow-wave activity corresponding to clinical improvements. Machine learning algorithms applied to MEG data demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing mTBI patients from healthy controls and predicting clinical outcomes. Conclusions: MEG provides a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool for mTBI and PCS by identifying subtle neurophysiological abnormalities. The high temporal resolution and the ability to assess functional brain networks make MEG a promising complement to conventional imaging. Future research should focus on integrating MEG with other neuroimaging modalities and standardizing MEG protocols for clinical use.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent research suggests that video games may serve as cognitive training tools to enhance visual working memory (VWM) capacity. However, the effectiveness of game-based cognitive training remains debated, and the underlying neural mechanisms, as well as the relationship between training efficacy and game design factors, are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of video game training on VWM capacity and explore its neural correlates. Methods: Two groups underwent 56 daily 20 min training sessions with two distinct video games targeting different cognitive skills: a reaction-time training game and a VWM-specific training game. Behavioral assessments included accuracy, hit response times, correct rejection response times, and Cowan&amp;amp;rsquo;s K values. Neural correlates were measured through Negative Slow Wave (NSW) activity using EEG. Decision tree classification analyses were applied to NSW data across sessions and set sizes to identify patterns linked to VWM capacity. Results: Preliminary results are that both groups showed improvements in behavioral measures (accuracy, response times, and Cowan&amp;amp;rsquo;s K values). NSW analyses revealed a main effect of set size in both groups, and classification results indicated that NSW patterns differed between groups, across sessions, and set sizes, supporting the relationship between NSW and VWM capacity. Conclusions: These findings contribute to understanding NSW as a neurophysiological correlate of VWM capacity, demonstrating its plasticity through video game training. Simple video games could effectively enhance behavioral and neural aspects of VWM, encouraging their potential as accessible cognitive training tools.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting one in five adults globally and is a major risk factor for anxiety (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B15">Goldberg and McGee, 2011</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B23">Lurie, 2018</cross-ref>). Given the current dearth of available treatments for both individuals living with chronic pain and mental illnesses, there is a critical need for research into the molecular mechanisms involved in order to discover novel treatment targets. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions, and investigations of this process may provide better understanding of the mechanisms driving the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found contrasting roles for BECLIN-1 in the development of pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner. Remarkably, we found that male SNI mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function demonstrated heightened mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared with male wild-type SNI mice, while female SNI mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function demonstrated similar thresholds to the female wild-type SNI mice. We also found that disruptions of BECLIN-1 prevented SNI-induced increases in anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. Our data thus indicate that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotional components of chronic pain in male but not female mice.</p>

                <p>Food intake is controlled by multiple converging signals: hormonal signals that provide information about energy homeostasis and hedonic and motivational aspects of food and food cues that can drive nonhomeostatic or "hedonic" feeding. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a brain region implicated in the hedonic and motivational impact of food and food cues, as well as consumption of rewards. Disinhibition of VP neurons has been shown to generate intense hyperphagia, or overconsumption. While VP GABA neurons have been implicated in cue-elicited reward-seeking and motivation, the role of these neurons in the hyperphagia resulting from VP activation remains unclear. Here, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs to activate VP GABA neurons in nonrestricted male and female rats during chow and sucrose consumption. We found that activation of VP GABA neurons increases consumption of chow and sucrose in male rats, but not female rats. Together, these findings suggest that activation of VP GABA neurons can stimulate consumption of routine or highly palatable rewards selectively in male rats.</p>

                <p>by Belinda Lombard, Harry Moultrie, Juliet R.C. Pulliam, Cari van Schalkwyk</p>

Given the high global seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the risk of reinfection has become increasingly important. Models developed to track trends in reinfection risk should be robust against possible biases arising from imperfect data observation processes. We performed simulation-based validation of an existing catalytic model designed to detect changes in the risk of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. The catalytic model assumes the risk of reinfection is proportional to observed infections. Validation involved using simulated primary infections, consistent with the number of observed infections in South Africa. To assess the performance of the catalytic model, we simulated reinfection datasets that incorporated different processes that may bias inference, including imperfect observation and mortality. A Bayesian approach was used to fit the model to simulated data, assuming a negative binomial distribution around the expected number of reinfections, and model projections were compared to the simulated data using different magnitudes of change in reinfection risk. We assessed the model’s ability to accurately detect changes in reinfection risk when included in the simulations, as well as the occurrence of false positives when reinfection risk remained constant. The model parameters converged in most scenarios leading to model outputs aligning with anticipated outcomes. The model successfully detected changes in the risk of reinfection when such a change was introduced to the data. Low observation probabilities (10%) of both primary- and reinfections resulted in low numbers of observed cases from the simulated data and poor convergence. The model’s performance was assessed on simulated data representative of the South African SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, reflecting its timing of waves and outbreak magnitude. Model performance under similar scenarios may be different in settings with smaller epidemics (and therefore smaller numbers of reinfections). Ensuring model parameter convergence is essential to avoid false-positive detection of shifts in reinfection risk. While the model is robust in most scenarios of imperfect observation and mortality, further simulation-based validation for regions experiencing smaller outbreaks is recommended. Caution must be exercised in directly extrapolating results across different epidemiological contexts without additional validation efforts.

Vaccines which can transmit from vaccinated to unvaccinated animals may be especially useful for increasing immunity in hard to reach populations or in populations where achieving high coverage is logistically infeasible. However, gauging the public health utility for future use of such transmissible vaccines and assessing their risk-benefit tradeoff, given their potential for unintended evolution, hinges on accurate estimates of their indirect protective effect. Here, we establish the conditions under which a two-stage randomized field trial can characterize the protective effects of a transmissible vaccine relative to a traditional vaccine. We contrast the sample sizes required to adequately power these trials when the vaccine is weakly and strongly transmissible. We also identify how required sample sizes change based on the characteristics of host ecology such as the overdispersion of the contact structure of the population, as well as the efficacy of the vaccine and timing of vaccination. Our results indicate the range of scenarios where two-stage randomized field trial designs are feasible and appropriate to capture the protective effects of transmissible vaccines. Our estimates identify the protective benefit of using transmissible vaccines compared to traditional vaccines, and thus can be used to weigh against evolutionary risks.

                <p>by Nathanaël Hozé, Margarita Pons-Salort, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Michael White, Henrik Salje, Simon Cauchemez</p>

Population-based serological surveys are a key tool in epidemiology to characterize the level of population immunity and reconstruct the past circulation of pathogens. A variety of serocatalytic models have been developed to estimate the force of infection (FOI) (i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected) from age-stratified seroprevalence data. However, few tool currently exists to easily implement, combine, and compare these models. Here, we introduce an R package, <i>Rsero</i>, that implements a series of serocatalytic models and estimates the FOI from age-stratified seroprevalence data using Bayesian methods. The package also contains a series of features to perform model comparison and visualise model fit. We introduce new serocatalytic models of successive outbreaks and extend existing models of seroreversion to any transmission model. The different features of the package are illustrated with simulated and real-life data. We show we can identify the correct epidemiological scenario and recover model parameters in different epidemiological settings. We also show how the package can support serosurvey study design in a variety of epidemic situations. This package provides a standard framework to epidemiologists and modellers to study the dynamics of past pathogen circulation from cross-sectional serological survey data.

                <p>by Grace C. McKenzie-Smith, Scott W. Wolf, Julien F. Ayroles, Joshua W. Shaevitz</p>

Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the <i>D. melanogaster</i> circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of <i>D. melanogaster</i> behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.

                <p>by Irene Ojeda-Naharros, Tirthasree Das, Ralph A. Castro, J. Fernando Bazan, Christian Vaisse, Maxence V. Nachury</p>

The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is an essential regulator of body weight homeostasis. MC4R is unusual among GPCRs in that its activity is regulated by 2 opposing physiological ligands, the agonist ⍺-MSH and the antagonist/inverse agonist AgRP. Paradoxically, while MC4R localizes and functions at the cilium of hypothalamic neurons, the ciliary levels of MC4R are very low under unrestricted feeding conditions. Here, we find that the constitutive activity of MC4R is responsible for the continuous depletion of MC4R from cilia and that inhibition of MC4R’s activity via AgRP leads to a robust accumulation of MC4R in cilia. Ciliary targeting of MC4R is mediated by its partner MRAP2 and the constitutive exit of MC4R from cilia relies on the sensor of activation β-arrestin, on ubiquitination, and on the BBSome ciliary trafficking complex. Thus, while MC4R exits cilia via conventional mechanisms, it only accumulates in cilia when its activity is suppressed by AgRP.

                <p>by Bernardo Papini Gabiatti, Johanna Krenzer, Silke Braune, Timothy Krüger, Martin Zoltner, Susanne Kramer</p>

Nuclear export of mRNAs requires loading the mRNP to the transporter Mex67/Mtr2 in the nucleoplasm, controlled access to the pore by the basket-localised TREX-2 complex and mRNA release at the cytoplasmic site by the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5. Asymmetric localisation of nucleoporins (NUPs) and transport components as well as the ATP dependency of Dbp5 ensure unidirectionality of transport. Trypanosomes possess homologues of the mRNA transporter Mex67/Mtr2, but not of TREX-2 or Dbp5. Instead, nuclear export is likely fuelled by the GTP/GDP gradient created by the Ran GTPase. However, it remains unclear, how directionality is achieved since the current model of the trypanosomatid pore is mostly symmetric. We have revisited the architecture of the trypanosome nuclear pore complex using a novel combination of expansion microscopy, proximity labelling and streptavidin imaging. We could confidently assign the NUP76 complex, a known Mex67 interaction platform, to the cytoplasmic site of the pore and the NUP64/NUP98/NUP75 complex to the nuclear site. Having defined markers for both sites of the pore, we set out to map all 75 trypanosome proteins with known nuclear pore localisation to a subregion of the pore using mass spectrometry data from proximity labelling. This approach defined several further proteins with a specific localisation to the nuclear site of the pore, including proteins with predicted structural homology to TREX-2 components. We mapped the components of the Ran-based mRNA export system to the nuclear site (RanBPL), the cytoplasmic site (RanGAP, RanBP1) or both (Ran, MEX67). Lastly, we demonstrate, by deploying an auxin degron system, that NUP76 holds an essential role in mRNA export consistent with a possible functional orthology to NUP82/88. Altogether, the combination of proximity labelling with expansion microscopy revealed an asymmetric architecture of the trypanosome nuclear pore supporting inherent roles for directed transport. Our approach delivered novel nuclear pore associated components inclusive positional information, which can now be interrogated for functional roles to explore trypanosome-specific adaptions of the nuclear basket, export control, and mRNP remodelling.

                <p>by Huaji Jiang, Yingchao Xie, Zhiqiang Hu, Jiansen Lu, Jiahuan Zhang, Hongyu Li, Ke Zeng, Wenqiang Peng, Cheng Yang, Junsheng Huang, Zelong Han, Xiaochun Bai, Xiao Yu</p>

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and potentially life-threatening inflammatory disease of gastroenteric tissue characterized by episodes of intestinal inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we explore the role and precise mechanism of Van-Gogh-like 2 (VANGL2) during the pathogenesis of IBD. VANGL2 decreases in IBD patients and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Myeloid VANGL2 deficiency exacerbates the progression of DSS-induced colitis in mice and specifically enhances the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950 effectively alleviates DSS-induced colitis in VANGL2 deficient mice. Mechanistically, VANGL2 interacts with NLRP3 and promotes the autophagic degradation of NLRP3 through enhancing the K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 823 of NLRP3 by recruiting E3 ligase MARCH8, leading to optineurin (OPTN)-mediated selective autophagy. Notably, decreased VANGL2 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from IBD patients results in overt NLRP3 inflammasome activation and sustained inflammation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that VANGL2 acts as a repressor of IBD progression by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provides insights into the crosstalk between inflammation and autophagy in preventing IBD.

                Background Body gesture recognition has become a fundamental technique in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As human-machine interaction evolves, there is an increasing need for precise and efficient gesture detection systems. However, current methods face limitations such as accuracy constraints, high computational complexity, and limited adaptability. This study addresses these challenges by proposing an innovative approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of body gesture recognition systems. Methods The proposed system integrates advanced algorithms and techniques to improve performance. A Marker-Based Watershed Algorithm is employed for accurate image segmentation, enhancing region detection. Feature extraction uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while a Wavelet Transform-Based Pre-Processing technique improves input data quality. A unique component of this method is the application of the Crow Search Algorithm to optimize model efficiency. An Optimized Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is utilized for gesture classification, aiming to increase precision and computational effectiveness. Results The proposed approach achieves a gesture recognition accuracy rate of 99%. Compared to traditional methods such as Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Improved Neural Networks (INN), the Optimized PNN demonstrates a 2.21% improvement in overall accuracy. The implementation, carried out in Python, showcases the robustness and adaptability of the system across diverse HCI applications. Conclusions This work presents a comprehensive solution to the challenges of body gesture recognition by integrating cutting-edge algorithms. Combining the Marker-Based Watershed Algorithm, CNN-based feature extraction, and Crow Search Optimization significantly enhances the system’s accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the shortcomings of existing methods, this approach provides a more responsive, reliable, and flexible gesture recognition system, contributing to the advancement of HCI technologies. The results demonstrate the potential for improved human-computer interaction through more effective and precise gesture detection.

                Claywell et al. show that Toxoplasma egress is controlled by a negative feedback loop. PKAc1 is activated after invasion to inhibit egress by targeting processes between cGMP production and Ca2+ signaling. PKAc1 activation of PDE2 serves to deplete cAMP, thus downregulating PKAc1 activity and permitting egress through the PKG/CDPK pathway.

                Garofalo et al. identify serotonin as a platelet-derived factor that modulates fear behaviors in mice through the control of inhibitory neurotransmission and plasticity in the hippocampus. Further, these findings highlight natural killer cells as central actors in contributing to the gut-platelet-brain dialogue.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98934">Template switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive gene amplification</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variants (CNVs) are an important source of genetic variation underlying rapid adaptation and genome evolution. Whereas point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA features, the role of genome architecture in the formation and evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we found the <i>GAP1</i> gene in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> undergoes frequent amplification and selection in glutamine-limitation. The gene is flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTRs) and proximate to an origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which likely promote rapid <i>GAP1</i> CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we evolved engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements in glutamine-limited chemostats. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. Removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the fitness effect of <i>GAP1</i> CNVs and the rate of adaptation. In 177 CNV lineages, across all four strains, between 26% and 80% of all <i>GAP1</i> CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, distal ones mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination can mediate gene amplification following <i>de novo</i> retrotransposon events. Our study reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive CNVs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97764">Single-cell sequencing provides clues about the developmental genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations in syngnathid fishes</a></h4>

              
                Seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons are fishes from the family Syngnathidae that have evolved extraordinary traits including male pregnancy, elongated snouts, loss of teeth, and dermal bony armor. The developmental genetic and cellular changes that led to the evolution of these traits are largely unknown. Recent syngnathid genome assemblies revealed suggestive gene content differences and provided the opportunity for detailed genetic analyses. We created a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas of Gulf pipefish embryos to understand the developmental basis of four traits: derived head shape, toothlessness, dermal armor, and male pregnancy. We completed marker gene analyses, built genetic networks, and examined the spatial expression of select genes. We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express regulatory genes <i>bmp4, sfrp1a</i>, and <i>prdm16</i>. We found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, and we observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor. Finally, we found that epidermal cells expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the brooding environment. The examined pipefish evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, suggesting that derived features originate from changes within existing gene networks. Future work addressing syngnathid gene networks across multiple stages and species is essential for understanding how the novelties of these fish evolved.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87078">Live imaging of excitable axonal microdomains in ankyrin-G-GFP mice</a></h4>

              
                The axon initial segment (AIS) constitutes not only the site of action potential initiation, but also a hub for activity-dependent modulation of output generation. Recent studies shedding light on AIS function used predominantly post-hoc approaches since no robust murine in vivo live reporters exist. Here, we introduce a reporter line in which the AIS is intrinsically labeled by an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion protein activated by Cre recombinase, tagging the native <i>Ank3</i> gene. Using confocal, superresolution, and two-photon microscopy as well as whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro, ex vivo<i>,</i> and in vivo, we confirm that the subcellular scaffold of the AIS and electrophysiological parameters of labeled cells remain unchanged. We further uncover rapid AIS remodeling following increased network activity in this model system, as well as highly reproducible in vivo labeling of AIS over weeks. This novel reporter line allows longitudinal studies of AIS modulation and plasticity in vivo in real-time and thus provides a unique approach to study subcellular plasticity in a broad range of applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93633">Volumetric trans-scale imaging of massive quantity of heterogeneous cell populations in centimeter-wide tissue and embryo</a></h4>

              
                We established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of ×2 and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a transverse spatial resolution of approximately 1.1 µm across an FOV of approximately 1.5×1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hr, visualizing the movement of over 4.0×10<sup>5</sup> vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87527">Dendritic growth and synaptic organization from activity-independent cues and local activity-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic branching and synaptic organization shape single-neuron and network computations. How they emerge simultaneously during brain development as neurons become integrated into functional networks is still not mechanistically understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic model in which dendrite growth and the organization of synapses arise from the interaction of activity-independent cues from potential synaptic partners and local activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Consistent with experiments, three phases of dendritic growth – overshoot, pruning, and stabilization – emerge naturally in the model. The model generates stellate-like dendritic morphologies that capture several morphological features of biological neurons under normal and perturbed learning rules, reflecting biological variability. Model-generated dendrites have approximately optimal wiring length consistent with experimental measurements. In addition to establishing dendritic morphologies, activity-dependent plasticity rules organize synapses into spatial clusters according to the correlated activity they experience. We demonstrate that a trade-off between activity-dependent and -independent factors influences dendritic growth and synaptic location throughout development, suggesting that early developmental variability can affect mature morphology and synaptic function. Therefore, a single mechanistic model can capture dendritic growth and account for the synaptic organization of correlated inputs during development. Our work suggests concrete mechanistic components underlying the emergence of dendritic morphologies and synaptic formation and removal in function and dysfunction, and provides experimentally testable predictions for the role of individual components.

                Decoders for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) assume constraints on neural activity, chosen to reflect scientific beliefs while yielding tractable computations. Recent scientific advances suggest that the true constraints on neural activity, especially its geometry, may be quite different from those assumed by most decoders. We designed a decoder, MINT, to embrace statistical constraints that are potentially more appropriate. If those constraints are accurate, MINT should outperform standard methods that explicitly make different assumptions. Additionally, MINT should be competitive with expressive machine learning methods that can implicitly learn constraints from data. MINT performed well across tasks, suggesting its assumptions are well-matched to the data. MINT outperformed other interpretable methods in every comparison we made. MINT outperformed expressive machine learning methods in 37 of 42 comparisons. MINT’s computations are simple, scale favorably with increasing neuron counts, and yield interpretable quantities such as data likelihoods. MINT’s performance and simplicity suggest it may be a strong candidate for many BCI applications.

">Channel-mediated astrocytic volume transient is required for synaptic plasticity and spatial memory</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes, known for their support roles, are emerging as active participants in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. Astrocytes actively regulate synaptic plasticity and memory through dynamic volume transients. Our previous research identified several key molecules, including TREK-1, TRPA1, and Best1 ion channels, as well as the gliotransmitter BDNF, as critical components of astrocytic volume transients. However, the precise mechanisms by which these volume transients influence synaptic plasticity and memory remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the roles of TREK-1 and TRPA1 in astrocytic volume dynamics and their downstream effects. Using intrinsic optical signal imaging, electrophysiology, and behavioral assays, we demonstrate that neuronal stimulation induces astrocytic swelling, initiated by K+ uptake through TREK-1 channels and regulated by Ca2+ influx via TRPA1 channels. This swelling is closely associated short- and long-term potentiation, and is accompanied by the release of BDNF, which restores long-term potentiation under conditions of calcium sequestration during astrocytic calcium clamping experiments. Disruption of astrocytic volume transient associated ion channels results in significant deficits in spatial memory, as evidenced by impairments in object-place recognition and passive avoidance tasks. Furthermore, these channels were found to modulate the synaptic plasticity. These findings reveal astrocytic volume transients and BDNF as pivotal modulators of synaptic plasticity and memory, as well as potential therapeutic targets for addressing memory dysfunctions.

">Exploring Synergies in Brain-Machine Interfaces: Compression vs. Performance</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with severe neurological injuries often rely on assistive technologies, but current methods have limitations in accurately decoding multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) movements. Intracortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) use neural signals to provide a more natural control method, but currently struggle with higher-DoF movements--something the brain handles effortlessly. It has been theorized that the brain simplifies high-DoF movement through muscle synergies, which link multiple muscles to function as a single unit. These synergies have been studied using dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and demixed PCA (dPCA) and successfully used to reduce noise and improve offline decoder stability in non-invasive applications. However, their effectiveness in improving decoding and generalizability for implanted recordings across varied tasks is unclear. Here, we evaluated if brain and muscle synergies can enhance iBMI performance in non-human primates performing a two-DoF finger task. Specifically, we tested if PCA, dPCA, and NMF could compress and denoise brain and muscle data and improve decoder generalization across tasks. Our results showed that while all methods effectively compressed data with minimal loss in decoding accuracy, none improved performance through denoising. Additionally, none of the methods enhanced generalization across tasks. These findings suggest that while dimensionality reduction can aid data compression, alone it may not reveal the "true" control space needed to improve decoder performance or generalizability. Further research is required to determine whether synergies are the optimal control framework or if alternative approaches are required to enhance decoder robustness in iBMI applications.

">Estradiol promotes habituation learning via an unidentified target, bypassing the suppressive effects of established Estrogen Receptors</a></h4>

              
                Habituating to the constant stimuli in the environment is a critical learning process conserved across species. We use a larval zebrafish visual response to sudden darkness as a model for studying habituation learning, where zebrafish reduce their responses to repeated stimulations. In this paradigm, treatment with estradiol strongly increases learning rate, resulting in more strongly suppressed responses. We used mutant lines for the Estrogen Receptors (esr1, esr2a, esr2b, gper1) in an attempt to identify the receptor(s) mediating these effects. These experiments failed to identify a necessary receptor (or combination of receptors). Surprisingly, esr1, esr2a, and gper1 mutants showed weak but consistent increases in habituation, indicating these receptors suppress habituation learning. These experiments demonstrate that estradiol is a complex modulator of learning in our model, where the learning-promoting effects are mediated by an unidentified estradiol target, and the classical Estrogen Receptors act in competition to subtly suppress learning.

">Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) restores ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activity after chronic opioid exposure</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged exposure to Gi/o receptor agonists such as opioids can lead to a sensitization of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), resulting in heterologous sensitization or cyclic AMP (cAMP) overshoot. The molecular consequences of cAMP overshoot are not well understood, but this adaptive response is suggested to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. We found that genetic reduction of AC1 and simultaneous upregulation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits, SUR1 or Kir6.2, significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and reduced naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In vitro models utilized an EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor to investigate sensitization of adenylyl cyclase in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and HEK{Delta}AC3/6 knockout cells. Acute application of DAMGO significantly decreased the cAMP signal from the EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor, while chronic DAMGO administration resulted in enhanced cAMP production following AC stimulation. Inhibition of cAMP overshoot was observed with naloxone (NAL), pertussis toxin (PTX), and the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), as well as co-expression of {beta}-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminus ({beta}ARK-CT). After establishment of the AC1-EPAC sensitization in the in vitro models, we found that inhibition of AC1 or EPAC enhanced potassium channel activity after chronic morphine treatment, using a thallium-based assay in SH-SY5Y cells. Similar data were obtained in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after chronic morphine treatment. This study presents evidence for investigating further AC1 signaling as a target for opioid tolerance and withdrawal, by increasing EPAC activity and affecting potassium channels downstream of opioid receptors.

">Huntingtin inclusion bodies have distinct immunophenotypes and ubiquitination profiles in the Huntington's disease human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the gene encoding the huntingtin (Htt) protein. The accumulation of Htt inclusion bodies is a pathological hallmark of HD and a common target for therapeutic strategies. However, the limited efficacy of treatments targeting the Htt protein highlights the need for a better understanding of the role of Htt inclusion bodies in HD pathogenesis. This study examined the heterogeneity of Htt inclusion body composition by co-labelling with three Htt epitope-specific antibodies to characterize Htt inclusion body 'immunophenotype'. We then characterized the size and sub-cellular location of Htt inclusions with distinct immunophenotypes. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry, we also examined the ubiquitination profile of each immunophenotype. Our findings demonstrate that Htt inclusions have a range of immunophenotypes, with some labelled by only one of the three antibodies and others exhibiting co-labelling by several antibodies, thus demonstrating the heterogeneity in inclusion composition and structure. We outline evidence that inclusion bodies exclusively labelled with the EM48 antibody are small, non-nuclear, and more abundant in HD cases with increased CAG repeat length, higher Vonsattel grade, and earlier age of onset. We also find that Htt inclusion bodies labelled by multiple antibodies are more likely to be ubiquitinated, predominantly by K63- rather than K48-linked ubiquitin, suggesting preferential degradation by autophagy. Lastly, we show that ubiquitinated Htt inclusion bodies are more highly immunoreactive for ubiquilin 2 than p62. Our findings highlight the need for multiple antibodies to capture the full spectrum of Htt pathology in HD and imply that future studies should consider the diversity of inclusion body composition and structure when correlating pathology formation to neurodegeneration, clinical symptoms, or disease severity.

">Mental exploration of future choices during immobility theta oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Mental exploration enables flexible evaluation of potential future choices, guiding decision-making without requiring direct real-world iterations. Although the hippocampus is known to be active while imagining the future, the precise mechanisms that support mental exploration of future choices remain unclear. In the hippocampus, the theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) is prevalent during movement and supports memory coding during real-world exploration by organizing neuronal activity patterns into short virtual path segments (theta sequences) around the rat's location. We observed these theta-related neural activity patterns during movement in a hippocampus-dependent working memory task and also, unexpectedly, theta oscillations and theta-related neural activity during immobility. Compared to standard theta sequences during movement, theta sequences during immobility differed in that they occurred at a shifted theta phase and preferentially represented remote locations, in particular the next choice in the working memory task. Coding for future locations was also observed during awake sharp wave ripple, but these short-lasting events occurred rarely and were biased toward frequently visited locations. Therefore, our findings suggest that recurring bouts of theta oscillations during immobility, which are also observed in primates and humans, support the cognitive demands of mental exploration in the hippocampal network and facilitate ongoing predictions of future choices.

">Active zone maturation state controls synaptic output and release mode and is differentially regulated by neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Synapse formation requires the gradual accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs) to support neurotransmitter release. To correlate AZ maturation with synaptic output, quantal imaging was performed at serially imaged time-stamped Drosophila synapses. Evoked release strength correlated strongly with AZ age and accumulation of late AZ scaffolds, while immature sites lacking VDCC accumulation supported spontaneous release. To examine how neuronal activity regulates AZ maturation and protein accumulation, the effects of disruptions to SV fusion or action potential generation were analyzed. Decreasing neuronal activity reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of presynaptic material at existing AZs. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in rab3 mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation state sets distinct presynaptic release modes and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.

">Multi-output computation by single neuron biophysics in a visual system</a></h4>

              
                As long anticipated (Sandberg and Bostrom 2008; Seung 2012; Szigeti et al. 2014), connectomics is providing a new foundation for brain simulation by replacing theoretical assumptions about network connectivity with solid empirical facts. Connectomics also yields detailed information about neuronal morphology, which is useful for simulating the biophysics of single neurons (Yang et al. 2016; Meier and Borst 2019; T. X. Liu et al. 2022). Here I introduce a formalism for simulating a brain as a network of synapses interacting via an effective resistance matrix. By computing this matrix for fly visual interneurons, I find evidence that some neurons may be true multi-output devices, neither well approximated as point neurons (Lappalainen et al. 2024; Shiu et al. 2024), nor as collections of functionally independent compartments (Meier and Borst 2019). Within a linear approximation, such a neuron is instead equivalent to a hierarchy of virtual neurons that spatially pool over multiple length scales. The computational powers of multi-output neurons may support highly sophisticated normalizations in the fly visual system (Seung 2024a).

">Fmr1 KO causes delayed rebound spike timing in mediodorsal thalamocortical neurons through regulation of HCN channel activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: The neurodevelopmental disorder Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene which prevents FMRP production. FMRP modulates the expression and function of a wide variety of proteins, including voltage-gated ion channels such as Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide gated (HCN) channels, which are integral to rhythmic activity in thalamic structures. Thalamocortical pathology, particularly involving the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. MD connectivity with mPFC is integral to executive functions like working memory and social behaviors that are disrupted in FXS. Methods: We used a combination of retrograde labeling and ex vivo brain slice whole cell electrophysiology in 40 wild type and 42 Fmr1 KO male mice to investigate how a lack of Fmr1 affects intrinsic cellular properties in lateral (MD-L) and medial (MD-M) MD neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons). Results: In MD-L neurons, Fmr1 knockout caused a decrease in HCN-mediated membrane properties such as voltage sag and membrane afterhyperpolarization. These changes in subthreshold properties were accompanied by changes in suprathreshold neuron properties such as the variability of action potential burst timing. Conclusions: In Fmr1 knockout mice, reduced HCN channel activity in MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons impairs both the timing and magnitude of HCN-mediated membrane potential regulation. Changes in response timing may adversely affect rhythm propagation in Fmr1 KO thalamocortical circuitry. MD thalamic neurons are critical for maintaining rhythmic activity involved in cognitive and affective functions. Understanding specific mechanisms of thalamocortical circuit activity may lead to therapeutic interventions for individuals with FXS.

">Post-Ictal Gamma Oscillations Predict Hippocampal Structural Integrity in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The underlying histopathology and epileptic network of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) are difficult to ascertain. Here, we report a novel electrical activity following seizure termination, termed post-ictal gamma oscillations (PIGOs), recorded in mice with intrahippocampal kainic acid injection and a patient with mTLE. PIGOs are characterized by a spectral shift of increased power in gamma frequencies relative to decreased power in other frequencies, generating a gamma peak. PIGOs are accompanied by increased intracellular calcium levels among parvalbumin-positive interneurons and a direct current shift. Only a subgroup of animals in the study had PIGOs. These animals had less pronounced hippocampal sclerosis (HS) than those without PIGOs. To illustrate the translational potential of these findings, we analyzed data from two patients with unilateral mTLE, one with PIGOs and the other without. The patient with PIGOs had symmetrical hippocampi on neuroimaging, whereas the other exhibited overly decreased interictal glucose uptake in left hippocampus, suggesting left-sided HS. After receiving laser ablation of mesial temporal regions, the patient with PIGOs became seizure-free, whereas the other did not. Our results suggest that PIGOs may serve as a biomarker for a milder form of HS in patients with mTLE and for predicting treatment outcomes.

">Protein-Like Polymer for Inhibition of Tau Fibril Propagation in Human-Derived Models of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The misfolding, aggregation, and spread of tau protein fibrils underlie tauopathies, a diverse class of neurodegenerative diseases for which effective treatments remain elusive. Among these are corticobasal dementia (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), canonical examples of 4-repeat (4R) tauopathies characterized by tau isoforms exclusively with four microtubule-binding repeat domains. We target this 4R tau isoform-specific mechanism by focusing on misfolded tau's distinctive stem-loop-stem structural motif formed by the junction of the 4R-defining alternatively spliced exon and the adjacent constitutive exon. A synthetic peptide based on this stem-loop-stem sequence can induce aggregation and spread in an isoform-specific manner. Here, we develop a protein-like polymer (PLP) in which multiple copies of this synthetic peptide form a brush-like structure capable of preventing tau aggregation by binding and capping fibril ends in vitro, in human brain organoids, and in cellular models with an EC50 of 105 +/- 14 nM. PLPs demonstrate robust activity against fibrils derived from CBD and PSP patient brains and a PS19 mouse tauopathy model. Previous tau-targeted treatments have primarily focused on broad tau clearance, aggregation inhibition, or microtubule stabilization, often lacking isoform specificity and precision. In contrast, this approach targets the 4R tau isoform's unique structural motif, offering a tailored therapeutic intervention for diseases like CBD and PSP. Supported by prior studies showing blood-brain barrier penetrance and safety profiles, this tau-binding PLP offers a promising translational path toward clinical applications in tauopathy treatment.

">The NeflE397K mouse model demonstrates muscle pathology and motor function deficits consistent with CMT2E</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people and represents a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies characterized by progressive motor and sensory dysfunction. CMT type 2E is a result of mutations in the neurofilament light (NEFL) gene with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance, often presenting with a progressive neuropathy with distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, gait disturbances, foot deformities, reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV) without demyelination and typically reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude values. Several Nefl mouse models exist that either alter the mouse Nefl gene or overexpress a mutated human NEFL transgene, each recapitulating various aspects of CMT2E disease. We generated the orthologous NEFLE396K mutation in the mouse C57BL/6 background, NeflE397K. In a separate report, we extensively characterized the electrophysiology deficits and axon pathology in NeflE397K mice. In this manuscript, we report our characterization of NeflE397K motor function deficits, muscle pathology and changes in breathing Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice demonstrated progressive motor coordination deficits and muscle weakness through the twelve months of age analyzed, consistent with our electrophysiology findings. Additionally, Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice showed alterations in muscle fiber area, diameter and composition as disease developed. Lastly, Nefl mutant mice showed increased number of apneas under normoxia conditions and increased erratic breathing as well as tidal volume under respiratory challenge conditions. NeflE397K/E397K mice phenotypes and pathology were consistently more severe than Nefl+/E397K mice. Collectively, these novel CMT2E models present with a clinically relevant phenotype and make it an ideal model for the evaluation of therapeutics.

">Regulation of hippocampal excitatory synapse development by the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2/ADGRB2)</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic synapses and their associated dendritic spines are critical information processing sites within the brain. Proper development of these specialized cellular junctions is important for normal brain functionality. Synaptic adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) have been identified as regulators of synapse development and function. While two members of the Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI/ADGRB) subfamily of synaptic aGPCRs, BAI1/ADGRB1 and BAI3/ADGRB3, have been found to mediate synapse and spine formation, BAI2/ADGRB2 function remains uncharacterized at the synapse. Here, we show that endogenous BAI2 is expressed throughout the nervous system with prominent expression in synapse dense regions of the hippocampus. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, BAI2 is highly enriched at large postsynaptic sites, defined by the size of the postsynaptic scaffold PSD95. Loss of BAI2 negatively impacts glutamatergic synapses across development in dissociated hippocampal cultures. In contrast, GABAergic synapse density is unchanged. Furthermore, BAI2 deficient neurons have significant alterations in spine morphology with decreased density of mature PSD95-containing mushroom-shaped spines compared with wild-type neurons. Interestingly, no major alterations in dendritic complexity were observed in BAI2 deficient neurons, in contrast to previous results for the other BAIs. The reduction in mature mushroom-shaped spine is commensurate with a reduction in spine volume and head diameter. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the aGPCR BAI2 is an important regulator of glutamatergic synapse and PSD95-associated spine development in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results expand the knowledge of the BAI subfamily of aGPCRs in mediating excitatory synapse and spine development and highlight differences unique to BAI2.

">Shared Alteration of Whole-Brain Connectivity and Olfactory Deficits in Multiple Autism Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disconnection condition influenced by both heterogeneous genetic and environmental factors, yet it remains unclear whether common connectivity deficits exist. Here, we demonstrate that different ASD-linked mutations lead to distinct circuit abnormalities but share deficits in the piriform cortex and olfactory discrimination. Using advanced artificial intelligence, we developed a whole-brain mapping platform to analyze the distribution of the Thy1-YFP projection neurons in three ASD mouse models (Tbr1+/-, Nf1+/-, Vcp+/R95G). Our analysis revealed changes in axonal patterns and neuronal distribution, indicating deficits in projection neuron differentiation and maintenance. Notably, the piriform cortex consistently exhibited reduced YFP+ cells and signals and impaired functionality across all models. Visual and somatosensory cortices were also affected, but the patterns varied. These findings highlight that the sensory regions, especially the piriform cortex, are susceptible to ASD-related mutations, strengthening the notion that different sensory experiences are common in ASD.

">On CA1 ripple oscillations: reevaluating asynchronicity evidence</a></h4>

              
                Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the stratum radiatum. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal-interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits.

">Association of human gut microbiota with Alzheimers disease pathogenesis: An exploratory clinical study</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and the brain-gut axis has garnered increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of the brain-gut axis in AD pathogenesis, with a specific focus on microbiota composition. This exploratory study enrolled 10 patients with AD and 13 healthy adults, grouped by age ([&le;]30 years, 31-40 years, and [&ge;]41 years). Fecal samples were collected, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to analyze differences in fecal microbiota composition at the bacterial species level. Certain bacterial species appeared more abundant in the AD group (e.g., Ruminococcus inulinivorans and Ruminococcus torques), while others were relatively more abundant in healthy adults (e.g., Prevotella vulgatus 1, Bacteroides wexlerae, Clostridium butyricum, and Alistipes rectalis). However, these differences were not statistically significant, likely because of the limited sample size. These findings suggest that fecal microbiota composition may differ between patients with AD and healthy individuals, with a potential intermediate group at risk of AD development. Larger-scale clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the bacterial species associated with AD pathogenesis, potentially enabling the use of microbiota composition as a screening tool to distinguish between healthy individuals, patients with AD, and those with preclinical AD.

Methods: Subjects with PBD (n = 23) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 23) underwent (a) clinical assessments encompassing the severity of psychiatric symptoms, (b) neuropsychological evaluation, (c) analyses of event-related potentials (related to the passive viewing of fearful, neutral, and happy faces during electroencephalography recording, and (d) cortical thickness and deep gray matter volume measurement using magnetic resonance imaging. Canonical correlation analyses were used to assess the relationships between these dimensions. Results: Youth with PBD had higher levels of anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and borderline personality features (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), greater commission errors for negative stimuli (p = 0.003), delayed deliberation time (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and smaller risk adjustment scores (p = 0.002) than HCs. Furthermore, they showed cortical thinning in the frontal, parietal, and occipital areas (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and greater P300 for happy faces (p = 0.29). In youth with PBD, cortical thickening and P300 amplitude positively correlated with more commission errors for negative stimuli, longer deliberation times, reduced risk adjustment, higher levels of panic and separation anxiety, and greater levels of negative relationships, whereas they negatively correlated with levels of depression (overall loadings &amp;amp;gt; or &amp;amp;lt;0.3). Limitations: Small sample size, cross-sectional design, and limited variables investigated. Conclusions: This preliminary work showed that multimodal assessment might be a viable tool for providing a pathophysiological model that unifies brain and behavioral alterations in youth with PBD.</p>

	<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. ASD encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and functional impairments, ranging from mild to severe. Despite its prevalence, the underlying physiopathological mechanisms of ASD remain largely unknown, resulting in a lack of effective targeted therapeutic interventions, contributing to significant financial and emotional burdens on affected families and the healthcare system. Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway may impair the activity of monoaminergic and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent neurons in individuals with ASD. To explore this potential mechanism, we conducted a systematic review to analyze such impairments to gather information on whether the off-label use of BH4 could represent a novel pharmacological approach for managing ASD. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature from four databases: PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane Library, and SciELO, from January 1967 to December 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle&amp;amp;ndash;Ottawa scale. The inclusion criteria for this systematic review focused on identifying articles published in English that contained the following keywords, used in various combinations: autism, ASD, autism spectrum disorder, BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin, neopterin, NO, nitric oxide. The analysis was performed between December 2020 and December 2021. The collected data demonstrated that BH4 metabolism was altered in individuals with ASD. Lower levels of BH4 were reported in biological samples from ASD-affected individuals compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Additionally, neopterin levels were elevated in plasma and urine, but decreased in cerebrospinal fluid, while nitric oxide levels were consistently reported to be higher across studies. Treatment with BH4 has shown potential in improving ASD-related symptoms. The reported increase in neopterin in biological fluids indicates inflammation, while the reduction in BH4 levels suggests a potential shift in its metabolic role. Specifically, BH4 may be diverted from its primary role in neurotransmitter synthesis to function as an antioxidant or to perpetuate inflammation through NO production. Given that BH4 is a critical cofactor in monoaminergic neurotransmission, its dysfunction highlights the molecule&#039;s therapeutic potential. BH4, already FDA-approved for other conditions, emerges as a promising off-label candidate to alleviate ASD symptomatology.</p>

">Prenatal adversity configures a subpopulation of ventral dentate granule cells for recruitment to drive innate anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Adverse prenatal environment is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. Although studies have implicated epigenetic mechanisms, little is known about how epigenomic changes come about and lead to abnormal behaviors in affected individuals. We sought to identify epigenomic and transcriptomic signatures induced by a proinflammatory gestational environment in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), a hippocampal region linked to avoidance of threatening contexts, that persist and promote anxiety-like behavior in mice. Here we show that adversity shifted the methylation of enhancers and promoters with intermediate methylation and altered synapse-related gene expression, resulting in epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in the vDG. Exposure to an anxiogenic environment recruited vDG neurons with the most transcriptional alterations. Differentially expressed synapse-relevant genes in ensemble neurons tended to be differentially methylated. Finally, this ensemble exhibited higher activity in threatening than safe environment suggesting a prenatal adversity-induced epigenetic and neurobiological sequence that leads to anxiety.

	<p>Background/Objectives Studies in rodents indicate that disruptions in both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathways are involved in the development of hyperactive behavior. We examined whether vinpocetine, a phosphodiesterase type 1 inhibitor that enhances brain cAMP and cGMP levels, could mitigate locomotor hyperactivity in mice exposed to lead during early development. Methods Swiss mice were exposed to 90 ppm of lead in their drinking water throughout gestation and the first ten postnatal days. At postnatal day 10 (PN10), blood lead levels (BLLs) were about 30 &amp;amp;micro;g/dL. At PN30, animals either received vinpocetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or a vehicle 4 h before the evaluation of locomotor activity in the open field. Results Lead-exposed males did not display differences in locomotor activity compared to controls, while lead-exposed females showed a significant increase in locomotion. Vinpocetine treatment significantly reversed the lead-induced hyperactivity in females. Conclusions These findings suggest that the cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways play a role in the hyperactivity induced by lead exposure.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The neurodegenerative processes driving the build-up of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis (P-MS) have not been fully elucidated. Recent data link cellular senescence (CS) to neurodegeneration. We investigated for evidence of CS in P-MS and sought to determine its pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 53BP1, p16, and lipofuscin as markers of CS in white matter lesions (WMLs), normal appearing white matter (NAWM), normal appearing cortical gray matter (NAGM), control white matter (CWM), and control gray matter (CGM) on autopsy material from patient with P-MS and healthy controls. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts were significantly increased in WMLs and GMLs, compared with NAWM, CWM, NAGM, and CGM and lipofuscin<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in WMLs, compared with NAWM and CWM, indicating more abundant CS in demyelinated lesions. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cells in WMLs were significantly increased compared with NAWM and CWM. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> and p16<sup>+</sup> cells were found significantly more abundant in acute active WMLs and GMLs, compared with chronic inactive lesions. Co-localization studies showed evidence of CS in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. Among the quantified CSF SASP factors, IL-6, MIF, and MIP1a levels correlated with 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAGM, whereas IL-10 levels correlated with p16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAWM. P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in WMLs exhibited an inverse correlation with time to requiring a wheelchair and with age at death.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicates that CS primarily affects actively demyelinating gray and WMLs. A higher senescent cell load in P-MS is associated with faster disability progression and death. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective is to evaluate cognitive and behavioral progression and identify early predictors of these changes in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 161 ALS patients were tested at diagnosis (T0), and 107 were re-tested after 1 year (T1) using cognitive/behavioral tests. All patients underwent whole-genome sequencing, and 46 patients (ALS-normal cognition [CN]) underwent [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 161 patients, 107 were re-rested at T1; non-retested patients included 10 with frontotemporal dementia and 44 who were either non-testable or deceased. At T0, 67 patients (62.6%) were classified as ALS-CN, whereas 40 (38.4%) showed some degree of cognitive/behavioral impairment. Eighteen ALS-CN patients (26.9%) experienced cognitive decline at T1. Phenoconverters had lower baseline scores in letter fluency (Letter Fluency Test [FAS]) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Both tests were independently predictive of phenoconversion in binary logistic regression models, with optimal cut-off scores of 28.75 and 14.2, with good sensitivity and specificity. Other predictors included older age, lower education, and ALS-related genetic variants. Phenoconverters were hypometabolic in the left temporal lobe. Thirteen (32.5%) of the 40 patients with cognitive impairment at T0 worsened by T1, with FAS (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the ECAS verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.023) predicting further decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately 30% of ALS patients experienced cognitive/behavioral decline within the first year after diagnosis. FAS and ECAS verbal fluency were predictive of cognitive phenoconversion. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection of at-risk individuals and the need for longitudinal cognitive assessments to monitor disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Several recent studies, enabled by advances in neuroimaging methods and large-scale datasets, have identified areas in human ventral visual cortex that respond more strongly to food images than to images of many other categories, adding to our knowledge about the broad network of regions that are responsive to food. This finding raises important questions about the evolutionary and developmental origins of a possible food-selective neural population, as well as larger questions about the origins of category-selective neural populations more generally. Here, we propose a framework for how visual properties of food (particularly color) and nonvisual signals associated with multimodal reward processing, social cognition, and physical interactions with food may, in combination, contribute to the emergence of food selectivity. We discuss recent research that sheds light on each of these factors, alongside a broader account of category selectivity that incorporates both visual feature statistics and behavioral relevance.

                He et al. report that activation of glutamatergic neurons in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis induces thirst-driven sniffing behaviors through the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to preBötzinger complex circuit, thereby enhancing water-seeking efficiency. This circuit represents a crucial pathway that integrates internal thirst signals with specific respiratory motor outputs.

                Background Primiparous mothers face diverse challenges during pregnancy and post-childbirth. There is limited data on the effectiveness of postnatal educational programs for new mothers (Subramanian et al., 2020). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an educational program designed to improve primiparous mothers’ attitudes toward newborn communication, general health, feeding, and swallowing. The objectives were (1) to develop an attitude questionnaire (AQ), a parent education program [Newborn Communication, Health, Feeding and Swallowing Education Program (N-CHFSEP)], and a feedback questionnaire (FQ); and (2) to estimate the efficacy of N-CHFSEP pre- and post-delivery. The research, conducted between August 2023 and February 2024, involved 98 primiparous mothers who gave birth to healthy newborns through any delivery method. Participants were proficient in English or Kannada. The study excluded mothers delivering multiples, those with significant medical or psychological issues, and health professionals. Methods The study had two phases: Phase 1 developed and validated the AQ, N-CHFSEP, and FQ. N-CHFSEP covered key topics, including milestones in communication, feeding, and general health from birth to 6 months. Phase 2 administered these tools to participants. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and chi-square tests. Results 93% of mothers reported increased confidence in recognizing communication, feeding, and health-related signs in their infants after completing the program. This change was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Sociodemographic factors like maternal age, education, occupation, and family type significantly influenced confidence levels. Feedback from participants highlighted the program’s effectiveness in enhancing knowledge, with suggestions for improvements. Conclusions N-CHFSEP significantly boosted mothers’ confidence in newborn care, contributing to better maternal and infant health. However, the study lacked a control group, and the effectiveness was evaluated only immediately after the program. Future research could incorporate practical demonstrations and hands-on training to further enhance the program’s impact.

                <p>by Xu Shi, Xiao Wang, Lu Jin, Leena Halakivi-Clarke, Robert Clarke, Andrew F. Neuwald, Jianhua Xuan</p>

We develop a Bayesian approach, BayesIso, to identify differentially expressed isoforms from RNA-seq data. The approach features a novel joint model of the sample variability and the deferential state of isoforms. Specifically, the within-sample variability and the between-sample variability of each isoform are modeled by a Poisson-Lognormal model and a Gamma-Gamma model, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the differential state of each isoform and the model parameters are jointly estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Extensive studies using simulation and real data demonstrate that BayesIso can effectively detect isoforms of less differentially expressed and differential transcripts for genes with multiple isoforms. We applied the approach to breast cancer RNA-seq data and uncovered a unique set of isoforms that form key pathways associated with breast cancer recurrence. First, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and PTEN signaling pathways are identified as being involved in breast cancer development. Further integrated with protein-protein interaction data, pathways of Jak-STAT, mTOR, MAPK and Wnt signaling are revealed in association with breast cancer recurrence. Finally, several pathways are activated in the early recurrence of breast cancer. In tumors that occur early, members of pathways of cellular metabolism and cell cycle (such as CD36 and TOP2A) are upregulated, while immune response genes such as NFATC1 are downregulated.

                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27186?af=R">Neuroimaging Predictors of Cognitive Resilience against Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Some individuals demonstrate greater cognitive resilience—the ability to maintain cognitive performance despite adverse brain-related changes—through as yet unknown mechanisms. We examined whether cortical thickness in several brain regions confers resilience against cognitive decline in amyloid-positive adults by moderating the effects of thinner cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions and of higher levels of tau.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid-positive participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with relevant imaging data were included (n = 160, observations = 473). Risk factors included an AD brain signature and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. Cognitive measures were episodic memory and executive function composites. Mixed effects models tested whether region-specific cortical thickness moderated relationships between markers of AD risk and memory or executive function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cross-sectionally, thicker cortex in 8 regions minimized the negative impact of thinner cortex/smaller volume in AD signature regions on executive function. Longitudinally, higher baseline thickness in a composite of these 8 regions predicted less memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and weakened negative effects of phosphorylated tau on memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.014), independent of baseline cognition and risk markers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified 8 cortical regions that appear to confer cognitive resilience cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the face of established indicators of AD pathology. Brain regions fostering executive function may enable compensation in later memory performance and confer cognitive resilience against effects of phosphorylated tau and AD-related cortical changes. These “resilience” regions suggest the value of focusing on brain regions beyond only those determined to be AD-related and may partially explain variability in AD-related cognitive trajectories.
