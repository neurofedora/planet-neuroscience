              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03784">Neural Models of Task Adaptation: A Tutorial on Spiking Networks for Executive Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cognitive flexibility and task-switching mechanisms in neural systems requires biologically plausible computational models. This tutorial presents a step-by-step approach to constructing a spiking neural network (SNN) that simulates task-switching dynamics within the cognitive control network. The model incorporates biologically realistic features, including lateral inhibition, adaptive synaptic weights through unsupervised Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and precise neuronal parameterization within physiologically relevant ranges. The SNN is implemented using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, which represent excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) populations. We utilize two real-world datasets as tasks, demonstrating how the network learns and dynamically switches between them. Experimental design follows cognitive psychology paradigms to analyze neural adaptation, synaptic weight modifications, and emergent behaviors such as Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), Long-Term Depression (LTD), and Task-Set Reconfiguration (TSR). Through a series of structured experiments, this tutorial illustrates how variations in task-switching intervals affect performance and multitasking efficiency. The results align with empirically observed neuronal responses, offering insights into the computational underpinnings of executive function. By following this tutorial, researchers can develop and extend biologically inspired SNN models for studying cognitive processes and neural adaptation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05972">Node-reconfiguring multilayer networks of human brain function</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.05972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional brain network properties are heavily influenced by how the the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), i.e., predetermined collections of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement voxels, as nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines, which can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer links quantify the overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs with intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15078">Functional dissociations versus post-hoc selection: Moving beyond the Stockart et al. (2025) compromise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stockart et al. (2025) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that may be far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11395">Targeting C99 Mediated Metabolic Disruptions with Ketone Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of ketone bodies in Alzheimers disease (AD) remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding their influence on amyloid pathology. While beta}hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been implicated in neuroprotection, direct evidence for its effects on amyloid beta(Abeta) deposition, aggregation, or clearance is lacking. Furthermore, whether BHB acts as a disease modifying factor or merely confers transient metabolic benefits remains unclear. Addressing this gap is crucial for evaluating the therapeutic potential of ketone metabolism in AD. Here, we investigated the impact of ketone bodies on amyloidogenic toxicity using a Drosophila melanogaster model with targeted expression of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta secretase 1 (BACE1), Abeta, and the C99 fragment, an essential intermediate in Abeta generation. Surprisingly, we found that Abeta alone elicited minimal neurotoxicity, whereas C99 expression induced pronounced pathological effects, suggesting a critical, underappreciated role of C99 in AD progression. Further analysis revealed that C99 driven toxicity was associated with autophagic and lysosomal dysfunction, leading to impaired protein clearance, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Using confocal microscopy and lysosomal pH sensitive markers, we demonstrated that BHB treatment restored lysosomal function and alleviated these pathological changes. Protein protein interaction network analysis in C99 expressing Drosophila brains identified protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 (PPME1) activation as a key driver of autophagic impairment, further supported by machine learning predictions. Finally, mathematical similarity analysis of PPI networks suggested that BHB may exert its neuroprotective effects through mTOR inhibition, positioning it as a potential endogenous modulator of AD related pathology.

Abstract: Unlike traditional vision-only models, vision language models (VLMs) offer an intuitive way to access visual content through language prompting by combining a large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder. However, both the LLM and the vision encoder come with their own set of biases, cue preferences, and shortcuts, which have been rigorously studied in uni-modal models. A timely question is how such (potentially misaligned) biases and cue preferences behave under multi-modal fusion in VLMs. As a first step towards a better understanding, we investigate a particularly well-studied vision-only bias - the texture vs. shape bias and the dominance of local over global information. As expected, we find that VLMs inherit this bias to some extent from their vision encoders. Surprisingly, the multi-modality alone proves to have important effects on the model behavior, i.e., the joint training and the language querying change the way visual cues are processed. While this direct impact of language-informed training on a model's visual perception is intriguing, it raises further questions on our ability to actively steer a model's output so that its prediction is based on particular visual cues of the user's choice. Interestingly, VLMs have an inherent tendency to recognize objects based on shape information, which is different from what a plain vision encoder would do. Further active steering towards shape-based classifications through language prompts is however limited. In contrast, active VLM steering towards texture-based decisions through simple natural language prompts is often more successful.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04224">Speeding up Local Search for the Indicator-based Subset Selection Problem by a Candidate List Strategy</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the indicator-based subset selection problem involves finding a subset of points that maximizes a given quality indicator. Local search is an effective approach for obtaining a high-quality subset in this problem. However, local search requires high computational cost, especially as the size of the point set and the number of objectives increase. To address this issue, this paper proposes a candidate list strategy for local search in the indicator-based subset selection problem. In the proposed strategy, each point in a given point set has a candidate list. During search, each point is only eligible to swap with unselected points in its associated candidate list. This restriction drastically reduces the number of swaps at each iteration of local search. We consider two types of candidate lists: nearest neighbor and random neighbor lists. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed candidate list strategy on various Pareto fronts. The results show that the proposed strategy with the nearest neighbor list can significantly speed up local search on continuous Pareto fronts without significantly compromising the subset quality. The results also show that the sequential use of the two lists can address the discontinuity of Pareto fronts.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing can reduce the energy requirements of neural networks and holds the promise to `repatriate' AI workloads back from the cloud to the edge. However, training neural networks on neuromorphic hardware has remained elusive. Here, we instead present a pipeline for training spiking neural networks on GPUs, using the efficient event-driven Eventprop algorithm implemented in mlGeNN, and deploying them on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip. Our benchmarking on keyword spotting tasks indicates that there is almost no loss in accuracy between GPU and Loihi 2 implementations and that classifying a sample on Loihi 2 is up to 10X faster and uses 200X less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

                arXiv:2503.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the optimal policy from a random network initialization is the theme of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08352">Data augmentation with automated machine learning: approaches and performance comparison with classical data augmentation methods</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.08352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is arguably the most important regularization technique commonly used to improve generalization performance of machine learning models. It primarily involves the application of appropriate data transformation operations to create new data samples with desired properties. Despite its effectiveness, the process is often challenging because of the time-consuming trial and error procedures for creating and testing different candidate augmentations and their hyperparameters manually. State-of-the-art approaches are increasingly relying on automated machine learning (AutoML) principles. This work presents a comprehensive survey of AutoML-based data augmentation techniques. We discuss various approaches for accomplishing data augmentation with AutoML, including data manipulation, data integration and data synthesis techniques. The focus of this work is on image data augmentation methods. Nonetheless, we cover other data modalities, especially in cases where the specific data augmentations techniques being discussed are more suitable for these other modalities. For instance, since automated data integration methods are more suitable for tabular data, we cover tabular data in the discussion of data integration methods. The work also presents extensive discussion of techniques for accomplishing each of the major subtasks of the image data augmentation process: search space design, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. Finally, we carried out an extensive comparison and analysis of the performance of automated data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art methods based on classical augmentation approaches. The results show that AutoML methods for data augmentation currently outperform state-of-the-art techniques based on conventional approaches.

	<p>Background: Childhood is a crucial period for brain development, and short-term juvenile stress has demonstrated long-lasting effects on cognitive and cellular functions in the hippocampus. However, the influence of such stress on the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall network remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the effects of transient wild stress on juvenile male rats. Pregnant rats were purchased and housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment, with pups separated by sex on postnatal day 21 (PD21). From PD27 to PD29, male rats were subjected to transient wild stress, which included forced swimming, elevated platform exposure, and restraint stress. Following stress exposure, all animals were carefully maintained and scanned at 42 days of age (PD42) using fMRI. Structural analysis was performed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess changes in gray matter volume, while functional activity was evaluated through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and voxel-wise functional connectivity. Results: The results showed significant reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions in the stress group, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), entorhinal cortex (Ent), and dentate gyrus (DG). In terms of functional activity, cortical regions, particularly the primary somatosensory areas, exhibited decreased activity, whereas increased activity was observed in the PAG, DG, and medulla. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant reduction in connectivity between the DG and entorhinal cortex, while the DG-PAG connectivity was significantly enhanced. Conclusions: These findings suggest that juvenile stress leads to profound alterations in both brain structure and function, potentially disrupting emotional regulation and memory processing by affecting the development and connectivity of key brain regions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The widespread phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, named the Oxford Word of the Year 2024, refers to the cognitive decline and mental exhaustion experienced by individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, due to excessive exposure to low-quality online materials, especially on social media. The present study is exploratory and interpretative in nature, aiming to investigate the phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, with a focus on its key pillars, psychological factors, digital behaviors, and the cognitive impact resulting from the overconsumption of low-quality digital content. Methods: This study employs a rapid review approach, examining research published between 2023 and 2024 across PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. It explores the causes and effects of brain rot, focusing on the overuse of social media, video games, and other digital platforms. Results: The findings reveal that brain rot leads to emotional desensitization, cognitive overload, and a negative self-concept. It is associated with negative behaviors, such as doomscrolling, zombie scrolling, and social media addiction, all linked to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors impair executive functioning skills, including memory, planning, and decision-making. The pervasive nature of digital media, driven by dopamine-driven feedback loops, exacerbates these effects. Conclusions: The study concludes by offering strategies to prevent brain rot, such as controlling screen time, curating digital content, and engaging in non-digital activities. Given the increasing prevalence of digital engagement, it is essential to explore a variety of strategies, including mindful technology use, to support cognitive health and emotional well-being. The results can guide various stakeholders&amp;amp;mdash;policymakers, practitioners, researchers, educators, and parents or caregivers&amp;amp;mdash;in addressing the pervasive impact of brain rot and promoting a balanced approach to technology use that fosters cognitive resilience among adolescents and young adults.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-155/v2?src=rss">Enhancing prostate cancer detection: The role of b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient in DWI [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

                Background Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy primarily in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile, however, it has been shown that its effectiveness and the reduction of nephrotoxicity depend on maintaining adequate therapeutic levels. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPk) models attempt to parameterize the behavior of plasma concentrations in different target populations and scenarios such as renal replacement therapy, to successful therapeutic outcome and avoid these side effects. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), through a search in PubMed, LILACS, OVID Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE Journals, Google Scholar and previous known registers of PopPk models in non-critically ill adult patients, published between 1998 and 2024. Results A total of 190 papers were fully screened, of which were included 36 studies conducted in different populations; 12 in general population, 23 in special populations (surgical, with impaired renal function, obese, elderly, with cancer and cystic fibrosis), and 1 in mixed population (general and with cancer). The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies used internal evaluation and 4 of them used an external group. Discussion The technology for the development and implementation of PopPk models requires experts in clinical pharmacology and is limited to university and research centers. The software is mostly expensive and, in most cases, the pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and evaluation methods depend on which compartmental model, parameters, covariates and software have been used. Conclusions These models require validation in the clinical context and conducting experiments to adapt them for precision dosing in different subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1507/v3?src=rss">Complications following miniplate insertion in maxillofacial fractures: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0005-24.2025?rss=1">Detection of Mitotic Neuroblasts Provides Additional Evidence of Steady-State Neurogenesis in the Adult Small Intestinal Myenteric Plexus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maintenance of normal structure of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which regulates key gastrointestinal functions, requires robust homeostatic mechanisms, since by virtue of its location within the gut wall, the ENS is subject to constant mechanical, chemical, and biological stressors. Using transgenic and thymidine analog-based experiments, we previously discovered that neuronal turnover&mdash;where continual neurogenesis offsets ongoing neuronal loss at steady state&mdash;represents one such mechanism. Although other studies confirmed that neuronal death continues into adulthood in the myenteric plexus of the ENS, the complicated nature of thymidine analog presents challenges in substantiating the occurrence of adult neurogenesis. Therefore, it is vital to employ alternative, well-recognized techniques to substantiate the existence of adult enteric neurogenesis in the healthy gut. Here, by using established methods of assessing nuclear DNA content and detecting known mitotic marker phosphor-histone H3 (pH3) in Hu<sup>+</sup> adult ENS cells, we show that ~10% of adult small intestinal myenteric Hu<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and ~20% of adult human small intestinal myenteric Hu<sup>+</sup> cells show evidence of mitosis and hence are cycling neuroblasts. We observe that proportions of Hu<sup>+</sup> cycling neuroblasts in the adult murine ENS neither vary with ganglionic size nor do they differ significantly between two intestinal regions, duodenum and ileum, or between sexes. Confocal microscopy provides further evidence of cytokinesis in Hu<sup>+</sup> cells. The presence of a significant population of cycling neuroblasts in adult ENS provides further evidence of steady-state neurogenesis in the adult ENS.</p>

                <p>Motor skill learning enables organisms to interact effectively with their environment, relying on neural mechanisms that integrate sensory feedback with motor output. While sensory feedback, such as auditory cues linked to motor actions, enhances motor performance in humans, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Developing a reliable animal model of augmented motor skill learning is crucial to begin dissecting the biological systems that underpin this enhancement. We hypothesized that continuous auditory feedback during a motor task would promote complex motor skill acquisition in mice. We developed a closed-loop system using DeepLabCut for real-time markerless tracking of mouse forepaw movements with high processing speed and low latency. By encoding forepaw movements into auditory tones of different frequencies, mice received continuous auditory feedback during a reaching task requiring vertical displacement of the left forepaw to a target. Adult mice were trained over 4&nbsp;d with either auditory feedback or no feedback. Mice receiving auditory feedback exhibited significantly enhanced motor skill learning compared with controls. Clustering analysis of reaching trajectories showed that auditory feedback mice established consistent reaching trajectories by Day 2 of motor training. These findings demonstrate that real-time, movement-coded auditory feedback effectively promotes motor skill learning in mice. This closed-loop system, leveraging advanced machine learning and real-time tracking, offers new avenues for exploring motor control mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies for motor disorders through augmented sensory feedback.</p>

                <p>How humans achieve such a high degree of prosocial behavior is a subject of considerable interest. Exploration of the neural foundations of human prosociality has garnered significant attention in recent decades. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying human prosociality remain to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed multimodal brain imaging data and data from 15 economic games. The results revealed several significant associations between brain characteristics and prosocial behavior, including stronger interhemispheric connectivity and larger corpus callosum volume. Greater functional segregation and integration, alongside fewer myelin maps combined with a thicker cortex, were linked to prosocial behavior, particularly within the social brain regions. The current study demonstrates that these metrics serve as brain markers of human prosocial behavior and provides novel insights into the structural and functional brain basis of human prosocial behavior.</p>

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, ranking 4th in men and 2nd in women. While once rare in Asian countries, the incidence of CRC has increased in these populations, likely due to risk factors such as a Western diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyles, and aging. In Indonesia, early-onset CRC (EOCRC) has risen alarmingly, with a previous study reporting an annual percentage change of 1.98% from 2009 to 2019. Several studies have linked EOCRC with Microsatellite Instability (MSI), which is gaining attention for its role in CRC diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to explore MSI status in Indonesian CRC patients to better understand its role in the rise of EOCRC and its potential in CRC screening. Methods Fixed formalin paraffin-embedded samples and corresponding clinical data were retrieved from 100 patients diagnosed with CRC between 2018 and 2020. DNA extraction was performed on the samples, and subsequent analysis utilized the N_lynch panel, real-time PCR, and HRM analysis. MSI status was determined based on the presence of two positive markers. Results As much as 12.4% of our subjects were MSI-H and 34% of the subjects were early onset cases. There is a significant difference of tumor location between MSI-H and MSS, in which larger percentage of MSI-H tumor was right-sided (33.3%) than left-sided (9.7%). No significant difference was found in terms of gender, age, onset, stage, and performance status. No significant difference between gender, tumor location, stage, MSI status, and performance status between early onset and late onset group. Conclusion There is a high rate of early onset CRC in Indonesia that is not caused by MSI but rather, possibly, by an undiscovered factor. Further study is needed to explore novel pathway that could explain this phenomenon.

                Introduction People with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) suffer from a number of motor and non-motor disorders. Research in the field of motor learning suggests the superiority of an external focus of attention (EFA) compared to an internal focus of attention (IFA), including for PwPD. However, no systematic review with meta-analysis has yet examined the effectiveness of different attentional foci across medication states (ON & OFF) for this population. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an EFA versus an IFA on balance, gait, and motor symptom severity in PwPD during both medication states. Methods The study design was a systematic review with meta-analysis. Four electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. Methodological quality was assessed with the PEDro scale. Results Nine studies with a total of 240 subjects were used for the analyses. The meta-analysis for the ON/normal medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI between -0.46 and 0.46), gait (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI between - 0.30 and 0.53), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.16; 95% CI between -0.55 and 0.22). The meta-analysis for the OFF medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.15; 95% CI between -0.24 and 0.54), gait (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI between -0.56 and 0.88), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.15; 95% CI between -0.53 and 0.24). Conclusion Neither attentional focus showed a significant benefit over the other for balance, gait, or motor symptom severity in PwPD regardless of medication state. In the absence of a group effect, the choice of attentional focus may be determined by a person-cantered approach, considering aspects such as individual preferences, training duration, and medication. The results of this work should only be interpreted considering the risk of bias.

                Introduction Perforation of mature ovarian teratomas is rare. This revelation may be misleading. We report a unique case of a ruptured teratoma mimicking an appendicular abscess, emphasizing the value of sharing such an experience to learn from our mistakes as well as the importance of a conservative approach in the treatment of these tumors in children. Case description A 12-year-old-girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-days history of worsening abdominal pain. She reported a fever associated with vomiting and diarrhea. On physical examination, the patient was feverish and displayed generalized tenderness, especially in the right iliac fossa where there was a palpable mass. white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were significantly elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed appendicular abscess. Intraoperatively, a perforated right ovarian teratoma was found, and ovarian sparing surgery was performed. No postoperative complications were noted, and histology confirmed the diagnosis of a mature teratoma. Conclusion The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in girls is broad and includes gynecological disorders. Ovarian teratomas can progress silently. In this case, the diagnosis can be made intraoperatively when a complication has occurred. Surgeons and radiologists are not always able to establish a positive diagnosis when there are no obvious clinicoradiological features. Even when the diagnosis is made intraoperatively, treatment must be appropriate and conservative surgery remains a therapeutic option.

                Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are a well-known complication of vascular access procedures and account for the majority of pseudoaneurysm presentations. To mitigate open surgical risk, the current mainstays of endovascular treatment include direct percutaneous thrombin injection or selective embolization or stenting which are contingent on favourable pseudoaneurysm characteristics. We present a case of a comorbid 91-year-old woman with a large refractory iatrogenic superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck following elective coronary angiography with successful vascular closure device-assisted repair following attempted direct thrombin injection. This case presents a novel technique for the endovascular repair of refractory femoral pseudoaneurysms in patients on anticoagulation and at high risk for open surgical repair.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background Bangladesh is an emerging country where teachers and students of public and private universities have started using technology in the classrooms. Many teachers and students of social science faculty have an inclination to use ChatGPT for educational and research purposes. By focusing on this specific context, the study aims to bring insights into the perception and integration of ChatGPT into the educational practices in an emerging country. Methods This study employed a mixed method approach. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaire survey from 402 teachers and 440 students of eight different public and private universities following a stratified sampling approach. A convenience sampling technique was followed with a view to collecting qualitative data through in-depth interviews of 32 participants, including 16 teachers and 16 students from both public and private universities. Results The research presents that students and teachers both have proficiency, but there is a gap in expertise. Students perceive ChatGPT as beneficial for better learning outcomes, and teachers find it helpful in preparing for classes and instructional materials. Both teachers and students consider ChatGPT requirng minimal effort. Though students are influenced by their peers to use it, teachers are not. On the other hand, teachers have more behavioral intentions to use it in the future than the students have. Yet worries over ethical use, reliance, and information accuracy prevail. High cost and language barriers are also listed as reasons for level of accessibility . Conclusion The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of policies, research endeavors, and teaching-learning practices in the higher education sector covering both public and private universities in Bangladesh and similar contexts.

                Background Transitioning from national service to mainstream employment can be daunting, especially in this era of high unemployment in Ghana. Most universities found the need to incorporate entrepreneurship education into their curriculum hoping to get graduates to take up entrepreneurship activities instead of being employed by someone else. This study investigated Ghanaian tertiary-level graduates’ education and work intentions as they work through their mandatory national service program. Methods Graduates from across Ghana’s tertiary institutions were sampled (n=1011; males=73%, females=27%) from various tertiary institutions via the National Service Scheme website. An online questionnaire with questions on work and postgraduate study intentions, perceptions of tertiary education received, and whether they would like to start their own business or expect to be employed was filled out. Results The results revealed that despite calls for graduates to venture into self-employment, graduates still had hopes for formal sector employment (64%) and fewer had entrepreneurship intentions (8%). Entrepreneurship intentions were significantly related to gender as more males than females had intentions of starting their own businesses regardless of having taken entrepreneurship courses. Graduates expressed satisfaction (83%) with their tertiary education however called for additional services like attachment opportunities and internship positions within industry. Conclusions The study concludes that though the graduates were satisfied with their education, yet they wished they had received more practical hands-on training in addition, and more career and job fairs, however, none of these desires were to help them set themselves up but rather to help them to be employed by someone. The study recommendations reiterate calls for enhanced industry-educational institutions’ collaboration to provide graduates with more industry-specific skills and ease the transition to labour market. Intensify entrepreneurship learning opportunities but also at the national level address barriers to successful entrepreneurship including access to low-interest rate funding and favourable policies and infrastructure.

                <p>by Yifan Yao, Scott Pauls, Duncan Foley, Tomoko Yoshikawa, Sato Honma, Ken-Ichi Honma, Ellie McVeigh, Nicolas C. Foley, Rae Silver</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locus of a circadian clock, is a small nucleus of approximately 20,000 neurons that oscillate with a period of about 24 hours. While individual neurons produce circadian oscillations even when dispersed in culture, the coherence and robustness of oscillation of the SCN as a whole is dependent on its circuitry. Surprisingly, the individual neurons of the intact SCN do not all oscillate in phase with each other. To understand the oscillatory dynamics across the intact nucleus, we develop a model of the relation of the phase of neurons to their PER2 expression at a particular subjective time (CT1900) using <i>time series data</i> from SCN slice preparations. Next, we use the model, which produces a surprisingly good fit in the SCN slice data, to estimate oscillator phase at a single time point (CT1900) in <i>snapshot</i> data from PER2 expression measurements in intact, unsliced SCN-wide tissue. To monitor temporal changes in phase in time series data, we use PER2::LUC imaging in an ex vivo SCN slice preparation. To study phase in the intact SCN at a fixed time point we use data generated by PER2 staining and a tissue clearing protocol. Because PER2 expression, as measured in the time series slices and the snapshot intact SCN are not directly comparable, the model estimated from time series slices to the snapshot intact SCN data requires a calibrating constant. The results indicate that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the SCN slice data and is therefore a meaningful method for estimating phase in the intact SCN snapshot data, permitting the study of virtual interventions such as virtual tissue slicing. We next compare oscillation in circuits in the SCN-wide tissue to those that have been disrupted by virtual slicing using a Kuramoto model to simulate the dynamics. The results support prior evidence that the damage done by coronal slicing has the most disruptive impact on SCN oscillation, while horizontal slicing has the least damage. The results point to the importance of connectivity along the caudal-to-rostral axis and indicate that SCN circuit organization depends on the caudal-to-rostral flow of information. In summary, the construction of this model is a major finding of the paper. Our modeling allows us to perform the previously impossible analysis of oscillatory dynamics in static data in an intact SCN captured at a single time point.

                Background The neoliberal approach to higher education management has significantly transformed collegiality and university governance. This study identifies and analyzes how and where these changes have occurred, as well as their impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of universities. It addresses existing research gaps and provides new insights for adaptation strategies. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY (“collegiality”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“change management”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“neolibelism”)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“higher education”). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.

                Nakazawa et al. show that the cerebellar granule cell is equipped with multiple actomyosin engines to migrate in the heterogeneous microenvironment of developing brain tissue. In a 3D confined environment, PIEZO1 induces the translocation of actomyosin to the posterior membrane through PKC-ezrin signaling and generates pushing force in the migrating neuron.

This stability of the PM not only prevents overactivation of the Imd pathway but also maintains the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells.

                Xu et al. show that IL6, not TNF-α, suppresses mitochondrial function. When PGC1 is low, IL6 increases HIF1A transcription and stabilizes HIF1α protein via ERRα. HIF1α reciprocally suppresses ERRα, contributing to the mitochondrial suppression. Overexpression of PGC1 rescues ERRα from being sequestered by HIF1α, thereby boosting mitochondrial function.

                Mergan et al. conducted an fMRI-guided electrophysiology study in macaque prefrontal face patches. They found that, although receptive fields and basic selectivity in these face patches resemble those in ITC, a subset of POC neurons show rapid face responses (30 ms). These may enable fast top-down facilitation in face processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103259">Maf-family bZIP transcription factor NRL interacts with RNA-binding proteins and R-loops in retinal photoreceptors</a></h4>

              
                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) perform diverse functions including the regulation of chromatin dynamics and the coupling of transcription with RNA processing. However, our understanding of their actions in mammalian neurons remains limited. Using affinity purification, yeast-two-hybrid and proximity ligation assays, we identified interactions of multiple RBPs with neural retina leucine (NRL) zipper, a Maf-family transcription factor critical for retinal rod photoreceptor development and function. In addition to splicing, many NRL-interacting RBPs are associated with R-loops, which form during transcription and increase during photoreceptor maturation. Focusing on DHX9 RNA helicase, we demonstrate that its expression is modulated by NRL and that the NRL–DHX9 interaction is positively influenced by R-loops. ssDRIP-Seq analysis reveals both stranded and unstranded R-loops at distinct genomic elements, characterized by active and inactive epigenetic signatures and enriched at neuronal genes. NRL binds to both types of R-loops, suggesting an epigenetically independent function. Our findings suggest additional functions of NRL during transcription and highlight complex interactions among transcription factors, RBPs, and R-loops in regulating photoreceptor gene expression in the mammalian retina.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97649">Impaired yolk sac NAD metabolism disrupts murine embryogenesis with relevance to human birth defects</a></h4>

              
                Congenital malformations can originate from numerous genetic or non-genetic factors but in most cases the causes are unknown. Genetic disruption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo synthesis causes multiple malformations, collectively termed Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), highlighting the necessity of this pathway during embryogenesis. Previous work in mice shows that NAD deficiency perturbs embryonic development specifically when organs are forming. While the pathway is predominantly active in the liver postnatally, the site of activity prior to and during organogenesis is unknown. Here, we used a mouse model of human CNDD and assessed pathway functionality in embryonic livers and extraembryonic tissues via gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolic analyses. We found that the extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac endoderm exclusively synthesises NAD de novo during early organogenesis before the embryonic liver takes over this function. Under CNDD-inducing conditions, visceral yolk sacs had reduced NAD levels and altered NAD-related metabolic profiles, affecting embryo metabolism. Expression of requisite pathway genes is conserved in the equivalent yolk sac cell type in humans. Our findings show that visceral yolk sac-mediated NAD de novo synthesis activity is essential for mouse embryogenesis and its perturbation causes CNDD. As mouse and human yolk sacs are functionally homologous, our data improve the understanding of human congenital malformation causation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97021">Regulation of lung cancer initiation and progression by the stem cell determinant Musashi</a></h4>

              
                Despite advances in therapeutic approaches, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. To understand the molecular programs underlying lung cancer initiation and maintenance, we focused on stem cell programs that are normally extinguished with differentiation but can be reactivated during oncogenesis. Here, we have used extensive genetic modeling and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to identify a dual role for Msi2: as a signal that acts initially to sensitize cells to transformation, and subsequently to drive tumor propagation. Using Msi reporter mice, we found that Msi2-expressing cells were marked by a pro-oncogenic landscape and a preferential ability to respond to Ras and p53 mutations. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of <i>Msi2</i> in an autochthonous Ras/p53-driven lung cancer model resulted in a marked reduction of tumor burden, delayed progression, and a doubling of median survival. Additionally, this dependency was conserved in human disease as inhibition of Msi2 impaired tumor growth in PDXs. Mechanistically, Msi2 triggered a broad range of pathways critical for tumor growth, including several novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal a critical role for Msi2 in aggressive lung adenocarcinoma, lend new insight into the biology of this disease, and identify potential new therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97261">On the role of VP3-PI3P interaction in birnavirus endosomal membrane targeting</a></h4>

              
                Birnaviruses are a group of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses infecting birds, fish, and insects. Early endosomes (EE) constitute the platform for viral replication. Here, we study the mechanism of birnaviral targeting of EE membranes. Using the Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) as a model, we validate that the viral protein 3 (VP3) binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) present in EE membranes. We identify the domain of VP3 involved in PI3P-binding, named P2 and localized in the core of VP3, and establish the critical role of the arginine at position 200 (R<sub>200</sub>), conserved among all known birnaviruses. Mutating R<sub>200</sub> abolishes viral replication. Moreover, we propose a two-stage modular mechanism for VP3 association with EE. Firstly, the carboxy-terminal region of VP3 adsorbs on the membrane, and then the VP3 core reinforces the membrane engagement by specifically binding PI3P through its P2 domain, additionally promoting PI3P accumulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104432">Evaluation of information flows in the RAS-MAPK system using transfer entropy measurements</a></h4>

              
                The RAS-MAPK system plays an important role in regulating various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation. Dysregulation of this system has been implicated in genetic diseases and cancers affecting diverse tissues. To better understand the regulation of this system, we employed information flow analysis based on transfer entropy (TE) between the activation dynamics of two key elements in cells stimulated with EGF: SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchanger for the small GTPase RAS, and RAF, a RAS effector serine/threonine kinase. TE analysis allows for model-free assessment of the timing, direction, and strength of the information flow regulating the system response. We detected significant amounts of TE in both directions between SOS and RAF, indicating feedback regulation. Importantly, the amount of TE did not simply follow the input dose or the intensity of the causal reaction, demonstrating the uniqueness of TE. TE analysis proposed regulatory networks containing multiple tracks and feedback loops and revealed temporal switching in the reaction pathway primarily responsible for reaction control. This proposal was confirmed by the effects of an MEK inhibitor on TE. Furthermore, TE analysis identified the functional disorder of a SOS mutation associated with Noonan syndrome<b>,</b> a human genetic disease, of which the pathogenic mechanism has not been precisely known yet. TE assessment holds significant promise as a model-free analysis method of reaction networks in molecular pharmacology and pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102151">Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling regulates the ability of Müller glia to become neurogenic, proliferating progenitor-like cells</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of these studies is to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, dedifferentiation of Müller glia (MG), reprogramming into proliferating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), and neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs in the chick retina. We found that S1P-related genes are highly expressed by retinal neurons and glia, and levels of expression were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. Drug treatments that activate S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) or increase levels of S1P suppressed the formation of MGPCs. Conversely, treatments that inhibit S1PR1 or decrease levels of S1P stimulated the formation of MGPCs. Inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis significantly enhanced the neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs. We report that S1P-related gene expression in MG is modulated by microglia and inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis partially rescues the loss of MGPC formation in damaged retinas missing microglia. Finally, we show that TGFβ/Smad3 signaling in the resting retina maintains S1PR1 expression in MG. We conclude that the S1P signaling is dynamically regulated in MG and MGPCs in the chick retina, and activation of S1P signaling depends, in part, on signals produced by reactive microglia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92119">Movies reveal the fine-grained organization of infant visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Studying infant minds with movies is a promising way to increase engagement relative to traditional tasks. However, the spatial specificity and functional significance of movie-evoked activity in infants remains unclear. Here, we investigated what movies can reveal about the organization of the infant visual system. We collected fMRI data from 15 awake infants and toddlers aged 5–23 months who attentively watched a movie. The activity evoked by the movie reflected the functional profile of visual areas. Namely, homotopic areas from the two hemispheres responded similarly to the movie, whereas distinct areas responded dissimilarly, especially across dorsal and ventral visual cortex. Moreover, visual maps that typically require time-intensive and complicated retinotopic mapping could be predicted, albeit imprecisely, from movie-evoked activity in both data-driven analyses (i.e. independent component analysis) at the individual level and by using functional alignment into a common low-dimensional embedding to generalize across participants. These results suggest that the infant visual system is already structured to process dynamic, naturalistic information and that fine-grained cortical organization can be discovered from movie data.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90826">The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus facilitates hippocampo-cortical dialogue during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation during sleep depends on the interregional coupling of slow waves, spindles, and sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), across the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus, linking the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus, may facilitate interregional coupling during sleep. To test this hypothesis, we used intracellular, extracellular unit and local field potential recordings in anesthetized and head restrained non-anesthetized cats as well as computational modelling. Electrical stimulation of the reuniens evoked both antidromic and orthodromic intracellular mPFC responses, consistent with bidirectional functional connectivity between mPFC, reuniens and hippocampus in anesthetized state. The major finding obtained from behaving animals is that at least during NREM sleep hippocampo-reuniens-mPFC form a functional loop. SWRs facilitate the triggering of thalamic spindles, which later reach neocortex. In return, transition to mPFC UP states increase the probability of hippocampal SWRs and later modulate spindle amplitude. During REM sleep hippocampal theta activity provides periodic locking of reuniens neuronal firing and strong crosscorrelation at LFP level, but the values of reuniens-mPFC crosscorrelation was relatively low and theta power at mPFC was low. The neural mass model of this network demonstrates that the strength of bidirectional hippocampo-thalamic connections determines the coupling of oscillations, suggesting a mechanistic link between synaptic weights and the propensity for interregional synchrony. Our results demonstrate the presence of functional connectivity in hippocampo-thalamo-cortical network, but the efficacy of this connectivity is modulated by behavioral state.

">Motor control processes moderate visual working memory gating</a></h4>

              
                Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (OSF), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.

">Frontal connectivity dynamics encode contextual information during action preparation</a></h4>

              
                The context in which we perform motor acts shapes our behavior, with movement speed and accuracy modulated by contingent factors, such as the occurrence of cues that trigger or inhibit our actions. This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.

">How and when can environmental influences change cerebral cortex? An experimental training study of twins with birth weight differences</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical morphology is genetically programmed but also influenced by environment both in development and adulthood. Determining the timing of these influences across the lifespan is a key challenge. Here we test what makes genetically identical brains differ and converge. Mono- (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 206, age 16-79 yrs) with known extent of birth weight (BW) discordance, had MRIs pre- and post- 10 weeks immersive virtual reality navigation training in a train-rest-rest/rest-train-rest-design, or as passive controls. As a measure of between-twin similarity, we calculated "brainprints" from 272 structural cortical features, to assess effects of genetic (MZ/DZ) and environmental variation at early (BW discordance) and later life stages (training status). Baseline brainprint similarity was higher in MZ than DZ twins, but greater BW discordance yielded less similarity in MZ (r = -.54, p < .0001), dominated by cortical area effects (t = -6.748, p < .0001). In contrast, training increased brainprint similarity of MZ relative to DZ twins (zygosity x training; t = -2.864, p =.0046), mostly by cortical curvature (t = -4.401, p<.0001). Follow-up analyses indicated training increased white matter curvature and surface area. The findings demonstrate that in adulthood, early life environmental difference persistently contributes to make the brains of genetically identical twins deviate, while concurrent environmental influence in the form of training still can cause their brainprints to converge at the grey-white-matter boundary. This indicates how these early and later environmental influences on the cortex can be distinguished, and how cortical characteristics can be modified.

">Cerebellar involvement in self-timing</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is well-established in sub-second motor timing, but its role in supra-second interval timing remains unclear. Here, we investigate how cerebellar output influences time estimation over longer timescales. Rats performed an interval timing task, estimating time based on an auditory cue, while chemogenetic inhibition of the lateral cerebellar nucleus assessed its role in both predictable (externally cued) and unpredictable (internally cued) timing conditions. Cerebellar inhibition produced bidirectional effects: delayed action initiation in predictable trials and premature responses in unpredictable trials. Despite slowed movement, overall task success rates remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment in temporal estimation rather than motor execution. These findings demonstrate that the cerebellum integrates motor and cognitive processes for supra-second timing, with differential effects on externally guided and self-generated timing. Our results provide evidence that the lateral cerebellum contributes to supra-second interval timing, supporting its role in adaptive behavior across extended timescales.

                A mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment requires us to follow the multiscale processes that connect molecular genetic processes to macroscopic cerebral cortical formations and thence to neurological function. Using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of the ferret, a model organism for studying cortical morphogenesis, we create in vitro physical gel models and in silico numerical simulations of normal brain gyrification. Using observations of genetically manipulated animal models, we identify cerebral cortical thickness and cortical expansion rate as the primary drivers of dysmorphogenesis and demonstrate that in silico models allow us to examine the causes of aberrations in morphology and developmental processes at various stages of cortical ontogenesis. Finally, we explain analogous cortical malformations in human brains, with comparisons with human phenotypes induced by the same genetic defects, providing a unified perspective on brain morphogenesis that is driven proximally by genetic causes and affected mechanically via variations in the geometry of the brain and differential growth of the cortex.

">Patchy Striatonigral Neurons Modulate Locomotor Vigor in Response to Environmental Valence</a></h4>

              
                Spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsal striatum play crucial roles in locomotion control and value-based decision-making. SPNs, which include both direct-pathway striatonigral and indirect-pathway striatopallidal neurons, can be further classified into subtypes based on distinct transcriptomic profiles and cell body distribution patterns. However, how these SPN subtypes regulate spontaneous locomotion in the context of environmental valence remains unclear. Using Sepw1-Cre transgenic mice, which label a specific SPN subtype characterized by a patchy distribution of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum, we found that these patchy striatonigral neurons constrain motor vigor in response to valence differentials. In a modified light/dark box test, mice exhibited differential walking speeds between the light and dark zones. Genetic ablation of these patchy SPNs disrupted restful slowing in the dark zone and increased transition frequencies between zones. In vivo recordings linked the activity of these neurons to zone occupancy, speed, and deceleration, with a specific role in mediating deceleration. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of patchy SPNs-and optical activation of striatonigral neurons in particular-reduced locomotion and attenuated speed-based zone discrimination. These findings reveal that a subtype of patchy striatonigral neurons regulates implicit walking speed selection based on innate valence differentials.

">The P50 predicts conscious perception under tactile but not electrical somatosensory stimulation in human EEG</a></h4>

              
                Past research has not reached consensus about the neural correlates of conscious somatosensory perception. Different studies have identified ERP components at various latencies as predictors of somatosensory detection, but it is still largely unclear which factors are responsible for this variation. Here, for the first time we directly compare the event-related potential correlates of stimulus detection under tactile versus electrical peri-threshold stimulation in a between-groups design, while controlling for task-relevance and post-perceptual processes with a visual-somatosensory matching task. We show that the P50 component predicts conscious perception under tactile, but not electrical stimulation: while electrical stimulation evokes a P50 already for subliminal stimuli, there is no subliminal P50 for tactile stimulation. In contrast, the P100 and N140 components robustly predict conscious detection in both stimulation groups. Tactile stimulation produced a clearly separable N80 component for detected stimuli, that appeared as part of the N140 under electrical stimulation. The P300 predicted conscious detection even though we controlled for post-perceptual processes, suggesting that it partly reflects aspects of subjective experience. Our results demonstrate that the neural correlates of somatosensory detection depend on the type of stimulation used, limiting the scope of previous results achieved using electrical stimulation.

                Leptomeningeal collaterals are distal pial arterial anastomotic vessels that provide an alternative route for 29 redistributing cerebral blood flow following arterial obstruction, thereby limiting tissue damage. However, 30 the regulatory mechanisms and strategies to enhance this adaptive response remain under investigation. 31 This study explored the pharmacological effects of Tie2 receptor activation, using the peptide agonist 32 Vasculotide, following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Vasculotide improved 33 collateral growth and remodeling, which correlated with reduced infarct volume, enhanced blood flow, and 34 functional recovery within 24hrs post-pMCAO. In contrast, collateral growth was attenuated in Tie2 and 35 EphA4/Tie2 double knockdown mice, while the loss of EphA4 increased Tie2 and Ang-1 expression and 36 mimicked the positive effects of Vasculotide following stroke. Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing of 37 meningeal tissue identified key transcriptomic changes, including alterations in AJ-associated transcripts, 38 such as Krt5, Krt14, and Col17a1, in the ipsilateral meninges of both endothelial cell-specific EphA4 39 knockout and Vasculotide-treated mice. Krt5 expression was found upregulated on meningeal arterial 40 vascular network in injured KO mice, highlighting a potential new mediator of meningeal vascular 41 remodeling. These findings illustrate that EphA4 and Tie2 play opposing roles in collateral remodeling, 42 including the regulation of Krt5. Modulating their activity could potentially enhance the collateral response 43 to stroke.

                Background: Neuronal exocytosis is mainly driven by the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. However, little is known about the organization principle of the SNARE complex. Methods: Protein condensates formed by SNARE complex were imaged by confocal microscope. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay together with fusion and division assays at the cellular level and in vitro studies with purified proteins were performed to characterize the dynamic properties of protein condensates. The effect of SNARE complex phase separation on the recruitment of synaptic vesicles was detected by immunofluorescence. Results: We discover that phase separation drives SNARE complex formation and aggregation; in addition, nonintrinsically disordered regions (non-IDRs) of the syntaxin1 protein is necessary for the formation of these biological condensates. Functionally, phase separation of the SNARE complex can be regulated by the major cofactors of the fusion machinery and has the ability to recruit synaptic vesicles in neurons. Conclusions: Our study here establishes that phase separation is a promising way to mediate the formation and aggregation of the SNARE complex, and further identified that the non-IDRs of syntaxin1 is necessary for the phase separation of the SNARE complex. Our work answers an vital scientific question: does the SNARE complex function as multiple copies that are dispersed or clustered together to ensure sustained neurotransmitter release. In sum, phase separation provides an ideal working model for SNARE complex-mediated membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release.

">Peripheral Beta-Blockade Differentially Enhances Cardiac and Respiratory Interoception</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the perception of internal visceral states, arises from complex brain-body interactions across the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite noradrenaline's key role in these interactions, its specific contribution to interoceptive processes remains unclear. In a placebo-controlled, randomised, within-subject study, we employed computational modelling of interoceptive psychophysics to determine how pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor antagonism controls interoception across cardiac and respiratory domains. Both cardio-selective bisoprolol and non-selective propranolol improved cardiac perceptual sensitivity, with bisoprolol exerting an enhanced effect on cardiac metacognition. In contrast, both beta-blockers increased respiratory perceptual precision, with no corresponding changes in sensitivity or metacognition. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between central and peripheral beta-adrenergic mechanisms in interoception, highlighting the pivotal role of peripheral noradrenaline in regulating multi-organ brain-body interactions. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may provide promising routes for modulating distinct facets of interoception, potentially opening new avenues for intervention in conditions characterised by disrupted bodily self-awareness.

">Parabrachial Calca neurons influence aversive and appetitive taste function</a></h4>

              
                The parabrachial (PB) nucleus participates in taste processing and integration with other senses. PB neurons that express the Calca gene support sensory-integrative responses, albeit only limited data have addressed their influence on taste. Here we studied how chemogenetic dampening of PB-Calca neurons impacted mouse orosensory preferences for diverse taste stimuli in brief-access fluid exposure tests, which capture oral sensory/tongue control of licking behavior. Intracranial delivery of Cre-dependent viruses in female and male CalcaCre/+ mice induced expression of the inhibitory designer receptor hM4Di:mCherry (hM4Di mice) or fluorophore mCherry alone (mCherry mice) in PB-Calca neurons. Several weeks later, hM4Di and mCherry mice entered brief-access tests where they could lick taste solutions on discrete seconds-long trials. Stimuli included the behaviorally avoided, but functionally different, bitter taste stimuli quinine (0 [water], 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mM) and cycloheximide (0, 0.001, 0.003, and 0.01 mM), and the appetitive sugar sucrose (0, 100, 300, 500, and 1000 mM). Both hM4Di and mCherry mice received the hM4Di ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to daily tests performed by blinded experimenters. With CNO, hM4Di mice displayed greater average licking (i.e., less avoidance) of quinine (p < 0.05), but not cycloheximide (p > 0.3), than mCherry mice, implying PB-Calca neurons variably influence orosensory responses across bitter stimuli. Moreover, male hM4Di mice selectively showed reduced mean licking preferences for sucrose under CNO (p < 0.05). These data suggest that PB-Calca neurons participate in both aversive and appetitive taste-guided behaviors, with their role in appetitive taste dependent on sex.

">C9orf72-ALS mutation drives mitophagy impairments in iNeurons</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive upper and lower motor neuron loss. A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene is the most common mutation found in populations of European descent. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in C9orf72-ALS patients and models of the disease, however reports on mitochondrial clearance via mitophagy in C9orf72-ALS are limited. Results: iNeurons from C9orf72-ALS patients displayed reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitophagy, due to reductions in autophagosome production and reduced ULK1 recruitment to mitochondria. No consistent changes to PINK1/Parkin or BNIP3 mitophagy pathways were observed. Conclusions: Our data show that mitochondrial function is impaired in C9orf72-ALS patient iNeurons. An in-depth characterisation of mitophagy suggests that a deficit in autophagosome production is responsible and provides further evidence that toxic gain-of-function mechanisms in C9orf72-ALS are responsible for autophagy deficits.

">Amyloid beta is released by lysosomal exocytosis from hiPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                The endosomal-lysosomal system has long been linked to the production of amyloid beta (A{beta}), but the specific intracellular compartments involved in A{beta} secretion remain contentious. While lysosomes are typically associated with A{beta} degradation, studies have also shown that lysosomes also serve as site of A{beta} accumulation in cells, mouse models, and human tissues. Lysosomal exocytosis is a major secretory pathway in non-neuronal cells, but few studies have investigated this pathway in neurons. Here, we examined the potential role and mechanism of lysosomal exocytosis in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, and we hypothesized that lysosomal exocytosis is a pathway for A{beta} secretion from these neurons. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, lysosomes filled with fluorescently labelled amyloid were seen approaching and fusing with the plasma membrane in real-time. The number and composition of the released particles were characterized using nanoscale flow cytometry. Silencing two proteins, Rab27b and munc13-4, significantly reduced these events and blocked the release of amyloid into the extracellular space. Our results provide direct evidence for the involvement of lysosomal exocytosis in the release of A{beta} from neurons and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

">Heterogeneous monotonic and non-monotonic responses to odor in mitral/tufted glomeruli of the mouse olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Current models of olfactory sensory processing in the olfactory bulb (OB) posit that both intra- and interglomerular inhibitory circuits are involved in transforming sensory input. However, the impact of these circuits on different olfactory receptor neuron (ORNs) inputs remains poorly understood. We generated a model of the OB input-output transformation in which the output of each glomerulus is a function of its ORN input, local feed-forward intraglomerular inhibition and interglomerular normalization in which activity of each glomerulus is divided by the population response. The output of the model included linear and non-linear concentration-response relationships that depended on the input ORN Hill coefficient and half-activation value. The concentration-response relationships could be broadly categorized into four groups based on how the output response was influenced by increasing the concentration. Increasing concentration evoked monotonic increases (I) or decreases (D) in some glomeruli. Other glomeruli responded with non-monotonic decreases then increases (DI) or increased then decreased (ID). The non-monotonic ID glomeruli required interglomerular inhibition in our model, were most common in glomeruli with higher affinity ORN input and were heterogeneous in the magnitude of their drop. In vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from MTC glomeruli in awake mice revealed qualitatively similar response types. Increasing levels of excitation drove higher levels of suppression in subsets of glomeruli, and nearly half of the recorded MTC glomeruli could be classified as ID. Additionally, the sensitivity of individual glomeruli was significantly correlated with the degree to which it was non-monotonic. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear responses of MTC to changes in odor concentration are not unusual, but indeed are typical, and that they can be explained by intra- and interglomerular inhibition.

">Common but different: An ERP study of single- and multi-source interference processing in MSIT</a></h4>

              
                Flexible behavior often requires processing of complex, interfering information. Research has investigated conflict-related brain processes mostly using single tasks which hindered direct comparison of different interference types. Thus, the question if they are resolved by a common mechanism or by a set of different, task-specific mechanisms remains open. In this study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of cognitive control across Simon, flanker, multi-source and no-conflict conditions. Our findings reveal that all trial types engaged the same sequence of processing stages, as indicated by common ERP waveforms and consistent number and order of microstates across conditions. However, the intensity and duration of these common stages scaled with difficulty of the conflict task (as measured by RTs and accuracy) from Simon to flanker to multi-source interference. Flanker conflict uniquely influenced early ERP components strongly engaging the dorsal attentional system and visual areas, likely due to demands posed by the presence of flanker distractors. Later ERP components (with sources including ventral attention and somatomotor network areas) were affected by both conflicts. Accordingly, when flanker and Simon conflicts were presented together, early processes lineary summed up, but there was an interaction at the later stage of processing paralleling nonlinear drop of accuracy in a multi-conflict condition. Our study provides novel insights into the neural dynamics underlying cognitive control engaged across different conflict types and their interaction. The use of source analysis allowed us to ground ERP-based findings in the wider context of studies, including those using neuroimaging techniques.

">Temporal attention and oculomotor effects dissociate distinct types of temporal expectation</a></h4>

              
                Temporal expectation-the ability to predict when events occur-relies on probabilistic information within the environment. Two types of temporal expectation, temporal precision, based on the variability of an event's onset, and hazard rate, based on the increasing probability of an event with onset delay, interact with temporal attention-ability to prioritize specific moments- at the performance level: Attentional benefits increase with precision but diminish with hazard rate. Both temporal expectation and temporal attention improve fixational stability; however, the distinct oculomotor effects of temporal precision and hazard rate, as well as their interactions with temporal attention, remain unknown. Investigating microsaccade dynamics, we found that hazard-based expectations were reflected in the oculomotor responses, whereas precision- based expectations emerged only when temporal attention was deployed. We also found perception-eye movement dissociations for both types of temporal expectation, yet attentional benefits in performance coincided with microsaccade rate modulations. These findings reveal an interplay among distinct types of temporal expectation and temporal attention in enhancing and recalibrating fixational stability.

	<p>Background: Schizotypal traits are notably prevalent among children diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both conditions commonly exhibit impairments in executive functions (EF), which encompass cool and hot processes. The observed deficits in these EF domains across ASD and schizotypy underscore a compelling need to investigate how their co-occurrence impacts EF. Methods: This study investigated the impact of co-occurring autistic and schizotypal traits on EF in 63 children diagnosed with ASD, aged 7 to 12 years. Participants were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2), the Melbourne Assessment of Schizotypy in Kids (MASK), and a battery of hot and cool EF tests. Results: Correlational analyses revealed a significant association between MASK score and working memory, as well as between ADOS scores and various cool EF components (i.e., working memory, inhibition and planning). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the interaction between ADOS and MASK scores significantly predicted performance on hot EF (i.e., affective decision-making), but not on cool EF tasks. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the co-occurrence of ASD and schizotypal traits may have differential effects on cool and hot EF domains. Understanding how the combination of autistic and schizotypal traits affects cognitive processes may inform tailored interventions and support strategies for individuals presenting with these traits.</p>

	<p>Knowledge about sleep was very limited at the time when Freud published his seminal work on the interpretation of dreams. He was also not interested in sleep, which was considered a problem of physiology; however, sleep appears to have a central role in his model, since dreaming is considered the guardian of sleep. The function of dreaming, according to Freud, is to protect sleep from disruption, with the dream working to avoid repressed stimuli interrupting the &amp;amp;ldquo;biological&amp;amp;rdquo; function of sleep. Before neurophysiological studies provided evidence that sleep is not a passive state, Freud also recognized sleep as an active process, as human beings voluntarily withdraw their attention from the external world to actively move to sleep. The discovery of REM sleep in the 1950s led psychoanalysts to see sleep as the necessary background to the occurrence of dreaming. Although Freud dismissed the clinical importance of sleep disturbances, viewing them as the somatic expression of an instinctual disturbance which would disappear during psychoanalytic treatment, successive authors highlighted the fact that sleep disturbances might have a more specific psychological significance. The similarities between the loss of self that occurs during sleep and the fragmentation of the identity experienced during schizophrenia represent an interesting and yet not fully explored area of research. Thanks to Freud&amp;amp;rsquo;s work, the desire to sleep assumes the important role of a psychological, active factor that contributes to the occurrence and function of sleep.</p>

	<p>The blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) comprises distinct cell types, including endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, and is essential for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by selectively regulating molecular transport and maintaining integrity. In particular, astrocytes are essential for BBB function, as they maintain BBB integrity through their end-feet, which form a physical and biochemical interface that enhances endothelial cell function and barrier selectivity. Moreover, they secrete growth factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&amp;amp;beta;), which regulate tight junction (TJ) proteins (e.g., claudins and occludins) crucial for limiting paracellular permeability. Molecular motors like kinesins, dynein, and myosins are essential for these astrocyte functions. By facilitating vesicular trafficking and protein transport, they are essential for various functions, including trafficking of junctional proteins to support BBB integrity, the proper mitochondria localization within astrocyte processes for efficient energy supply, the polarized distribution of aquaporin (AQP)-4 at astrocyte end-feet for regulating water homeostasis across the BBB, and the modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, myosin motors modulate actomyosin dynamics to regulate astrocyte process outgrowth, adhesion, migration, and morphology, facilitating their functional roles. Thus, motor protein dysregulation in astrocytes can compromise BBB function and integrity, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. This review explores the complex interplay between astrocytes and molecular motors in regulating BBB homeostasis, which represents an attractive but poorly explored area of research.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Pediatric migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder that significantly impacts children&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life, academic performance, and social interactions. Unlike migraines in adults, pediatric migraines often present differently and involve unique underlying mechanisms, making diagnosis and treatment more complex. Methods: This review discusses the clinical phases of pediatric migraine, key trigger factors, sex- and age-related differences, and the role of childhood maltreatment in migraine development. We also discuss episodic syndromes such as cyclic vomiting syndrome, abdominal migraine, benign paroxysmal vertigo, and benign paroxysmal torticollis, along with comorbidities such as psychiatric disorders, sleep disturbances, and epilepsy. Results: The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for pediatric migraines, including genetic predispositions, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, are summarized. Current therapeutic strategies, including conventional and emerging pharmacological treatments, nutraceuticals, and non-pharmacological approaches, are evaluated. Non-pharmacological strategies, particularly evidence-based lifestyle interventions such as stress management, diet, hydration, sleep, exercise, screen time moderation, and cognitive behavioral therapy, are highlighted as key components of migraine prevention and management. The long-term prognosis and follow-up of pediatric migraine patients are reviewed, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, and tailored multidisciplinary care to prevent chronic progression. Conclusions: Future research should focus on novel therapeutic targets and integrating gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis modulation, with a need for longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term course of pediatric migraine.</p>

	<p>Background: The Delis&amp;amp;ndash;Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Tower Test (TT) is a widely used neuropsychological tool that assesses complex executive functions, including planning, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, switching, and impulsivity&amp;amp;mdash;key abilities often impaired in individuals with frontal dysfunction. Aims: There is currently no normative data for the D-KEFS TT in the Greek population. Consequently, it cannot be effectively used to detect executive dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric populations or for research purposes. Methods: The study sample included 249 healthy adults (28.9% male, 71.1% female) aged 20 to 85 years (M = 46.53, SD = 17.41), with educational levels ranging from secondary school graduates to master&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree holders. Pearson correlation was used to examine the relationship between age and D-KEFS TT performance, while chi-square test assessed the effects of education and gender. Normative data were then derived from raw scores and converted into percentiles. Results: Norms were established for the following D-KEFS TT variables: Total Achievement Score, Total Rule Violations, Move Accuracy Ratio, Mean First Move Time, and Time-per-Move Ratio. Age was the strongest predictor of performance, and normative data were stratified accordingly for the Greek adult population. Conclusions: This study introduces the D-KEFS TT as a neuropsychological assessment tool for Greek adults across different age groups to evaluate complex executive functions throughout the lifespan. Unlike other D-KEFS tests, the TT had not previously been adapted for the Greek population. This study is the first to provide normative data, supporting its use in clinical practice and research.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus discharge synchronously in a brain state-dependent manner to transfer information. Published studies have highlighted the temporal coordination of neuronal activities between the hippocampus and a neocortical area; however, how the spatial extent of neocortical activity relates to hippocampal activity remains partially unknown. We imaged mesoscopic neocortical activity while recording hippocampal local field potentials in anesthetized and unanesthetized GCaMP-expressing transgenic mice. We found that neocortical activity elevates around hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs). SWR-associated neocortical activities occurred predominantly in vision-related regions including the visual, retrosplenial, and frontal cortex. While pre-SWR neocortical activities were frequently observed in awake and natural sleeping states, post-SWR neocortical activity decreased significantly in the latter. Urethane-anesthetized mice also exhibited SWR-correlated calcium elevation, but in longer timescale than observed in natural sleeping mice. During hippocampal theta oscillation states, phase-locked oscillations of calcium activity were observed throughout the entire neocortical areas. In addition, possible environmental effects on neocortico-hippocampal dynamics were assessed in this study by comparing mice reared in ISO (isolated condition) and ENR (enriched environment). In both SWR and theta oscillations, mice reared in ISO exhibited clearer brain state-dependent dynamics than those reared in ENR. Our data demonstrate that the neocortex and hippocampus exhibit heterogeneous activity patterns that characterize brain states, and postnatal experience plays a significant role in modulating these patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/10/e0121242024?rss=1">Reduced Neural Responses to Natural Foreground versus Background Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday hearing, listeners face the challenge of understanding behaviorally relevant foreground stimuli (speech, vocalizations) in complex backgrounds (environmental, mechanical noise). Prior studies have shown that high-order areas of human auditory cortex (AC) preattentively form an enhanced representation of foreground stimuli in the presence of background noise. This enhancement requires identifying and grouping the features that comprise the background so they can be removed from the foreground representation. To study the cortical computations supporting this process, we recorded single-unit activity in AC of male and female ferrets during the presentation of concurrent natural sounds from these two categories. In contrast to expectations from studies in high-order AC, single-unit responses to foreground sounds were strongly reduced relative to the paired background in primary and secondary AC. The degree of reduction could not be explained by a neuron's preference for the foreground or background stimulus in isolation but could be partially explained by spectrotemporal statistics that distinguish foreground and background categories. Responses to synthesized sounds with statistics either matched or randomized relative to natural sounds showed progressively decreased reduction of foreground responses as natural sound statistics were removed. These results challenge the expectation that cortical foreground representations emerge directly from a mixed representation in the auditory periphery. Instead, they suggest the early AC maintains a robust representation of background noise. Strong background representations may produce a distributed code, facilitating selection of foreground signals from a relatively small subpopulation of AC neurons at later processing stages.</p>

                <p>The human hippocampus, essential for learning and memory, is implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, each linked to specific neuronal subpopulations. Advancing our understanding of hippocampal function requires computational models grounded in precise quantitative neuronal data. While extensive data exist on the neuronal composition and synaptic architecture of the rodent hippocampus, analogous quantitative data for the human hippocampus remain very limited. Given the critical role of local GABAergic interneurons in modulating hippocampal functions, we employed unbiased stereological techniques to estimate the density and total number of three major GABAergic cell types in the male and female human hippocampus: parvalbumin (PV)-expressing, somatostatin (SOM)-positive, and calretinin (CR)-positive interneurons. Our findings reveal an estimated 49,400 PV-positive, 141,500 SOM-positive, and 250,600 CR-positive interneurons per hippocampal hemisphere. Notably, CR-positive interneurons, which are primarily interneuron-selective in rodents, were present in humans at a higher proportion. Additionally, using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we estimated ~25 billion GABAergic synapses per hippocampal hemisphere, with PV-positive boutons comprising ~3.5 billion synapses, or 14% of the total GABAergic synapses. These findings contribute crucial quantitative insights for modeling human hippocampal circuits and understanding its complex regulatory dynamics.</p>

                <p>Individuals avoid spending cognitive effort unless expected rewards offset the perceived costs. Recent work employing tasks that provide explicit information about demands and incentives suggests causal involvement of the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in effort-based decision-making. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we examined whether the FPC's role in motivating effort generalizes to sequential choice problems in which task demand and reward rates vary indirectly and as a function of experience. In a double-blind, within-subject design, 46 participants (36 female, 8 male, 1 "neither/other") received anodal (i.e., excitatory) or sham stimulation over the right FPC during an Effort Foraging Task, which required choosing between harvesting patches for successively decreasing resources or traveling to replenished patches by performing a cognitive task with environment-specific difficulty. As expected, participants exited patches later (i.e., exhibited lower exit thresholds) when traveling required greater (versus less) effort, indicating increased travel costs in high-effort environments. Under anodal tDCS, the difference in exit thresholds between environments was significantly smaller relative to sham. Finally, individual differences analyses hint that participants with lower self-reported motivation to exert effort exhibited greater travel cost reductions following tDCS. Together, these findings support the theorized causal role of the FPC in motivating cognitively effortful behavior, expand its role to more ecologically valid serial decisions, and highlight the potential for tDCS as a tool to increase motivation with potential clinical applications.</p>

                <p>Hearing is an active process in which listeners must detect and identify sounds, segregate and discriminate stimulus features, and extract their behavioral relevance. Adaptive changes in sound detection can emerge rapidly, during sudden shifts in acoustic or environmental context, or more slowly as a result of practice. Although we know that context- and learning-dependent changes in the sensitivity of auditory cortical (ACX) neurons support many aspects of perceptual plasticity, the contribution of subcortical auditory regions to this process is less understood. Here, we recorded single- and multiunit activity from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and the ventral subdivision of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGV) of male and female Mongolian gerbils under two different behavioral contexts: as animals performed an amplitude modulation (AM) detection task and as they were passively exposed to AM sounds. Using a signal detection framework to estimate neurometric sensitivity, we found that neural thresholds in both regions improve during task performance, and this improvement is largely driven by changes in the firing rate rather than phase locking. We also found that ICC and MGV neurometric thresholds improve as animals learn to detect small AM depths during a multiday perceptual training paradigm. Finally, we revealed that in the MGV, but not the ICC, context-dependent enhancements in AM sensitivity grow stronger during perceptual training, mirroring prior observations in the ACX. Together, our results suggest that the auditory midbrain and thalamus contribute to changes in sound processing and perception over rapid and slow timescales.</p>

                <p>In literate adults, an area along the left posterior fusiform gyrus that is often referred to as the "visual word form area" (VWFA) responds particularly strongly to written characters compared with other visually similar stimuli. Theoretical accounts differ in whether they attribute the strong left-lateralization of the VWFA to a left-hemisphere (LH) bias toward visual features used in script, to competition of visual word form processing with that of other visual stimuli processed in the same general cortical territory (especially faces), or to the well established left-lateralization of the language system. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the last hypothesis by investigating lateralization of the VWFA in participants (male and female) who have right-hemisphere language due to a large LH perinatal stroke. Demographically matched controls were included for comparison. All participants had intact language skills and were proficient readers; age at testing ranged from 9.75&nbsp;years to early adulthood. Activation maps contrasting activation during rapid presentation of pseudowords and pictures of places revealed left-lateralized fusiform activation in controls, as expected. In participants with left-hemisphere perinatal stroke and right-lateralized language, the VWFA was instead found in the right fusiform gyrus, despite the fact that the left-hemisphere tissue normally occupied by the VWFA was intact and responded normally to pictures of places. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed right-lateralization for visual word form processing, both relative to place stimuli and relative to a resting baseline. This provides compelling evidence that the lateralization of the VWFA indeed follows that of the frontotemporal language system.</p>

                <p>Accumulation of astrocytes around &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms and significance remain unclear. Cell adhesion molecule protocadherin-C5 (Pcdh-C5) has been reported to implicate in AD. Here, we find elevated expression levels of Pcdh-C5 in the brain of 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice and A&beta;-treated astrocytes and further reveal that Pcdh-C5 deficiency leads to exacerbated A&beta; deposition in 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice. Deletion of Pcdh-C5 impairs astrocyte migration, astrocytic response to A&beta; signaling, and A&beta; phagocytosis in both cultured astrocytes in vitro and 5<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT>FAD mice in vivo. Both male and female mice were used in this study. Our findings support a model in which increased expression level of Pcdh-C5 promotes astrocyte migration in response to A&beta; signaling and engulfment and phagocytosis of neurotoxic A&beta; plaques, therefore exerting a critical neuroprotective function in AD.</p>

                <p>While the brain continues to develop during adolescence, such development may depend on sex-at-birth. However, the elucidation of such differences may be hindered by analytical decisions (e.g., covariate selection to address brain-size differences) and the typical reporting of cross-sectional data. To further evaluate adolescent cortical development, we analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, whose cohort of 11,000+ youth participants with biannual neuroimaging data collection can facilitate understanding neuroanatomical change during a critical developmental window. Doubly considering individual differences within the context of group-level effects, we analyzed regional changes in cortical thickness, sulcal depth, surface area, and volume between two timepoints (~2&nbsp;years apart) in 9- to 12-year-olds assigned male or female sex-at-birth. First, we conducted linear mixed-effect models to gauge how controlling for intracranial volume, whole-brain volume (WBV), or a summary metric (e.g., mean cortical thickness) influenced interpretations of age-dependent cortical change. Next, we evaluated the relative changes in thickness and surface area as a function of sex-at-birth and age. Here, we showed that WBV (thickness, sulcal depth, volume) and total cortical surface area were more optimal covariates; controlling for different covariates would have substantially altered our interpretations of overall and sex-at-birth-specific neuroanatomical development. Furthermore, we provided evidence to suggest that aggregate change in how cortical thickness is changing relative to surface area is generally comparable across those assigned male or female sex-at-birth, with corresponding change happening at slightly older ages in those assigned male sex-at-birth. Overall, these results help elucidate neuroanatomical developmental trajectories in early adolescence.</p>

                <p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are characterized by a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments. Determining how temporally specific alcohol exposure (AE) affects neural circuits is crucial to understanding the FASD phenotype. Third trimester AE can be modeled in rats by administering alcohol during the first two postnatal weeks, which damages the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC), structures whose functional interactions are required for working memory and executive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that AE during this period would impair working memory, disrupt choice behaviors, and alter mPFC&ndash;HPC oscillatory synchrony. To test this hypothesis, we recorded local field potentials from the mPFC and dorsal HPC as male and female AE and sham-intubated (SI) rats performed a spatial working memory task in adulthood and implemented algorithms to detect vicarious trial and errors (VTEs), behaviors associated with deliberative decision-making. We found that, compared with the SI group, the AE group performed fewer VTEs and demonstrated a disturbed relationship between VTEs and choice outcomes, while spatial working memory was unimpaired. This behavioral disruption was accompanied by alterations to mPFC and HPC oscillatory activity in the theta and beta bands, respectively, and a reduced prevalence of mPFC&ndash;HPC synchronous events. When trained on multiple behavioral variables, a machine learning algorithm could accurately predict whether rats were in the AE or SI group, thus characterizing a potential phenotype following third trimester AE. Together, these findings indicate that third trimester AE disrupts mPFC&ndash;HPC oscillatory interactions and choice behaviors.</p>

                <p>Cerebral amyloid-beta (A&beta;) accumulation, a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), precedes clinical impairment by two to three decades. However, it is unclear whether A&beta; contributes to subtle memory deficits observed during the preclinical stage. The heterogeneous emergence of A&beta; deposition may selectively impact certain memory domains, which rely on distinct underlying neural circuits. In this context, we tested whether specific domains of mnemonic discrimination, a neural computation essential for episodic memory, exhibit specific deficits related to early A&beta; deposition. We tested 108 cognitively unimpaired human older adults (66% female) who underwent 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (A&beta;-PET) and a control group of 35 young adults, on a suite of mnemonic discrimination tasks taxing object, spatial, and temporal domains. We hypothesized that A&beta; pathology would be selectively associated with temporal discrimination performance due to A&beta;'s propensity to accumulate in the basal frontotemporal cortex, which supports temporal processing. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a dissociation in which generalized age-related deficits were found for object and spatial mnemonic discrimination, while A&beta;-PET levels were selectively associated with deficits in temporal mnemonic discrimination. Furthermore, we found that higher A&beta;-PET levels in the medial orbitofrontal and inferior temporal cortex, regions supporting temporal processing, were associated with greater temporal mnemonic discrimination deficits, pointing to the selective vulnerability of circuits related to temporal processing early in AD progression. These results suggest that A&beta; accumulation within basal frontotemporal regions may disrupt temporal mnemonic discrimination in preclinical AD, and future work is needed to determine whether assessing temporal mnemonic discrimination can aid in predicting emerging AD progression.</p>

                <p>The brain's activity fluctuations have different temporal scales across the brain regions, with associative regions displaying slower timescales than sensory areas. This hierarchy of timescales has been shown to correlate with both structural brain connectivity and intrinsic regional properties. Here, using publicly available human resting-state fMRI and dMRI data, it was found that, while more structurally connected brain regions presented activity fluctuations with longer timescales, their activity fluctuations presented lower variance. The opposite relationships between the structural connectivity and the variance and temporal scales of resting-state fluctuations, respectively, were not trivially explained by simple network propagation principles. To understand these structure&ndash;function relationships, two commonly used whole-brain models were studied, namely, the Hopf and Wilson&ndash;Cowan models. These models use the brain's connectome to couple local nodes (representing brain regions) displaying noise-driven oscillations. The models show that the variance and temporal scales of activity fluctuations can oppositely relate to connectivity within specific parameter regions, even when all nodes have the same intrinsic dynamics&mdash;but also when intrinsic dynamics are constrained by the myelinization-related macroscopic gradient. These results show that, setting aside intrinsic regional differences, connectivity and network state are sufficient to explain the regional differences in fluctuations&rsquo; scales. State dependence supports the vision that structure&ndash;function relationships can serve as biomarkers of altered brain states. Finally, the results indicate that the hierarchies of timescales and variances reflect a balance between stability and responsivity, with greater and faster responsiveness at the network periphery, while the network core ensures overall system robustness.</p>

                <p>Regulation of food intake and energy balance is critical to survival. Hunger develops as a response to energy deficit and drives food-seeking and consumption. However, motivations to eat are varied in nature and promoted by factors other than energy deficit. When dysregulated, nonhomeostatic drives to consume can contribute to disorders of food intake, adding to the increasing prevalence of restrictive eating disorders and obesity. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons have been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior, in addition to a number of other fundamental behaviors including sleep, anxiety, and maternal behavior. Several studies suggest that MCH peptide increases food consumption, while studies of MCH neurons show effects only on cued feeding, and others show no effect of MCH neuron manipulation on feeding. MCH neurons have widespread projections to diverse downstream brain regions, yet few studies have investigated the function of specific projections or differentiated the behaviors they regulate. Here we use optogenetics, in combination with different behavioral paradigms, to elucidate the role of MCH projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in sleep and feeding behavior. We show that MCH neurons projecting to the NAc do not induce changes in baseline feeding or REM sleep but do enhance the preference for a food paired with optogenetic stimulation. Furthermore, this effect is diminished in female mice relative to males, in line with previous results suggesting sex differences in the functional role of MCH neurons. These results suggest that MCH projections to the NAc can enhance the rewarding value of consumed food.</p>

                <p>GABAergic neurons in basal forebrain (BF) nuclei project densely to all layers of the mouse main olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay in odor information processing. However, BF projection neurons are diverse, and the contribution of each subtype to odor information processing is not known. In the present study, we used retrograde and anterograde tracing methods together with whole-brain light&ndash;sheet analyses, patch-clamp recordings coupled with optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches during spontaneous odor discrimination, and go/no-go odor discrimination/learning tests to characterize the synaptic targets in the OB of BF calretinin-expressing (CR+) GABAergic cells and to reveal their functional implications. We used mice of either sex to show that OB-projecting CR+ neurons innervate the bulbar granule cell (GC) layer but not the glomerular layer. Optogenetic stimulation of CR+ axonal projections in OB slices elicited monosynaptic GABAergic currents in GCs. Retrograde rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing experiments confirmed these synaptic connections and further suggested that CR+ neurons provide the principal, if not the unique, BF input onto GCs. Chemogenetic inhibition of CR+ neurons in the BF of male mice did not affect odor discrimination in habituation/dishabituation tasks but led to impairment in odor learning during go/no-go odor&ndash;associative tasks. Our results revealed a subtype-specific projection pattern in the OB of a select population of BF neurons and suggested that distinct BF GABAergic projections have distinct effects on odor information processing and learning.</p>

                <p>Sensory systems enable organisms to detect and respond to environmental signals relevant for their survival and reproduction. A crucial aspect of any sensory signal is its intensity; understanding how sensory signals guide behavior requires probing sensory system function across the range of stimulus intensities naturally experienced by an organism. In olfaction, defining the range of natural odorant concentrations is difficult. Odors are complex mixtures of airborne chemicals emitting from a source in an irregular pattern that varies across time and space, necessitating specialized methods to obtain an accurate measurement of concentration. Perhaps as a result, experimentalists often choose stimulus concentrations based on empirical considerations rather than with respect to ecological or behavioral context. Here, we attempt to determine naturally relevant concentration ranges for olfactory stimuli by reviewing and integrating data from diverse disciplines. We compare odorant concentrations used in experimental studies in rodents and insects with those reported in different settings including ambient natural environments, the headspace of natural sources, and within the sources themselves. We also compare these values to psychophysical measurements of odorant detection threshold in rodents, where thresholds have been extensively measured. Odorant concentrations in natural regimes rarely exceed a few parts per billion, while most experimental studies investigating olfactory coding and behavior exceed these concentrations by several orders of magnitude. We discuss the implications of this mismatch and the importance of testing odorants in their natural concentration range for understanding neural mechanisms underlying olfactory sensation and odor-guided behaviors.</p>

                <p>Dynamic reconfigurations of the functional connectome across different connectivity states are highly heritable, predictive of cognitive abilities, and linked to mental health. Despite their established heritability, the specific polymorphisms that shape connectome dynamics are largely unknown. Given the widespread regulatory impact of modulatory neurotransmitters on functional connectivity, we comprehensively investigated a large set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of their receptors, metabolic enzymes, and transporters in 674 healthy adult subjects (347 females) from the Human Connectome Project. Preregistered modulatory neurotransmitter SNPs and dynamic connectome features entered a Stability Selection procedure with resampling. We found that specific subsets of these SNPs explain individual differences in temporal phenotypes of fMRI-derived connectome dynamics for which we previously established heritability. Specifically, noradrenergic polymorphisms explained Fractional Occupancy, i.e., the proportion of time spent in each connectome state, and cholinergic polymorphisms explained Transition Probability, i.e., the probability to transition between state pairs, respectively. This work identifies specific genetic effects on connectome dynamics via the regulatory impact of modulatory neurotransmitter systems. Our observations highlight the potential of dynamic connectome features as endophenotypes for neurotransmitter-focused precision psychiatry.</p>

                <p>Singular strategies for promoting axon regeneration and motor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) have been attempted with limited success. For instance, the deletion of <I>RhoA</I> and phosphatase and tensin homolog (<I>Pten</I>) (an extrinsic and intrinsic modulating factor, respectively) in corticospinal neurons (CSNs) promotes axon sprouting after thoracic SCI; however, it is unable to restore motor function. Here, we examine the effects of combining <I>RhoA/Pten</I> deletion in CSNs with chemogenetic neuronal stimulation on axonal growth and motor recovery after SCI in mice. We find that this combinatorial approach promotes greater axonal growth and presynaptic bouton formation in CSNs within the spinal cord compared with <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I> deletion alone. Furthermore, chemogenetic neuronal stimulation of <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I>-deleted CSNs improves forelimb performance in behavioral tasks after SCI compared with <I>RhoA</I>;<I>Pten</I> deletion alone. These results demonstrate that combination therapies pairing genetic modifications with neuronal stimulation can promote greater presynaptic formation and motor recovery following SCI than either strategy alone.</p>

                <p>Mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) act as an input convergence hub and transmit information to higher olfactory areas. Since first characterized, they have been classed as distinct projection neurons based on size and location: laminarly arranged MCs with a diameter larger than 20&nbsp;&micro;m in the mitral layer (ML) and smaller TCs spread across both the ML and external plexiform layers (EPL). Recent in vivo work has shown that these neurons encode complementary olfactory information, akin to parallel channels in other sensory systems. Yet, many ex vivo studies still collapse them into a single class, mitral/tufted, when describing their physiological properties and impact on circuit function. Using immunohistochemistry and whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp electrophysiology in fixed or acute slices from adult mice, we attempted to align in vivo and ex vivo data and test a soma size-based classifier of bulbar projection neurons using passive and intrinsic firing properties. We found that there is no clear separation between cell types based on passive or active properties. Rather, there is a heterogeneous continuum with three loosely clustered subgroups: TCs in the EPL, and putative tufted or putative MCs in the ML. These findings illustrate the large functional heterogeneity present within the OB projection neurons and complement existing literature highlighting how heterogeneity in sensory systems is preponderant and possibly used in the OB to decode complex olfactory information.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia are linked to accelerated aging leading to reduced lifespan, health span and cognitive decline. Cellular senescence, in which cells lose proliferative capacity and develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), plays a role in this process. Emerging research suggests that the senolytic regimen of dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q) reduces senescent cells, potentially mitigating age-related health and cognitive decline. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and safety of D+Q in older adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods This single-center study will recruit 30 participants total aged 50 years or older with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or 60 years or older with TRD; the difference in age limits is because individuals with schizophrenia are biologically about 10 years older than general population owing to metabolic burden. Each participant will receive two consecutive days of 100 mg oral dasatinib plus 1250 mg oral quercetin at baseline and weeks one through three, (i.e., two days on, five days off ) along with lifestyle risk management education. Questionnaires and assessments will measure health and cognitive function as well as psychiatric function at baseline, week 10, and one year. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will measure structural and functional brain health at baseline and 10 weeks. Blood sampling for SASP testing will occur at seven time points: baseline, weeks one through four, week 10, and one year. Conclusion This pilot aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the senolytic regimen and D+Q’s potential to counteract accelerated aging in adults with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and TRD. Trial registration Dasatinib Plus Quercetin for Accelerated Aging in Mental Disorders is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05838560; posted May 1, 2023.

                Background Physical activity is the second largest contributor to our total daily energy expenditure (EE). Uncovering ways to increase EE during activity could yield new approaches to treat obesity. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) regulates body weight by modulating muscle metabolism and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The VMH also mediates behavioral responses to predator threat. This thermogenic response is associated with weight loss and increased EE even when controlling for physical activity. While the VMH is a potential mediator of metabolic responses to predator threat, the mechanisms are unknown. Methods and Results Exposing rats to predator odor (PO) causes a rapid increase in skeletal muscle thermogenesis that peaks between 20-30 min and dissipates to baseline by 4 hr. To probe potential targets of PO-induced metabolic responses in the VMH, we first performed qPCR for genes known to be involved in brain regulation of muscle metabolism using VMH samples from rats exposed to PO or control odor for either 30 min or 4 hr. Next, to uncover novel, relevant genes, we performed RNA-sequencing on VMH samples of rats exposed to either PO or control odor for 20 min. qPCR results show that after 4 hr of PO exposure, Bdnf and Sirt1 expression were increased. RNA-sequencing analyses further identified 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that showed at least 1.5-fold change in expression due to PO exposure. Functional and Gene Ontology annotation showed that pathways related to immune response, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity were overrepresented among these DEGs. Discussion Taken together, these findings suggest that acute PO exposure induces both rapid and delayed changes in VMH gene expression that likely have downstream metabolic consequences.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                Shade selection is one of the most important factors that determines the satisfaction of the patient with the dental prosthesis and thus the overall success of the treatment. Conventional methods of shade selection require the presence of existing teeth or past dental/photographic records. Despite the presence of these records, shade selection continues to be challenging, subjective and arbitrarily based on the patient’s age and gender especially if the visual method is employed. This study aims to assess the prevalence, satisfaction, and preference of tooth shades in a cross section of the local Indian population, investigating their correlation with age, gender, and skin color in a diverse sample of 120 participants visiting the outpatient department of this Institution. Methods A total of 120 participants, 60 males and 60 females, categorized into four age (n=15): groups 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, & 50-60 yrs were recruited randomly and evaluated visually using the VITA 3D Master in the study. Participants were also asked about their satisfaction with existing tooth shades and their preferences. Results The most common existing tooth shade was Value 2 (52.5%). Statistical analysis using Chi-square tests revealed that Value 2 was the most desired shade among males and females alike, particularly in the age group of 41 to 50 years (p < 0.001). Shade 2L1.5 was the most prevalent (n=26), with Value 2 (59.16%) being the most sought-after shade, followed by Shade 2L1.5 (n=21), Shade 2M1 (n=18), Shade 1M1 (n=15), and Shade 2R1.5 (n=14). Existing tooth shades of Value 0 were the least common. The highest satisfaction with existing shades was observed in males aged 41 to 50 (n=15), followed by males aged 51 to 60 (n=14) and females aged 31 to 40 (n=12) and 41 to 50 (n=12). Significant differences in satisfaction were noted among males (p < 0.001). Conclusions This study reveals a consistent and strong preference among both males and females for tooth shades classified as Value 2, following the VITA Tooth-Guide 3D Master shade guide. This universal preference suggests the relevance and acceptance of this shade category across diverse patient groups.

                Background A growing movement of researcher-driven publishing projects has emerged in response to several challenges and shifts within the academic publishing landscape. One publishing initiative in this area are what we term community-led publishing projects (CPPs), which are produced entirely by academics, librarians and students without any involvement of the commercial publishing industry. CPPs are part of a growing global movement but their values and practices remain underexplored. This article presents findings on the landscape of CPPs at the University of Cambridge. Methods A landscape analysis was undertaken to identify and describe the various CPPs at Cambridge. A subset of 10 journal editors were subsequently interviewed to explore the practices, motivations and needs of these initiatives. Results Thirty-four CPPs were identified across a range of disciplines with a variety of publishing practices, open access status and professionalisation. From the interviews, CPPs were driven by an array of motivations including volunteers who are dedicated to their disciplines, who care for publishing, have a responsibility to disseminate their own research and who acknowledge the value these projects bring. They have complicated relationships with open access, being encouraged by public access to knowledge while maintaining a desire for print and being critical of some cultures of publishing brought on by the turn to openness. Practically, they employ a “DIY” approach due to the availability of resources but in doing so adhere to professional standards. Their success relies on collaboration and support, leveraging networks, technical and financial backing, and ensuring sustainability through careful handover. Conclusions This study helps us better understand the scope and practices of community-led publishing at a research-intensive university in the UK. It shows that CPPs are valuable for a variety of reasons and that universities, funders and governments should support such projects to ensure the preservation of unique scholarly content.

                Abstract* Background The rapid adoption of short-form video content has significantly transformed online content consumption patterns. This study investigates measures to mitigate the dual social and environmental impacts of short-form video platforms, addressing a critical gap in current literature where these dimensions have typically been studied in isolation. Methods Utilizing a dynamic data-driven simulation model, which is openly available for further research, and taking TikTok™ as a representative case study, we evaluate mitigation strategies across financial, content-based, and design interventions. Results Results indicate that while financial measures effectively reduce impacts, they could significantly affect platform revenue. Content-focused strategies and non-punitive design modifications show promise in promoting behavioural change and reducing addictive behaviours. A balanced combination of these approaches yields optimal outcomes, highlighting the necessity of a realistic and multi-pronged strategy for sustainable short-form video platforms. Conclusions This research provides valuable insights and tools for policymakers, platform designers, and companies, focused on creating a more sustainable short-form video industry. This work serves as a call to action, emphasizing the need for further sustainable advances in regulation and business models in the short-form video industry.

     alt="Dynamic Temporal Alterations of the Cerebellum in Parkinson's Disease With Different Dominant-Affected Sides"/>
<p>We first unveiled significant disparities in the dynamic temporal features of the cerebellum in Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls, and further in Parkinson's disease patients with differently affected dominant sides. These alterations are associated with motor deficits and sleep disturbances.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Laterality of motor deficits is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is strongly correlated with disease progression. The cerebellum is an important node in the motor-related network in PD. However, the role of the cerebellum in PD lateralization remains unclear. This study enrolled 48 left-dominant-affected PD patients (LPD), 60 right-dominant-affected PD patients (RPD) and 92 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We utilized dynamic functional connectivity and co-activation pattern analysis to investigate dynamic alterations of the cerebellum between PD patients and HCs by resting-state fMRI. Pearson partial correlation was used to measure brain-clinical correlations. We revealed two states and five co-activation patterns during the scans. Compared to HCs and RPD, LPD patients more frequently displayed State II and persisted in this state for a more extended period. The mean dwell time (MDT) in State II rose from HCs to RPD and to LPD. The MDT in State II was positively correlated with sleep disturbance in LPD patients. Regarding co-activation patterns (CAPs), LPD and RPD patients were less likely to exhibit CAP2. LPD patients were less likely to demonstrate CAP1 compared to HCs. The CAP1 metrics were positively associated with motor deficits in LPD patients. These results revealed the dynamic alterations of the cerebellum in different dominant-affected PD patients, which were related to motor deficits and sleep disturbances in PD patients. Our findings suggest that the dynamic cerebellar features may be significant factors in the lateralization of PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27222?af=R">Blood DDIT4 and TRIM13 Transcript Levels Mark the Early Stages of Machado–Joseph Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>An abundance of select transcripts and proteins has been found to be dysregulated in blood samples of Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) carriers. Here, we aimed to: (1) identify blood transcriptional changes as potential biomarkers of MJD; (2) correlate levels of differentially expressed blood transcripts with MJD carriers features; and (3) evaluate whether the identified differential abundance of blood transcripts in MJD patients is preserved in MJD brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used unbiased RNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess transcript levels in blood and brain samples, and western blot analysis to evaluate the abundance of specific proteins in brain samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed consistent dysregulation of <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> transcriptional levels in the blood of MJD patients from preclinical to symptomatic stages in Azorean and Brazilian cohorts. Combined blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcriptional levels show a very high accuracy to discriminate MJD carriers from matched controls (AUC ≥0.90). Levels of <i>P2RY13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset, and an abundance of <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with the expanded CAG repeat size in combined Azorean and Brazilian patients; and levels of <i>TRIM13</i> transcripts correlate with age at onset of early-stage Azorean patients. Moreover, the abundance of TRIM13 protein is increased in the cerebral cortex of MJD patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, blood <i>DDIT4</i> and <i>TRIM13</i> transcript levels are potential biomarkers of MJD. Cellular processes involving <i>DDIT4</i>, <i>TRIM13</i>, and <i>P2RY13</i> appear to be commonly dysregulated in the blood and brain of MJD patients, indicating the involvement of these genes in MJD pathogenesis.
