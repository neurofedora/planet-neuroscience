Abstract: We apply modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA) to assess multifractal dimensions of ON time series (ONTS) and complexity synchronization (CS) analysis to infer information transfer among ONs that are part of a network of organ networks (NoONs). The purpose of this paper is to advance the validation, standardization, and repeatability of MDEA and CS analysis of heterogeneous neurophysiological time series data. Results from processing these datasets show that the complexity of brain, heart, and lung ONTS significantly co-vary over time during cognitive task performance but that certain principles, guidelines, and strategies for the application of MDEA analysis need consideration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14633">Evaluating Representational Similarity Measures from the Lens of Functional Correspondence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14801">Minimizing information loss reduces spiking neuronal networks to differential equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neuronal networks (SNNs) are widely used in computational neuroscience, from biologically realistic modeling of local cortical networks to phenomenological modeling of the whole brain. Despite their prevalence, a systematic mathematical theory for finite-sized SNNs remains elusive, even for idealized homogeneous networks. The primary challenges are twofold: 1) the rich, parameter-sensitive SNN dynamics, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. These challenges pose significant difficulties when relating SNNs to systems of differential equations, leading previous studies to impose additional assumptions or to focus on individual dynamic regimes. In this study, we introduce a Markov approximation of homogeneous SNN dynamics to minimize information loss when translating SNNs into ordinary differential equations. Our only assumption for the Markov approximation is the fast self-decorrelation of synaptic conductances. The system of ordinary differential equations derived from the Markov model effectively captures high-frequency partial synchrony and the metastability of finite-neuron networks produced by interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations. Besides accurately predicting dynamical statistics, such as firing rates, our theory also quantitatively captures the geometry of attractors and bifurcation structures of SNNs. Thus, our work provides a comprehensive mathematical framework that can systematically map parameters of single-neuron physiology, network coupling, and external stimuli to homogeneous SNN dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15078">Functional dissociations versus post-hoc selection: Moving beyond the Stockart et al. (2024) compromise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stockart et al. (2024) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that are far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14773">Mode-conditioned music learning and composition: a spiking neural network inspired by neuroscience and psychology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musical mode is one of the most critical element that establishes the framework of pitch organization and determines the harmonic relationships. Previous works often use the simplistic and rigid alignment method, and overlook the diversity of modes. However, in contrast to AI models, humans possess cognitive mechanisms for perceiving the various modes and keys. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network inspired by brain mechanisms and psychological theories to represent musical modes and keys, ultimately generating musical pieces that incorporate tonality features. Specifically, the contributions are detailed as follows: 1) The model is designed with multiple collaborated subsystems inspired by the structures and functions of corresponding brain regions; 2)We incorporate mechanisms for neural circuit evolutionary learning that enable the network to learn and generate mode-related features in music, reflecting the cognitive processes involved in human music perception. 3)The results demonstrate that the proposed model shows a connection framework closely similar to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler model, which is one of the most significant key perception models in the music psychology domain. 4) Experiments show that the model can generate music pieces with characteristics of the given modes and keys. Additionally, the quantitative assessments of generated pieces reveals that the generating music pieces have both tonality characteristics and the melodic adaptability needed to generate diverse and musical content. By combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and music theory with advanced neural network architectures, our research aims to create a system that not only learns and generates music but also bridges the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14991">Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS): Active inference with interpretability</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the free energy principle (FEP) and active inference (AIF) have achieved many successes connecting conceptual models of learning and cognition to mathematical models of perception and action. This effort is driven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of self-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various reinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been proposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent work has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments by incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take an alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we attempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by introducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards only, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable environments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a given task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free energy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced to deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous hidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired from behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a partially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the ambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their observations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal policies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03238">A Joint Network Optimization Framework to Predict Clinical Severity from Resting State Functional MRI Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2009.03238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework to predict clinical severity from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our model consists of two coupled terms. The first term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of representative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks are modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental patterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via patient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear regression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a measure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate datasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second dataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD database. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which employ conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning techniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our joint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI correlation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly identifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.

Abstract: Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.

                arXiv:2411.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution by natural selection, which is one of the most compelling themes of modern science, brought forth evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, applying mechanisms of evolution in nature to various problems solved by computers. In this paper we concentrate on evolutionary automata that constitute an analogous model of evolutionary computation compared to well-known evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary automata provide a more complete dual model of evolutionary computation, similar like abstract automata (e.g., Turing machines) form a more formal and precise model compared to recursive algorithms and their subset - evolutionary algorithms. An evolutionary automaton is an automaton that evolves performing evolutionary computation perhaps using an infinite number of generations. This model allows for a direct modeling evolution of evolution, and leads to tremendous expressiveness of evolutionary automata and evolutionary computation. This also gives the hint to the power of natural evolution that is self-evolving by interactive feedback with the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15111">Learnable Activation Functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</a></h4>

Abstract: We investigate the use of learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Specifically, we compare the efficacy of traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and learnable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which employ learnable basis functions. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as an effective method for directly incorporating physical laws into the learning process, offering a data-efficient solution for both the forward and inverse problems associated with PDEs. However, challenges such as effective training and spectral bias, where low-frequency components are learned more effectively, often limit their applicability to problems characterized by rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. By employing different activation or basis functions on MLP and KAN, we assess their impact on convergence behavior and spectral bias mitigation, and the accurate approximation of PDEs. The findings offer insights into the design of neural network architectures that balance training efficiency, convergence speed, and test accuracy for PDE solvers. By evaluating the influence of activation or basis function choices, this work provides guidelines for developing more robust and accurate PINN models. The source code and pre-trained models used in this study are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and future exploration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14462">Activation Functions for "A Feedforward Unitary Equivariant Neural Network"</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Ma and Chan (2023)], we presented a feedforward unitary equivariant neural network. We proposed three distinct activation functions tailored for this network: a softsign function with a small residue, an identity function, and a Leaky ReLU function. While these functions demonstrated the desired equivariance properties, they limited the neural network's architecture. This short paper generalises these activation functions to a single functional form. This functional form represents a broad class of functions, maintains unitary equivariance, and offers greater flexibility for the design of equivariant neural networks.

                arXiv:2411.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous article, we introduced a neural network framework based on symmetric differential equations. This novel framework exhibits complete symmetry, endowing it with perfect mathematical properties. While we have examined some of the system's mathematical characteristics, a detailed discussion of the network training methodology has not yet been presented. Drawing on the principles of the traditional backpropagation algorithm, this study proposes an alternative training approach that utilizes differential equation signal propagation instead of chain rule derivation. This approach not only preserves the effectiveness of training but also offers enhanced biological interpretability. The foundation of this methodology lies in the system's reversibility, which stems from its inherent symmetry,a key aspect of our research. However, this method alone is insufficient for effective neural network training. To address this, we further introduce a distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control approach, emphasizing its implementation within a closed system. By incorporating this method, we achieved both faster training speeds and improved accuracy. This approach not only offers novel insights into neural network training but also extends the scope of research into control methodologies. To validate its effectiveness, we apply this method to the MNIST dataset, demonstrating its practical utility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12603">STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.

                arXiv:2411.13010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation functions play a crucial role in introducing non-linearities to deep neural networks. We propose a novel approach to designing activation functions by focusing on their gradients and deriving the corresponding functions through integration. Our work introduces the Expanded Integral of the Exponential Linear Unit (xIELU), a trainable piecewise activation function derived by integrating trainable affine transformations applied on the ELU activation function. xIELU combines two key gradient properties: a trainable and linearly increasing gradient for positive inputs, similar to ReLU$^2$, and a trainable negative gradient flow for negative inputs, akin to xSiLU. Conceptually, xIELU can be viewed as extending ReLU$^2$ to effectively handle negative inputs. In experiments with 1.1B parameter Llama models trained on 126B tokens of FineWeb Edu, xIELU achieves lower perplexity compared to both ReLU$^2$ and SwiGLU when matched for the same compute cost and parameter count.

                arXiv:2411.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor diagnosis by providing clear visualization of soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. Given the increasing incidence of brain tumors, there is an urgent need for reliable diagnostic tools, as misdiagnoses can lead to harmful treatment decisions and poor outcomes. While machine learning has significantly advanced medical diagnostics, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. Methods: This study proposes a hybrid model that integrates MobileNetV2 for feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the classification of brain tumors. The model was trained and validated using the Kaggle MRI brain tumor dataset, which includes 7023 images categorized into four types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. MobileNetV2&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficient architecture was leveraged for feature extraction, and SVM was used to enhance classification accuracy. Results: The proposed hybrid model showed excellent results, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.99 for glioma, 0.97 for meningioma, and 1.0 for both pituitary tumors and the no tumor class. These findings highlight that the MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid not only improves classification accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, making it suitable for broader clinical use. Conclusions: The MobileNetV2-SVM hybrid model demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing brain tumor diagnostics by offering a balance of precision and computational efficiency. Its ability to maintain high accuracy while operating efficiently could lead to better outcomes in medical practice, particularly in resource limited settings.</p>

	<p>Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is among the most prevalent chronic autoimmune disorders affecting the central nervous system. In Poland, the MS incidence rate is 6.3 per 100,000 patients. The results of studies indicate that people suffering from MS are less involved in sexual life in both the physical and emotional aspects, they assess that sex is less important to them than to healthy people, and their sexual motivation is limited, especially its physical dimension. Methods: A total of 121 people participated in the study. It used four questionnaires: authors&amp;amp;rsquo; survey on sociodemographic and biomedical data, Short Sexual Well-Being Scale, Guy&amp;amp;rsquo;s Neurological Disability Scale, and Expanded Disability Status Scale. Results: A positive and moderate relationship was found between neurological disability and physical disability. Also, the correlation between neurological disability and the number of sexual dysfunctions was significant. Problems in the neurological sphere were also negatively associated with sexual well-being. Physical disability was not significantly associated with the level of sexual well-being or the number of declared sexual dysfunctions. The number of dysfunctions was moderately associated with the levels of sexual well-being. The polynomial regression analyses did not find any non-linear relationships between the severity of disability and sexual well-being. Conclusions: This study suggests that the occurrence of sexual dysfunctions can be an important subject in MS patients&amp;amp;rsquo; sexual well-being. It underlines the fact that the subject of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s sexuality cannot be omitted while providing medical and psychological support for individuals with MS.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study explores whether sex differences in reactive aggression (RA) and proactive aggression (PA) are attributable to sex, gender role orientation, or their interaction and explores the neuroanatomical characteristics of these sex differences. Methods: In a sample of 108 males and 126 females, we examined the sex-by-gender role orientation interaction on RA, PA, and brain gray matter volume (GMV). Then, we explored the relationship between aggression and regional GMV. Results: When the effects of sex and gender role orientation on aggression were disentangled, there were no sex differences in RA, regardless of gender role orientation. However, sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) in PA were observed within the masculine group but not within the feminine group. Brain imaging results revealed sex differences (male &amp;amp;gt; female) on the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV, a region involved in cognitive control, within the masculine group. Moreover, a negative association between PA and the right inferior frontal gyrus GMV was observed in masculine females rather than masculine males. Conclusions: These findings indicate that gender role orientation has a more significant effect on aggression than sex, particularly with regard to PA, and hint that the goal of cognitive control involved in displaying PA differs in masculine males and masculine females.</p>

">Brain Feature Maps Reveal Progressive Animal-Feature Representations in the Ventral Stream.</a></h4>

              
                What are the fundamental units of representation in the primate visual brain? While objects have become an intuitive framework for studying neurons in many parts of cortex, it is possible that neurons follow a more expressive organizational principle, such as encoding generic features present across textures, places, and objects. In this study, we used multi-electrode arrays to record from neurons in early (V1/V2), middle (V4), and late (posterior inferotemporal cortex (PIT)) areas across the visual hierarchy, estimating the local operation of each neuron over the entire visual scene. These estimates, called "heatmaps," approximate the weight sharing operation of convolutional neural networks. We found that while populations of neurons across V1, V4, and PIT responded over the full scene, they focused on salient sub-regions within object outlines. The best captured object feature class belonged to animals, not general objects, as a trend that increased over the visual hierarchy. These results show that the monkey ventral stream is partially organized to encode local animal features over objects, even as early as primary visual cortex.

ELS can permanently alter the brain, leading to cognitive impairment, increased sensitivity to future stressors, and mental health risks. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region implicated in the effects of ELS. Methods: To better understand the effects of ELS on the PFC, we ran a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets. We identified five datasets (GSE89692, GSE116416, GSE14720, GSE153043, GSE124387) that characterized the long-term effects of multi-day postnatal ELS paradigms (maternal separation, limited nesting/bedding) in male and female laboratory rodents (rats, mice). The outcome variable was gene expression in the PFC later in adulthood as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct the meta-analysis, preprocessed gene expression data were extracted from the Gemma database. Following quality control, the final sample size was n=89: n=42 controls & n=47 ELS: GSE116416 n=23 (no outliers); GSE116416 n=44 (2 outliers); GSE14720 n=7 (no outliers); GSE153043 n=9 (1 outlier), and GSE124387 n=6 (no outliers). Differential expression was calculated using the limma pipeline followed by an empirical Bayes correction. For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the ELS vs. Control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 11,885 genes, identifying five genes with differential expression following ELS (false discovery rate< 0.05): transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (Iqgap3), collagen, type XI, alpha 1 (Col11a1), claudin 11 (Cldn11) and myelin associated glycoprotein (Mag), all of which were downregulated. Broadly, gene sets associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and brain development were downregulated following ELS. In contrast, genes previously shown to be upregulated in Major Depressive Disorder patients were upregulated following ELS. Conclusion: These findings suggest that ELS during critical periods of development may produce long-term effects on the efficiency of transmission in the PFC and drive changes in gene expression similar to those underlying depression.

">Controlling Reciprocity in Binary and Weighted Networks: A Novel Density-Conserving Approach</a></h4>

              
                We introduce efficient Network Reciprocity Control (NRC) algorithms for steering the degree of asymmetry and reciprocity in binary and weighted networks while preserving fundamental network properties. Our methods maintain edge density in binary networks and cumulative edge weight in weighted graphs. We test these algorithms on synthetic benchmark networks-including random, small-world, and modular structures- as well as brain connectivity maps (connectomes) from various species. We demonstrate how adjusting the asymmetry-reciprocity balance under edge density and total weight constraints influences key network features, including spectral properties, degree distributions, community structure, clustering, and path lengths. Additionally, we present a case study on the computational implications of graded reciprocity by solving a memory task within the reservoir computing framework. Furthermore, we establish the scalability of the NRC algorithms by applying them to networks of increasing size. These approaches enable systematic investigation of the relationship between directional asymmetry and network topology, with potential applications in computational and network sciences, social network analysis, and other fields studying complex network systems where the directionality of connections is essential.

">The Alzheimers Disease Risk Genes MS4A4A And MS4A6A Cooperate to Negatively Regulate Trem2 and Microglia states</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variations in MS4A4A and MS4A6A are linked to the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels and are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and progression. Using CRISPR knockout and MS4A4A-degrading antibodies in primary human microglia, non-human primates (NHP), and a xenotransplantation model of amyloid pathology, we provide evidence that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are negative regulators of both the transmembrane and soluble TREM2 proteins. They also negatively regulate microglia proliferation, survival, metabolism, lysosomal function, energetics, phagocytosis, and disease-fighting states. Mechanistically, we find that MS4A4A exerts negative regulation by interacting with MS4A6A and protecting it from degradation. MS4A6A in turn forms a complex with and blocks the co-receptor DAP12, which is required for the stability, cell surface localization, and signaling of TREM2 and other receptors. Taken together, the data indicate that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are cooperating, post-transcriptional negative regulators of TREM2 and microglial function, and potential drug targets for AD.

">Triple network dynamics and future alcohol consumption in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Human neuroimaging increasingly suggests that the brain is best modeled as a highly interconnected and dynamic system. However, novel methodology for studying functional brain network dynamics have never been applied to the study of adolescent alcohol consumption. We sought to determine whether brain network dynamics are related to future drinking behavior in teenagers. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series from 17-year-old non/low drinking participants (n=295) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study were used to fit a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). Regions of the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN), collectively known as the Triple Network, were included in modeling. The HSMM identified the most-likely state sequence for each participant, a trajectory through distinct brain network states over the course of their fMRI scan. Poisson regression models were used to assess relationships between state sequence metrics and future drinking frequency. Potential sex differences in state sequence metrics or the relationship between sequence metrics and future drinking were assessed with permutation testing and interactions in regression models. Results: No sex differences in state sequence metrics were observed. However, the relationship between occupancy times and future drinking frequency differed by sex for two brain states. In the full sample, occupancy time in a state characterized by high interconnectivity between the SN and CEN was negatively associated with drinking. Occupancy time in a separate state characterized by high activation in the DMN and SN, but low activation in the CEN, was negatively associated with future drinking. Conclusions: Brain network dynamics may be useful neural markers of predisposition to drinking in adolescents. Brain states which make teens vulnerable or resilient to drinking may differ between sexes.

">Single-unit activations confer inductive biases for emergent circuit solutions to cognitive tasks</a></h4>

              
                Trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become the leading framework for modeling neural dynamics in the brain, owing to their capacity to mimic how population-level computations arise from interactions among many units with heterogeneous responses. RNN units are commonly modeled using various nonlinear activation functions, assuming these architectural differences do not affect emerging task solutions. Contrary to this view, we show that single-unit activation functions confer inductive biases that influence the geometry of neural population trajectories, single-unit selectivity, and fixed point configurations. Using a model distillation approach, we find that differences in neural representations and dynamics reflect qualitatively distinct circuit solutions to cognitive tasks emerging in RNNs with different activation functions, leading to disparate generalization behavior on out-of-distribution inputs. Our results show that seemingly minor architectural differences provide strong inductive biases for task solutions, raising a question about which RNN architectures better align with mechanisms of task execution in biological networks.

">mTOR inhibition alleviated tau phosphorylation-induced mitochondrial impairment, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Aim: Hyperphosphorylated tau plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) directly interacts with the Tau protein at Ser214, Ser356 and Thr231 is not clear. This study aimed to investigate whether mTOR-regulated tau phosphorylation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and function and whether rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, can modulate tau phosphorylation levels and attenuate AD-related alterations. Methods: Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were used to intracranially deliver the TauS214E/T231E/S356E (Tau3E) variant into 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice. The mice were intraperitoneally administered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin for one week, followed by assessment via the Morris water maze test. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and flow cytometry were employed to measure the expression levels of mTOR, p70S6K, and tau; mitochondrial dynamics; and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HT22 cells and a mouse model overexpressing Tau3E, as well as in postmortem brain tissues from AD patients. Results: p-mTORS2448 colocalized with p-TauSer214, p-TauSer356, and p-TauThr231 in the hippocampal CA3 region of AD patients. HT22 cells and C57BL/6 mice overexpressing Tau3E presented elevated levels of p-mTOR, downstream target p-p70S6K, and ROS production; mitochondrial fragmentation; and p-TauSer214, p-TauSer356, and p-TauThr231. Rapamycin treatment partially mitigated the cognitive and molecular alterations in Tau3E mice. Conclusion: This study revealed a causal link between Tau phosphorylation at Ser214, Ser356, and p-Thr231 and mTOR upregulation and downstream impairments in ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive function. Treatment using mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (i.p.) can alleviate impairment, reduce p-Tau and restore mitochondrial homeostasis, neuronal loss and cognitive impairment in mice.

">Separating three variability and noise sources in the response fluctuation of brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are among the few directly observable responses to suprathreshold brain stimulation and serve a variety of applications. If the MEP size is graphed over the stimulation strength, they form an input-output (IO), recruitment, or dose-response curve. Previous statistical models with two variability sources inherently consider the small MEPs at the low plateau as part of the neural recruitment properties. However, recent studies demonstrated that small MEP responses are contaminated and over-shadowed by background noise of mostly technical quality and suggested that the recruitment curve should continue below this noise level. This work intends to separate physiological variability from background noise and improve the description of recruitment behaviour. We developed a model with three variability sources and a logarithmic logistic function without a lower plateau. Compared to previous models, we incorporated an additional source for background noise from amplifiers, electrode impedance, and remote bioelectric activity, which form the obesrved low-side plateau. Compared to the dual-variability source modes, our approach better described IO characteristics, evidenced by lower Bayesian Information Criterion scores across all subjects and pulse shapes. The model independently extracted hidden variability information across the stimulated neural system and isolated it from background noise, which led to an accurate estimation of the IO curve parameters. This new model offers a robust tool to analyse brain stimulation IO curves in clinical and experimental neuroscience, reducing the risk of spurious results from inappropriate statistical methods. By providing a more accurate representation of MEP responses and variability sources, this approach advances our understanding of cortical excitability and may improve the assessment of neuromodulation effects.

">Visual speech enhances auditory onset timing and envelope tracking through distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Seeing the face of a speaker facilitates speech recognition in challenging listening environments. Prior work has shown that visual speech contains timing information to aid auditory speech processing, yet how these signals are integrated within the auditory system during audiovisual speech perception remains poorly understood. Observation of preparatory mouth movements may initiate phase reset of intrinsic oscillations, potentially sensitizing the auditory system for receptive speech processing, while observation of mouth movements post speech onset may facilitate entrainment to the speech envelope. Yet, little work has been done to test whether visual speech enhances encoding of auditory speech onset, speech envelope tracking, or both, and through independent or overlapping mechanisms. To investigate this, we examined the ways in which visual speech timing information alters theta band power and phase using human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in a large group of patients with epilepsy (n = 21). Prior to speech onset, preparatory mouth movements elicited theta phase reset (increased inter-trial phase coherence; ITPC) throughout the superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is thought to enhance speech onset encoding. Following speech onset, visual speech modulated theta ITPC only at anterior STG electrodes while theta power was modulated at posterior STG electrodes. Pre- and post-speech onset were spatially and temporally dissociated, consistent with the hypothesis that audiovisual speech onset encoding and envelope tracking mechanisms are partially distinct. Crucially, congruent and incongruent visual speech, designed here to have identical visual timing information about speech onset time, but different visual mouth evolution, produced only a small difference in the phase of theta band oscillations in the anterior STG, highlighting a more restricted role of visual speech in ongoing auditory entrainment. These results support the hypothesis that visual speech improves the precision of auditory speech encoding through two separate mechanisms, with auditory speech onset encoded throughout the entire STG and ongoing speech envelope tracking within anterior STG.

">Global Neuron Shape Reasoning with Point Affinity Transformers</a></h4>

              
                Connectomics is a subfield of neuroscience that aims to map the brains intricate wiring diagram. Accurate neuron segmentation from microscopy volumes is essential for automating connectome reconstruction. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms use image-based convolutional neural networks that are limited to local neuron shape context. Thus, we introduce a new framework that reasons over global neuron shape with a novel point affinity transformer. Our framework embeds a (multi-)neuron point cloud into a fixed-length feature set from which we can decode any point pair affinities, enabling clustering neuron point clouds for automatic proofreading. We also show that the learned feature set can easily be mapped to a contrastive embedding space that enables neuron type classification using a simple KNN classifier. Our approach excels in two demanding connectomics tasks: proofreading segmentation errors and classifying neuron types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets derived from state-of-the-art connectomes, our method outperforms point transformers, graph neural networks, and unsupervised clustering baselines.

">Transcriptional Regulation of Neuropeptide Receptors Decodes Complexity of Peptidergic Modulation of Behavior and Physiology.</a></h4>

              
                The modulation of complex behaviors in response to environmental and physiological contexts is a fundamental aspect of animal biology, with neuropeptides (NPs) playing a crucial role in this process. This study investigates the transcriptional regulation of neuropeptide receptors (NPRs) as a mechanism for context-dependent neuropeptidergic modulation of physiology and behavior. We hypothesize that the transcriptional control of NPR genes, rather than the NPs themselves, is a critical determinant in the context-dependent modulation of behavior and physiology. Using a multi-faceted approach, including comparative genomics, transcription factor network analysis, and empirical validation in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, we reveal a complex regulatory landscape where NPR expression is tightly controlled. Our findings demonstrate that NPR genes exhibit a higher number of enhancers, CTCF-binding sites, and open chromatin regions compared to NP genes, suggesting a greater susceptibility to transcriptional modulation. This regulatory architecture allows for precise control over neuropeptidergic signaling, enabling dynamic and context-specific behavioral and physiological responses. Our results highlight the importance of NPR-expressing cells by transcriptional regulation in mediating the effects of NPs on behavior and physiology. We show that this regulation is conserved across species, indicating an evolutionarily significant mechanism for fine-tuning neuropeptidergic signaling. Furthermore, our study provides insights into the distinct regulatory mechanisms underlying the multifunctionality of NPs and their receptors, offering a novel perspective on the transcriptional control of complex behaviors. In conclusion, this study advances our understanding of neuropeptidergic signaling by focusing on the transcriptional regulation of NPRs. Our findings have broad implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting neuropeptidergic systems in various neurological and behavioral disorders.

">Unbiased data-driven analysis of five amyloid-beta peptides for biomarker investigations in familial Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Changes to the relative abundance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). iPSC-derived neurons offer a physiological model of Abeta production. We employed unbiased, data-driven analyses to investigate combinations of Abeta peptides as AD biomarkers and the relative contribution of peptides to AD pathogenesis. METHODS: We measured Abeta;37, Abeta;38, Abeta;40, Abeta;42 and Abeta;43 in ten iPSC-neuronal cultures from PSEN1 mutation carriers. We combined these data with published cell model data and used linear weighted combinations to 1) distinguish AD from controls, and 2) predict age-at-onset for PSEN1 mutations. RESULTS: Data-driven approaches distinguished Abeta;42 and Abeta;43 from shorter peptides, providing unbiased evidence for their contribution to disease. Weighted linear combinations of Abeta peptides outperform Abeta;42/40 and provide insights into relative peptide contribution as biomarkers; the optimal ratio for all data is represented as 21 . Abeta37 + 10. Abeta38+ 69 . Abeta40/(94 . Abeta42 + 6 . Abeta43). DISCUSSION: The algorithm discovered herein can be further refined to improve biomarkers for AD.

">Innervation density governs crosstalk of GPCR-based norepinephrine and dopamine sensors</a></h4>

              
                GPCR-based fluorescent sensors are widely used to correlate neuromodulatory signaling with brain function. While experiments in transfected cells often reveal selectivity for individual neurotransmitters, sensor specificity in the brain frequently remains uncertain. Pursuing experiments in brain slices and in vivo, we find that norepinephrine and dopamine cross-activate the respective sensors. Non-specific activation occurred when innervation of the cross-reacting transmitter was high, and silencing of specific innervation was indispensable for interpreting sensor fluorescence.

">Task-induced internal bodily rather than brain states regulate human self-perception</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental ability for us is to identify and distinguish with others, known as the self, whose neural substrate is hard to identify by external self-related stimuli because of possible interference from internal self-related states of both body and brain. Using the same stimuli, we ruled out this dilemma by manipulating human subjects performing own- and celebrity-face discrimination tasks to induce self-related and non-self-related states, respectively. Results showed that stimulus-driven sensory sensory differences among own-, celebrity-, and stranger-faces were independent of task-induced internal states, whereas their perceptual differences were strongly modulated by these states. Intriguingly, we further found that subjects' bodily (indexed by heartbeat-evoked potentials) rather than brain (indexed by pre-stimulus -powers) states not only predicated their self-perception but also moderated the relationship between external stimuli and self-perception. Our results reveal for the first time an adaptive self-perception, shaped by not only external stimuli but also internal states, especially the interoception.

                Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold exciting therapeutic potential, but tissue damage caused by probe insertion limits channel count. Biohybrid devices, in which the cell-device interface is crafted in the laboratory, hold promise to address this limitation, but these devices have lacked a demonstration of their applicability for BCI. We developed a biohybrid approach to engraft optogenetically-enabled neurons on the cortical surface housed in a 2D-scaffold of circular microwells. The engrafted neurons survived, exhibited spontaneous activity, and integrated with the host brain several weeks after implantation. We then trained mice with biohybrid implants to perform an optical stimulation task and showed that they could effectively report optogenetic stimulation of their neural graft. This demonstration shows that a cortical biohybrid implant can be used to transmit information to the brain of an implanted animal.

">Divergent Visuomotor Strategies in Teleosts: Neural Circuit Mechanisms in Zebrafish and Danionella cerebrum</a></h4>

              
                Many animals respond to sensory cues with species-specific coordinated movements to successfully navigate their environment. However, the neural mechanisms that support diverse sensorimotor transformations across species with distinct navigational strategies remain largely unexplored. By comparing related teleost species, zebrafish (Danio rerio, ZF) and Danionella cerebrum (DC), we investigated behavioral patterns and neural architectures during the visually guided optomotor response (OMR). Closed-loop behavioral tracking during visual stimulation revealed that larval ZF employ burst-and-glide locomotion, while larval DC display continuous, smooth swimming punctuated with sharp directional turns. Although DC achieve higher average speeds, they lack the direction-dependent velocity modulation observed in ZF. Whole-brain two-photon calcium imaging and tail tracking in head-fixed fish reveals that both species exhibit direction-selective motion encoding in homologous regions, including the retinorecipient pretectum, with DC exhibiting fewer binocular, direction-selective neurons overall. Kinematic analysis of head-fixed behavior reveals that DC sustain significantly longer directed swim events across all stimuli than ZF, highlighting the divergent visuomotor strategies, with ZF reducing tail movement duration in response to oblique, turn-inducing stimuli. Lateralized motor-associated neural activity in the medial and anterior hindbrain of both species suggests a shared circuit motif, with distinct neural circuits that independently control movement vigor and direction. These findings highlight the diversity in visuomotor strategies among teleost species, underscored by shared sensorimotor neural circuit motifs, and establish a robust framework for unraveling the neural mechanisms driving continuous and discrete visually guided locomotion, paving the way for deeper insights into vertebrate sensorimotor functions.

                The dynamic allocation of neural resources throughout brain-wide networks is essential for optimal brain operation. However, the neural principles underlying the facilitation of such allocation remain inadequately understood. In this work, we address this gap by uncovering brain-wide coherent causal structures in resting-state fMRI timeseries data. We identified five distinct and interpretable modes of signal propagation that most effectively predict future blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Each identified mode uniquely represents specific aspects of neural resource allocation among established networks: (1) signal propagation along cortical hierarchy; (2) the salience network's modulation between default mode and the central executive networks; (3) the mapping between visual and sensorimotor areas with frontal modulation; and (4) interhemispheric interaction. Notably, four of these modes were associated with the default mode network, highlighting its central role as a functional hub. Collectively, these modes account for a broad spectrum of well-known dynamical properties in the brain. Importantly, individual variability in these modes correlates with general cognitive abilities, is influenced by genetic factors, and exhibits stability across different cognitive tasks. Together, these modes not only integrate previously disparate phenomena observed in fMRI data but also offer a concise framework for characterizing individual functional fingerprints within BOLD signals.

	<p>Objectives: Cerebral edema, a prevalent consequence of brain injury, is associated with significant mortality and disability. Timely diagnosis and monitoring are crucial for patient prognosis. There is a pressing clinical demand for a real-time, non-invasive cerebral edema monitoring method. Ultrasound methods are prime candidates for such investigations due to their non-invasive nature. Methods: Acute cerebral edema was introduced in rats by permanently occluding the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Ultrasonic echo signals were collected at nine time points over a 24 h period to extract features from both the time and frequency domains. Concurrently, histomorphological changes were examined. We utilized support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LogR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) algorithms for classifying cerebral edema types, and SVM, RF, linear regression (LR), and feedforward neural network (FNNs) for predicting the cerebral infarction volume ratio. Results: The integration of 16 ultrasonic features associated with cerebral edema development with the RF model enabled effective classification of cerebral edema types, with a high accuracy rate of 97.9%. Additionally, it provided an accurate prediction of the cerebral infarction volume ratio, with an R2 value of 0.8814. Conclusions: Our proposed strategy classifies cerebral edema and predicts the cerebral infarction volume ratio with satisfactory precision. The fusion of ultrasound echo features with machine learning presents a promising non-invasive approach for the monitoring of cerebral edema.</p>

	<p>Background: The role of non-linguistic factors, such as executive functions, in the reading comprehension process has been analyzed. The present research sought to investigate the relationship between executive functions and reading comprehension. Methods: In an exploratory cross-sectional study, a group of 89 fourth-grade students were evaluated, considering a balanced number of children with and without reading comprehension difficulties. Results: The results indicate that students with reading comprehension difficulties present a lowered profile with respect to both executive functions and reading variables. The path analysis indicates the presence of differences in the variables that explain reading comprehension for both groups. While in the case of students without reading comprehension difficulties, working memory has both a direct and an indirect effect, i.e., through vocabulary, on reading comprehension; in the case of children with reading comprehension difficulties, only cognitive flexibility has a direct impact. In both cases, inhibition has an indirect impact through vocabulary. Conclusions: We reflect on the differentiated role of executive functions according to the level of development of reading skills, highlighting the possibility that some skills may act in a compensatory manner in the presence of general difficulties. The role of vocabulary in the relationship between executive skills and reading is highlighted.</p>

                Background The selling of Jamu Gendong (an Indonesian traditional herbal medicine), is closely associated with the informal work of women who migrate to different regions. In Sukoharjo Regency and Wonogiri Regency, Central Java Province, the pressing need to meet household necessities in their places of origin compels women to assume the role of breadwinners. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the livelihood capital and resilience of migrant women selling jamu gendong. Methods The study was conducted in Ciamis Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia, in November 2022, using quantitative and qualitative methods. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample comprised 51 women selected through snowball sampling and actively involved in selling Jamu Gendong, along with six key individuals from relevant agencies. Results The research findings indicate that the households of migrant women who sell jamu gendong can survive and adapt during their migration to prevent poverty by implementing diverse livelihood strategies. They are the only ones who move without their family members renting a place to live with them. This research has identified various capital sources, including productive age and skills in preparing jamu gendong; physical capital, including road infrastructure, markets, and access to health and education facilities; and natural, social, and financial capital. This research provides an in-depth understanding of women’s roles in family economic resilience, diversification of life strategies, the importance of social capital in migrant networks, economic empowerment through migration, and the influence of cultural values on livelihood strategies. Conclusions The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the resilience demonstrated by migrant women selling jamu gendong. However, further research should be conducted in areas beyond the city center to obtain a holistic view of their resilience.

                Low-stakes assessments (LSAs) are widely used in medical education to promote continuous learning by providing formative feedback and minimizing the high-stress environment associated with high-stakes assessments. While LSAs are recognized for their role in supporting student learning, questions remain about their reliability and validity. This scoping review aims to systematically identify and synthesize existing literature on the reliability and validity of LSAs within medical education contexts. This study aims to map the methodologies used to establish psychometric parameters, identify problems, and offer best practices. The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, encompassing a comprehensive search across six academic databases and grey literature to identify relevant studies published from 2000 onward. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data, using the Covidence tool for systematic screening and data extraction. Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide an overview of reliability and validity evidence for LSAs in medical education. Insights into motivational and psychometric theories, such as Self-Determination Theory, Classical Test Theory, and Generalizability Theory, that inform LSA design and implementation will be used to analyse the findings in this review. Expected outcomes include a detailed map of the literature on LSA reliability and validity, identification of key challenges, theoretical underpinnings and recommended strategies for improving LSA practices in medical education. Findings will inform future research and provide guidelines for optimizing the use of LSAs to enhance student learning outcomes, assessment integrity, and the educational experience in medical training.

                <p>Social status and dominance are critical factors influencing well-being and survival across multiple species. However, dominance behaviors vary widely across species, from elaborate feather displays in birds to aggression in chimps. To effectively study dominance, it is essential to clearly define and reliably measure dominance behaviors. In laboratory settings, C57BL/6 mice are commonly used to study dominance due to their stable and linear social hierarchies. However, other mouse strains are also used for laboratory research. Despite substantial evidence for strain effects on behavioral repertoires, the impact of strain on dominance in mice remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we compared dominance behaviors between CD1 and C57BL/6 male mice across four assays: observation of agonistic behaviors, urine marking, tube test, and a reward competition. We found that CD1 mice demonstrate increased fighting, increased territorial marking through urination, and increased pushing and resisting in the tube test. We used unsupervised machine learning and pose estimation data from the reward competitions to uncover behavioral differences across strains and across rank differences between competing pairs. Of the four assays, urine marking and agonistic behaviors showed the strongest correlation with dominance in both strains. Most notably, we found that CD1 dominance rankings based on the tube test negatively correlated with rankings from all three other assays, suggesting that the tube test may measure a different behavior in CD1 mice. Our results highlight that behaviors can be strain-specific in mice and studies that measure social rank should consider assays carefully to promote reproducibility.</p>

                The co-infection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) and hydatid disease is rare. Diagnosis and treatment of this co-infection may be challenging as both diseases present with overlapping clinical manifestations, especially in war zones where the health system is destroyed. We are reporting a 45-year-old female police officer transferred to Sinnar Sudan due to ongoing conflict. She was admitted with chronic cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The preliminary diagnosis of pulmonary TB was made based on chest X-ray examination and sputum analysis. Further imaging showed cystic lesions in both the liver and the lungs, and thus a diagnosis of Echinococcosis was made. Surgical intervention was done successfully followed by the courses of Albendazole and anti-TB medication. The clinical condition of the patient improved, with the disappearance of all symptoms. This case represents the diagnostic dilemma of dual infections in the areas of their endemicity because of the symptomatology overlap that might occur and result in an erroneous diagnosis. It does demand an appropriate diagnostic approach, thus, with advanced imaging applications, and once more, emphasizes the interdisciplinary attitude in its treatment for the best possible result.

                Nigeria is located south of the Sahara and is confronted with rapid desertification, with severe impacts in northern Nigeria with signs of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southward of Nigeria. Therefore, this study assessed the rate of desert encroachment and atmospheric warming southwards in Nigeria. The climate of Imo State was studied using Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET)data. The climatic variables studied were annual rainfall, maximum and minimum annual temperatures. The mean temperature was computed from the temperature data. Data from the 30-year period from 1987 to 2016 were used. The annual rainfall and temperature data were divided into three decades, from 1987 to 1996, 1997 to 2006, and 2007 to 2016, to study the variation in decades. Mean monthly variations were also studied. Land features were also assessed. Desert encroachment was assessed in the study area using the criteria for the evaluation of desertification status proposed by the FAO/UNEP (1984). The results revealed that annual rainfall in Owerri was highest in the first decade, with a mean of 2,526.2 mm and the lowest in the third decade, with a mean of 2,278.66 mm. This shows a drop in annual rainfall as the years progressed. The results also reveal that the annual rainfall totals in Imo State are reducing by 13.50 mm annually, indicating desert encroachment as evidenced in loss of vegetation and erosion menace. According to the FAO/UNEP (1984) rating of desertification, desert encroachment in the study area is rated as ‘moderate.’ The maximum temperature shows a mean of 32 °C for the first decade, 32.5 °C for the second decade, and 32.5 °C for the third decade. The mean annual temperature of Owerri was found to increase by 0.02 ° °C per annum. This shows the atmospheric warming of Imo State.

                Background Given the high prevalence of tobacco use, India presents a significant challenge in tobacco control. Yet, the support received for tobacco cessation is suboptimal. Hence, the aim of this narrative review was to identify and heuristically evaluate ‘high-quality’ and ‘engaging’ tobacco cessation mobile apps using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Also, to categorize and analyse their features with respect to engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. Methods A systematic search of tobacco cessation apps was done within app stores of prominent smartphone platforms developed by Apple and Android. The following search terms: ‘quit smoking,’ ‘smoking cessation, ‘stop smoking,’ ‘smoking therapy,’ ‘quit tobacco,’ ‘cigarette cessation,’ ‘cold turkey,’ and ‘quit cigarette.’ Pearson’s correlations were used to analyse correlations between app scores (Total score app-quality/mean score) and downloads/ratings and number of downloads with the overall MARS score. A Chi-square test was performed to analyse any association between app focus and app release dates. Results Total MARS scores ranged from 3.1 to 4.9. Quitsure app (4.9), Craving to Quit! app (4.8) and Stop Tobacco Mobile Trainer: Quit Smoking App (4.74) were ranked the highest according to the MARS overall mean score. Older apps focussed more on mere goal setting or substance use, as compared to behaviour change; whereas, recently developed apps are now focussing more on behaviour change. Conclusions The content and functionality of behaviour change-focused apps were of higher quality than those of other app categories. These recently developed mHealth apps can effectively supersede the traditional smoking cessation methods.

                This article explores the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. In recent years, the demand for healthier and safer products from consumers has been continuously increasing owing to the influence of the geographical indication of agricultural products. Geographical indication products, a type of label that associates food with specific regions, occupy a certain position in the global food market. This article aims to answer research questions about the determinants of the consumption of geographical indication agricultural products and provide a comparative analysis of five literature reviews related to this topic. We collected and processed relevant research data through a systematic literature review and provided transparent, complete, and accurate explanations using the PRISMA criterion. The research results reveal the consumer response to the geographical indication of agricultural products and the determining factors of different responses. The research in this article is of great significance for understanding the consumption trends and important information of geographical indication of agricultural products, helping enterprises better understand consumer behavior, and improving the income of farmers, producers, and enterprises.

                Background A novel modality of cancer treatment based on exposure to non-contact electric fields has been developed to reduce cancer incidence. However, the safety of the electric field exposure was not fully investigated. Therefore, This study aimed to observe the safety of electric field exposure on kidney and liver structures. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into one control group and three treatment groups. Animals were treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene for mammary tumour induction and exposed to non-contact electric fields individually for 10 hours a day for three weeks. Fresh samples of the kidney and liver were collected for observation of structural damage in both organs. Both organs were prepared for histopathological cross-sectioning using the paraffin method and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining followed by histological scoring using the post-examination masking method. Results Damages found in the kidney were as follows: thickening of the Bowman capsule, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, cloudy swelling, epithelial sloughing, inflammation, haemorrhage, and congestion. In addition, the number of inflammation and haemorrhage in the kidney structure of healthy rats that were exposed to electric fields was significantly lower than that in the control group. All damages to the kidneys were also found in the liver, but each showed a different degree of damage. Exposure to this electric field can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, but not to rats with breast cancer. Conclusions Exposure to non-contact electric fields can cause haemorrhagic damage to the livers of healthy rats, however, in other liver tissues and the kidneys, exposure to this electric field was safe. It can even decrease the number of inflammations and haemorrhages in the kidneys.

                Background There have been significant changes in the lifestyles of individuals in the past few decades, which has led to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Both smoking and chewing forms of tobacco are highly prevalent, especially in India, and are implicated as causes of diseases, including oropharyngeal carcinomas. Effective tobacco cessation techniques and sources can help overcome addiction and reduce the disease burden in society. The aim was to evaluate the quality and readability of contents of various sources on an internet website about tobacco cessation. Objectives i) To evaluate the readability of internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests and the quality of internet content (Google) by using the JAMA benchmark, HONcode and DISCERN questionnaire. Methods A content review was employed to screen the content of the Google search engine for educational tobacco cessation websites, and the top 50 websites were selected according to criteria and reviewed by two reviewers. The readability of the internet content (Google) regarding tobacco cessation was evaluated using Flesch–Kincaid readability tests. The quality of the screened sites was evaluated by using the JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) benchmark, HONcode (The Health on the Net Code of Conduct) and DISCERN (Discerning the Quality of Information for Choosing Treatments) questionnaire, and the readability and quality of the screened websites were correlated using the above instruments. Results FK readability ease was found to be 49% standard and 30% easy. The FK grade test found that 33% of the content could be easily understood by < 5th grade. All 4 JAMA benchmarks were met by 23% of websites, and authorship was the least fulfilled criterion. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between FK ease score and FK grade score. Conclusions The Read-ability Ease and Read-ability Grade Levels of the websites related to tobacco cessation were not standard, and few websites fulfilled the JAMA benchmarks and had HONcode certification.

                <p>by Shuanger Li, Davorka Gulisija, Oana Carja</p>

Coexistence of multiple strains of a pathogen in a host population can present significant challenges to vaccine development or treatment efficacy. Here we discuss a novel mechanism that can increase rates of long-lived strain polymorphism, rooted in the presence of social structure in a host population. We show that social preference of interaction, in conjunction with differences in immunity between host subgroups, can exert varying selection pressure on pathogen strains, creating a balancing mechanism that supports stable viral coexistence, independent of other known mechanisms. We use population genetic models to study rates of pathogen heterozygosity as a function of population size, host population composition, mutant strain fitness differences and host social preferences of interaction. We also show that even small periodic epochs of host population stratification can lead to elevated strain coexistence. These results are robust to varying social preferences of interaction, overall differences in strain fitnesses, and spatial heterogeneity in host population composition. Our results highlight the role of host population social stratification in increasing rates of pathogen strain diversity, with effects that should be considered when designing policies or treatments with a long-term view of curbing pathogen evolution.

                <p>by Anush Devadhasan, Oren Kolodny, Oana Carja</p>

Many evolving ecosystems have spatial structures that can be conceptualized as networks, with nodes representing individuals or homogeneous subpopulations and links the patterns of spread between them. Prior models of evolution on networks do not take ecological niche differences and eco-evolutionary interplay into account. Here, we combine a resource competition model with evolutionary graph theory to study how heterogeneous topological structure shapes evolutionary dynamics under global frequency-dependent ecological interactions. We find that the addition of ecological competition for resources can produce a reversal of roles between amplifier and suppressor networks for deleterious mutants entering the population. We show that this effect is a nonlinear function of ecological niche overlap and discuss intuition for the observed dynamics using simulations and analytical approximations. We use these theoretical results together with spatial representations from imaging data to show that, for ductal carcinoma, where tumor growth is highly spatially constrained, with cells confined to a tree-like network of ducts, the topological structure can lead to higher rates of deleterious mutant hitchhiking with metabolic driver mutations, compared to tumors characterized by different spatial topologies.

CD74 is a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which regulates transcription in naïve B and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the regulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and is characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, making this tumor a good candidate for immunotherapy. The tumor and immune cells in TNBC express high levels of CD74; however, the function of this receptor in the tumor environment has not been extensively characterized. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells) tol-DCs (were previously shown to attenuate the antitumor immune response in TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that CD74 enhances tumor growth by inducing the expansion of tumor-infiltrating tol-DCs and Bregs. Utilizing CD74-KO mice, Cre-flox mice lacking CD74 in CD23<sup>+</sup> mature B cells, mice lacking CD74 in the CD11c<sup>+</sup> population, and a CD74 inhibitor (DRQ), we elucidate the mechanism by which CD74 inhibits antitumor immunity. MIF secreted from the tumor cells activates CD74 expressed on DCs. This activation induces the binding of CD74-ICD to the SP1 promotor, resulting in the up-regulation of SP1 expression. SP1 binds the IL-1β promotor, leading to the down-regulation of its transcription. The reduced levels of IL-1β lead to decreased antitumor activity by allowing expansion of the tol-DC, which induces the expansion of the Breg population, supporting the cross-talk between these 2 populations. Taken together, these results suggest that CD74<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs are the dominant cell type involved in the regulation of TNBC progression. These findings indicate that CD74 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.

<p>BLA-projecting NBM cholinergic neurons contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences in both rodents and primates. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of these neurons have also been conserved. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Clusters of the two cell types were easily distinguishable on both unsupervised (UMAP) and supervised (LDA) representations of their electromorphic profiles.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cholinergic projection neurons of the nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI) densely innervate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and have been shown to contribute to the encoding of fundamental and life-threatening experiences. Given the vital importance of these circuits in the acquisition and retention of memories that are essential for survival in a changing environment, it is not surprising that the basic anatomical organization of the NBM/SI is well conserved across animal classes as diverse as teleost and mammal. What is not known is the extent to which the physiology and morphology of NBM/SI neurons have also been conserved. To address this issue, we made patch-clamp recordings from NBM/SI neurons in ex vivo slices of two widely divergent mammalian species, mouse and rhesus macaque, focusing our efforts on cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA. We then reconstructed most of these recorded neurons post hoc to characterize neuronal morphology. We found that rhesus macaque BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons were both more intrinsically excitable and less morphologically compact than their mouse homologs. Combining measurements of 18 physiological features and 13 morphological features, we illustrate the extent of the separation. Although macaque and mouse neurons both exhibited considerable within-group diversity and overlapped with each other on multiple individual metrics, a combined morphoelectric analysis demonstrates that they form two distinct neuronal classes. Given the shared purpose of the circuits in which these neurons participate, this finding raises questions about (and offers constraints on) how these distinct classes result in similar behavior.</p>

                Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished in intensity, the virus continues to circulate globally. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, making it important for the development of treatments against future variants of the virus. In this work, Peruvian natural compounds were evaluated against different mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Methods In silico techniques such as virtual screening, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, and energy estimation analysis were applied. Results Of the tested compounds by virtual screening, rutin was identified as the best binding agent against the different proposed Mpro mutations. In addition, computational simulations and energy estimation analysis demonstrated the high structural and energetic stability between the Mpro-rutin systems. Conclusions Overall, our study identified rutin as the most promising compound with a strong affinity for various Mpro mutations, potentially playing a key role in the development of new treatments for emerging viral variants.

                Background The provision of effective musculoskeletal physiotherapy and treatment outcomes are challenged by the shortage of resources, limitations in adherence to clinical guidelines, and client unacceptability. This study aims to evaluate the process quality of musculoskeletal physiotherapy service in the physiotherapy department of Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Ethiopia, 2020. Method This is a health facility-based single-embedded case study design that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the service using a three dimensions assessment for quality service evaluation (compliance of the unit, technical compliance, and service acceptability). The quantitative data was collected through document review and observation of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, direct observations of 20 client-physiotherapist interactions, and chart review on systematically selected 172 client charts. For qualitative data; in-depth interviews with five Key informants and 21 clients were conducted. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS v.25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was done and data were presented using frequency and percentage. The calculated outputs were used to judge the overall service against the predetermined criteria (i.e. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor). Results The compliance of the musculoskeletal physiotherapy unit, service providers’ technical compliance, and service acceptability by the users were judged poor (56.1%), fair (60.1%), and good (73.1%) respectively. The compliance of physiotherapists in recording patient information was concerningly poor (30.2%). The majority of clients were satisfied with the service and adhered to their treatment. Conclusion & recommendation The overall service process quality of physiotherapy service was judged as fair (62.55%). However, the assessed dimensions were not as per the expected standard. Therefore, the relevant stakeholders are recommended to improve the service provision gaps.

<p>Cross-sectional study of the first consecutive 200 PNP and 1,100 NNP patients evaluated at a Neuro-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinic between May 2020 and March 2023. Patients were divided into younger (18–44 years), middle-age (45–64 years), and older (65+ years) age groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals accounted for 142 of 200 (71%) of PNP and 995 of 1100 (90.5%) of NNP patients. Significant age-related differences in the frequencies of comorbidities and abnormal neurologic findings demonstrated higher prevalence in older patients. Conversely, 10 months from COVID-19 onset, we found significant age-related differences in Neuro-PASC symptoms indicating lower prevalence, and therefore, symptom burden, in older individuals. Moreover, there were significant age-related differences in subjective impression of fatigue (median [interquartile range (IQR)] patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] score: younger 64 [57–69], middle-age 63 [57–68], older 60.5 [50.8–68.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.04) and sleep disturbance (median [IQR] PROMIS score: younger 57 [51–63], middle-age 56 [53–63], older 54 [46.8–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.002) in the NNP group, commensurate with higher impairment in quality of life (QoL) among younger patients. Finally, there were significant age-related differences in objective executive function (median [IQR] National Institutes of Health [NIH] toolbox score: younger 48 [35–63], middle-age 49 [38–63], older 54.5 [45–66.3]; <i>p</i> = 0.01), and working memory (median [IQR] NIH toolbox score: younger 47 [40–53], middle-age 50 [44–57], older 48 [43–58]; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) in NNP patients, with the worst performance coming from the younger group.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Younger and middle-age individuals are disproportionally affected by Neuro-PASC regardless of acute COVID-19 severity. Although older people more frequently have abnormal neurologic findings and comorbidities, younger and middle-age patients suffer from a higher burden of Neuro-PASC symptoms and cognitive dysfunction contributing to decreased QoL. Neuro-PASC principally affects adults in their prime, contributing to profound public health and socioeconomic impacts warranting dedicated resources for prevention, diagnosis and interventions.

They identify a secondary volume increase (SVI) in normal-like cells via cytoskeleton-mediated NHE1 activation. SVI is absent in cancer cells and on compliant substrates. This leads to nucleus deformation, transcriptomic changes, and ERK-dependent growth inhibition.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96582">The sperm hook as a functional adaptation for migration and self-organized behavior</a></h4>

              
                In most murine species, spermatozoa exhibit a falciform apical hook at the head end. The function of the sperm hook is not yet clearly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of the sperm hook in the migration of spermatozoa through the female reproductive tract in <i>Mus musculus</i> (C57BL/6), using a deep tissue imaging custom-built two-photon microscope. Through live reproductive tract imaging, we found evidence indicating that the sperm hook aids in the attachment of spermatozoa to the epithelium and facilitates interactions between spermatozoa and the epithelium during migration in the uterus and oviduct. We also observed synchronized sperm beating, which resulted from the spontaneous unidirectional rearrangement of spermatozoa in the uterus. Based on live imaging of spermatozoa-epithelium interaction dynamics, we propose that the sperm hook plays a crucial role in successful migration through the female reproductive tract by providing anchor-like mechanical support and facilitating interactions between spermatozoa and the female reproductive tract in the house mouse.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87083">Switching of RNA splicing regulators in immature neuroblasts during adult neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The lateral wall of the mouse subventricular zone harbors neural stem cells (NSC, B cells) which generate proliferating transient-amplifying progenitors (TAP, C cells) that ultimately give rise to neuroblasts (NB, A cells). Molecular profiling at the single-cell level struggles to distinguish these different cell types. Here, we combined transcriptome analyses of FACS-sorted cells and single-cell RNAseq to demonstrate the existence of an abundant, clonogenic and multipotent population of immature neuroblasts (iNB cells) at the transition between TAP and migrating NB (mNB). iNB are reversibly engaged in neuronal differentiation. Indeed, they keep molecular features of both undifferentiated progenitors, plasticity and unexpected regenerative properties. Strikingly, they undergo important progressive molecular switches, including changes in the expression of splicing regulators leading to their differentiation in mNB subdividing them into two subtypes, iNB1 and iNB2. Due to their plastic properties, iNB could represent a new target for regenerative therapy of brain damage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96353">Spatiotemporal recruitment of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP8 directs endosome maturation</a></h4>

              
                The spatiotemporal transition of small GTPase Rab5 to Rab7 is crucial for early-to-late endosome maturation, yet the precise mechanism governing Rab5-to-Rab7 switching remains elusive. USP8, a ubiquitin-specific protease, plays a prominent role in the endosomal sorting of a wide range of transmembrane receptors and is a promising target in cancer therapy. Here, we identified that USP8 is recruited to Rab5-positive carriers by Rabex5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5. The recruitment of USP8 dissociates Rabex5 from early endosomes (EEs) and meanwhile promotes the recruitment of the Rab7 GEF SAND-1/Mon1. In USP8-deficient cells, the level of active Rab5 is increased, while the Rab7 signal is decreased. As a result, enlarged EEs with abundant intraluminal vesicles accumulate and digestive lysosomes are rudimentary. Together, our results reveal an important and unexpected role of a deubiquitinating enzyme in endosome maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98716">Spatial and temporal coordination of Duox/TrpA1/Dh31 and IMD pathways is required for the efficient elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine of Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Multiple gut antimicrobial mechanisms are coordinated in space and time to efficiently fight foodborne pathogens. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) together with intestinal cell renewal play a key role in eliminating gut microbes. A complementary mechanism would be to isolate and treat pathogenic bacteria while allowing colonization by commensals. Using real-time imaging to follow the fate of ingested bacteria, we demonstrate that while commensal <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> freely circulate within the intestinal lumen, pathogenic strains such as <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> or <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, are blocked in the anterior midgut where they are rapidly eliminated by antimicrobial peptides. This sequestration of pathogenic bacteria in the anterior midgut requires the Duox enzyme in enterocytes, and both TrpA1 and Dh31 in enteroendocrine cells. Supplementing larval food with hCGRP, the human homolog of Dh31, is sufficient to block the bacteria, suggesting the existence of a conserved mechanism. While the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is essential for eliminating the trapped bacteria, it is dispensable for the blockage. Genetic manipulations impairing bacterial compartmentalization result in abnormal colonization of posterior midgut regions by pathogenic bacteria. Despite a functional IMD pathway, this ectopic colonization leads to bacterial proliferation and larval death, demonstrating the critical role of bacteria anterior sequestration in larval defense. Our study reveals a temporal orchestration during which pathogenic bacteria, but not innocuous, are confined in the anterior part of the midgut in which they are eliminated in an IMD-pathway-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94689">Automated workflow for the cell cycle analysis of (non-)adherent cells using a machine learning approach</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI(CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97665">T-follicular helper cells are epigenetically poised to transdifferentiate into T-regulatory type 1 cells</a></h4>

              
                Chronic antigenic stimulation can trigger the formation of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing T-regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells in vivo. We have recently shown that murine T-follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single-cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T-cells, we find that most of these genes, including <i>Il10</i>, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated, and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4, and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.

">Neural Encoding of Semantic StructuresDuring Sentence Production</a></h4>

              
                The neural representations for compositional processing have so far been mostly studied during sentence comprehension. In an fMRI study of sentence production, we investigated the brain representations for compositional processing during speaking. We used a rapid serial visual presentation sentence recall paradigm to elicit sentence production from the conceptual memory of an event. With voxel-wise encoding models, we probed the specificity of the compositional structure built during the production of each sentence, comparing an unstructured model of word meaning without relational information with a model that encodes abstract thematic relations and a model encoding event-specific relational structure. Whole-brain analyses revealed that sentence meaning at different levels of specificity was encoded in a large left fronto-parieto-temporal network. A comparison with semantic structures composed during the comprehension of the same sentences showed similarly distributed brain activity patterns. An ROI analysis over left fronto-temporal language parcels showed that event-specific relational structure above word-specific information was encoded in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Overall, we found evidence for the encoding of semantic meaning during sentence production in a distributed brain network and for the encoding event-specific semantic structures in the LIFG.

">Ethanol alters mechanosensory habituation in C. elegans by way of the BK potassium channel through a novel mechanism</a></h4>

              
                In this research, we investigated how alcohol modulates the simplest form of learning, habituation, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We used our high throughput Multi-Worm Tracker to conduct a large scale study of more than 21,000 wild-type worms to assess the effects of different doses of alcohol on habituation of the well-characterized tap withdrawal response. We found that the effect of alcohol on habituation of the reversal response to repeated mechanosensory stimuli (taps) differed depending on the component of the reversal response assessed. Furthermore, we discovered that alcohol shifted the dominant response to tap from a backward reversal to a brief forward movement. Because the large conductance potassium (BK) channel has been shown to be important for alcohol's effects on behaviour in a variety of organisms, including C. elegans, we investigated whether the C. elegans BK channel ortholog, SLO-1, mediated the effects of alcohol on habituation. We tested several different strains of worms with mutations in slo-1 along with wild-type controls; null mutations in slo-1 made animals resistant to alcohol induced changes in learning. However, a mutation in the putative ethanol binding site on SLO-1 did not disrupt ethanol's impact on habituation. Finally, by degrading SLO-1 in different parts of the nervous system we found that SLO-1s function in ethanol's impact on habituation is likely distributed throughout the neural circuit that responds to tap. Based on these results, our main conclusions are 1) ethanol is not a general facilitator or inhibitor of habituation but rather a complex modulator, 2) SLO-1 is required for ethanol's effect on habituation, 3) ethanol is interacting (directly or indirectly) with SLO-1 through a novel unidentified mechanism to influence response plasticity.

">Assessing changes in whole-brain structural connectivity in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's Disease using diffusion imaging and tractography</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial, progressive neurodegenerative disease that has a profound impact on those it afflicts. Its hallmark pathophysiology is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain which trigger a host of motor and non-motor symptoms. Many preclinical research efforts utilize unilateral lesion models to assess the neural mechanisms of PD and explore new therapeutic approaches because these models produce similar motor symptoms to those of PD patients. The goal of this work is to examine changes in brain structure resulting from a unilateral lesion both within the nigrostriatal system, where dopaminergic neurons are lost, and throughout the brain. Using multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and correlational tractography, we assessed microstructural changes throughout the brain resulting from unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the median forebrain bundle (MFB). Following lesioning, the PD phenotype was confirmed using behavioral and histological assessment. Correlational tractography found networks of fiber tracts that were either positively or negatively correlated with lesion status throughout the brain. Analyzing patterns of intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity between the positively and negatively correlated fiber tracts revealed two separate neural networks. The first contained only negatively correlated fibers in the lesioned hemisphere consistent with the local effects of the lesion (i.e. dopaminergic depletion in the nigrostriatal system). The second contained systematically overlapping fiber tracts in the lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres including the olfactory system and cerebellum, which we suggest are indicative of adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the lesion. Taken together, these results suggest that correlational tractography is a reasonable tool to examine whole brain structural changes in rodent models of neurodegenerative disease, and may have future translational value as a diagnostic tool for patients with PD.

">Neuronal heterogeneity of normalization strength in a circuit model</a></h4>

              
                The size of a neuron's receptive field increases along the visual hierarchy. Neurons in higher-order visual areas integrate information through a canonical computation called normalization, where neurons respond sublinearly to multiple stimuli in the receptive field. Neurons in the visual cortex exhibit highly heterogeneous degrees of normalization. Recent population recordings from visual cortex find that the interactions between neurons, measured by spike count correlations, depend on their normalization strengths. However, the circuit mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of normalization is unclear. In this work, we study normalization in a spiking neuron network model of visual cortex. The model produces a range of neuronal heterogeneity of normalization strength and the heterogeneity is highly correlated with the inhibitory current each neuron receives. Our model reproduces the dependence of spike count correlations on normalization as observed in experimental data, which is explained by the covariance with the inhibitory current. We find that neurons with stronger normalization are more sensitive to contrast differences in images and encode information more efficiently. In addition, networks with more heterogeneity in normalization encode more information about visual stimuli. Together, our model provides a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous normalization strengths in the visual cortex, and sheds new light on the computational benefits of neuronal heterogeneity.

">Sex-specific perturbations of neuronal development caused by mutations in the autism risk gene DDX3X</a></h4>

              
                DDX3X is an X-linked RNA helicases that escapes X chromosome inactivation and is expressed at higher levels in female brains. Mutations in DDX3X are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are predominantly identified in females. Using cellular and mouse models, we show that Ddx3x mediates sexual dimorphisms in brain development at a molecular, cellular, and behavioral level. During cortical neuronal development, Ddx3x sustains a female-biased signature of enhanced ribosomal biogenesis and mRNA translation. Female neurons display higher levels of ribosomal proteins and larger nucleoli, and these sex dimorphisms are obliterated by Ddx3x loss. Ddx3x regulates dendritic outgrowth in a sex- and dose-dependent manner in both female and male neurons, and dendritic spine development only in female neurons. Further, ablating Ddx3x conditionally in forebrain neurons is sufficient to yield sex-specific changes in developmental outcomes and motor function. Together, these findings pose Ddx3x as a mediator of sexual differentiation during neurodevelopment and open new avenues to understand sex differences in health and disease.

">Electrical synapse molecular diversity revealed by proximity-based proteomic discovery</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal circuits are composed of synapses that are either chemical, where signals are transmitted via neurotransmitter release and reception, or electrical, where signals pass directly through interneuronal gap junction channels. While the molecular complexity that controls chemical synapse structure and function is well appreciated, the proteins of electrical synapses beyond the gap-junction-forming Connexins are not well defined. Yet, electrical synapses are expected to be molecularly complex beyond the gap junctions. Connexins are integral membrane proteins requiring vesicular transport and membrane insertion/retrieval to achieve function, homeostasis, and plasticity. Additionally, electron microscopy of neuronal gap junctions reveals neighboring electron dense regions termed the electrical synapse density (ESD). To reveal the molecular complexity of the electrical synapse proteome, we used proximity-dependent biotinylation (TurboID) linked to neural Connexins in zebrafish. Proteomic analysis of developing and mature nervous systems identifies hundreds of Connexin-associated proteins, with overlapping and distinct representation during development and adulthood. The identified protein classes span cell adhesion molecules, cytoplasmic scaffolds, vesicular trafficking, and proteins usually associated with the post synaptic density (PSD) of chemical synapses. Using circuits with stereotyped electrical and chemical synapses, we define molecular sub-synaptic compartments of ESD localizing proteins, we find molecular heterogeneity amongst electrical synapse populations, and we examine the synaptic intermingling of electrical and chemical synapse proteins. Taken together, these results reveal a new complexity of electrical synapse molecular diversity and highlight a novel overlap between chemical and electrical synapse proteomes. Moreover, human homologs of the electrical synapse proteins are associated with autism, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders, providing a novel framework towards understanding neuro-atypical states.

">Visual and auditory object representations in ventral visual cortex after restoring sight in humans</a></h4>

              
                Visual category-selective representations in human ventral occipital temporal cortex (VOTC) seem to emerge early in infancy. Surprisingly, the VOTC of congenitally blind humans features category-selectivity for auditory and haptic objects. Yet it has been unknown whether VOTC would show category-selective visual responses if sight were restored in congenitally blind humans. Assuming competition for synaptic space during development, cross-modal activation of VOTC as a consequence of congenital blindness might interfere with visual processing in sight-recovery individuals. To test this hypothesis, we investigated adults who had suffered a transient phase of congenital blindness due to bilateral dense cataracts before their sight was restored by cataract-removal surgery. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants watched movies of faces, scenes, body parts and other objects in the visual condition, while in the auditory condition they listened to the corresponding sounds. The most prominent group difference was the reduced face-selectivity in individuals with reversed congenital cataracts compared to age- and sex-matched normally-sighted individuals. In addition, a double dissociation was found: only sight-recovery individuals demonstrated significant decoding accuracy of visual categories based on auditory category representations in VOTC, while only normally-sighted individuals' VOTC decoded auditory categories based on visual category representations. The present results uncovered the neural mechanisms of previously observed face processing impairments in individuals with reversed congenital blindness. We suggest that lower face-selectivity in the sight recovery group might arise from selective deficits in the cortical representation of the central visual field in lower-tier visual areas. Additionally, we speculate that in higher-order visual areas cross-modal activity might facilitate - rather than interfere - with visual functional recovery after congenital blindness.

">Transcallosal generation of phase aligned beta-bursts underlies TMS-induced interhemispheric inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background The excitability of the sensorimotor (SM1) cortices is reflected in the bilateral ~20 Hz beta oscillations. The extent to which these oscillations subtend the interhemispheric inhibition captured by the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) ipsilateral Silent Period (iSP) protocol is unknown. Objectives We investigated the relationship between movement-induced beta suppression, iSP, and manual dexterity. Methods Forty adults underwent an Electroencephalography assessment of beta oscillations during volitional left hand movement and a TMS assessment of iSP recorded from the right hand. In both cases, left SM1 beta oscillations (contralateral to the activated right SM1), were monitored through a proxy signal - the Electromyography of the contracted right hand. Manual dexterity was assessed with the Purdue Pegboard Test. Results Volitional movement caused significant bilateral SM1 beta suppression in nearly all participants (85 %). ISPs were observed in every participant. In the proxy signal for the left SM1, the iSP coincides with TMS-induced high-amplitude beta bursts. These bursts showed significant phase alignment across participants 10-70 ms after the TMS pulse. There was no significant association between the left-/right-hemisphere beta suppression, iSP, and manual dexterity. Conclusion Our results highlight the distinct nature of beta oscillation changes during voluntary movement compared to TMS-iSP and show that TMS induces IHI via transcallosal induction of phase aligned beta bursts. Furthermore, our data suggests that only the initial phase of a beta burst carries an inhibitory effect. It also highlights the possibility of evoking a beta burst with the iSP protocol, opening perspectives for future modeling studies.

">Decoding Motivational States and Craving through Electrical Markers for Neural 'Mind Reading'</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this electroencephalogram (EEG) study was to identify electrical neuro-markers of 12 different motivational and physiological states such as visceral craves, affective and somatosensory states, and secondary needs. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 30 right-handed participants while recalling a specific state upon the presentation of an auditory verbal command incorporating an evocative sound background consistent with that state (e.g. the chirping of cicadas associated with the verbal complaint about feeling hot). ERP data showed larger amplitude N400 responses in the affective and somatosensory states, while the P400 component displayed greater amplitudes for the secondary and visceral states. Furthermore, the two components were also discernibly responsive to the 12 micro-categories (e.g., joy vs. pain or hunger), by providing a distinctive electric pattern for mostly all microstates. The reconstruction of the intracranial generators of surface signals revealed common imagery-related activations, including the middle and superior frontal gyri, the fusiform and lingual gyri, supramarginal, and middle occipital regions, as well as the middle temporal region. Additionally, specific regions were identified that were active for distinct mentally represented content, such as that visceral needs were associated with activations in the medial and inferior frontal gyri, uncus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus. Affective states were associated with activations in the medial frontal, superior temporal, and middle temporal gyri. Somatosensory states (e.g., pain or cold) activated regions in the parietal cortex and the crave for music was linked to activations in the auditory and motor regions. These findings support the use of ERP markers for BCI applications.

                Chemotaxis to a potential mate who is moving and emitting a volatile sex pheromone poses a navigation challenge that requires rapid, precise responses to maximize reproductive success. We demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans males address this challenge by utilizing two pheromone detectors located in head and tail sensory neurons. Despite sharing a receptor SRD-1, AWA head neurons promote forward movement and acceleration, while tail PHD neurons induce reversals and deceleration. In increasing pheromone gradients AWA dominates; whereas weakening gradients inactivate AWAs, allowing PHDs to fine-tune the response and correct the path. Head AWAs are essential for mate-searching, while tail PHDs are crucial for complex tasks. The navigation mode and velocity adapt as males climb a pheromone gradient. A minimal-parameter computational model recapitulates key findings and illuminates the interplay between head and tail signals in adaptive navigation.

                Higher-Order Interaction (HOI) theory offers a powerful framework for capturing complex, non-linear relationships within multidimensional systems, moving beyond traditional pairwise graph methods to encompass multi-way interactions. This study applies HOI analysis, specifically using hypergraph theory, to explore intricate connectivity patterns in electrophysiological signals from neuroscience. Hypergraphs were constructed from connectivity data across various frequency bands, characterized through metrics such as spectral entropy, hyperedge centrality, and vertex centrality, and compared using spectral and centrality distance measures. Three distinct neurophysiological datasets were analyzed: intracranial EEG signals from rats during different sleep stages, scalp EEG data to distinguish between epilepsy types, and MEG recordings of seizure dynamics. The findings highlight the effectiveness of hypergraph-based HOI analysis in mapping neural dynamics across normal and pathological brain states. In sleep studies, it reveals distinct connectivity patterns between REM and NREM stages, while in epilepsy, it differentiates seizure types and stages, identifying spectral entropy as a potential marker for seizure onset. Notably, HOI analysis captures differences between primary and secondary generalized epilepsy, suggesting enhanced diagnostic accuracy. This approach provides a powerful tool for understanding complex neural interactions in high-dimensional data.

">Effects of sex, mating status, and genetic background on circadian behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in regulating behavior, physiology, and health. Sexual dimorphism, a widespread phenomenon across species, influences circadian behaviors. Additionally, post-mating physiological changes in females are known to modulate various behaviors, yet their effects on circadian rhythms remain underexplored. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful model for studying circadian mechanisms, we systematically assessed the impact of sex and mating status on circadian behavior. We measured circadian period length and rhythm strength in virgin and mated males and females, including females mated to males lacking Sex Peptide (SP), a key mediator of post-mating changes. Across four wild-type and control strains, we found that males consistently exhibited shorter circadian periods than females, regardless of mating status, suggesting that circadian period length is a robust sexually dimorphic trait. In contrast, rhythm strength was influenced by the interaction between sex and mating status, with female mating generally reducing rhythm strength in the presence of SP signaling. Notably, genetic background significantly modulated these effects on rhythm strength. Our findings demonstrate that while circadian period length is a stable sex-specific trait, rhythm strength is shaped by a complex interplay between sex, mating status, and genetic background. This study advances our understanding of how sex and mating influence circadian rhythms in Drosophila and provides a foundation for future research into sexually dimorphic mechanisms underlying human diseases associated with circadian disruptions.

">Brain-Cognitive Gaps in relation to Dopamine and Health-related Factors: Insights from AI-Driven Functional Connectome Predictions</a></h4>

              
                A key question in human neuroscience is to understand how individual differences in brain function are related to cognitive differences. However, the optimal condition of brain function to study between-person differences in cognition remains unclear. Additionally, there is a lack of objective biomarkers to accurately predict cognitive function, with brain age emerging as a potential candidate. Recent research suggests that brain age offers minimal additional information on cognitive decline beyond what chronological age provides, prompting a shift toward approaches focused directly on cognitive prediction. Using a novel deep learning approach, we evaluated the predictive power of the functional connectome during various states (resting state, movie-watching, and n-back) on episodic memory and working memory performance. Our findings show that while task-based connectomes, especially during movie watching, better predict working memory, resting state connectomes are equally effective in predicting episodic memory. Furthermore, individuals with a negative brain-cognition gap (where brain predictions underestimate actual performance) exhibited lower physical activity, lower education, and higher cardiovascular risk compared to those with a positive gap. This shows that knowledge of the brain-cognition gap provides insights into factors contributing to cognitive resilience. Further lower PET-derived measures of dopamine binding were linked to a greater brain-cognition gap, mediated by regional functional variability. Together, our study introduces the brain-cognitive gap, as a new marker, modulated by the dopamine system, to identify individuals at risk of compromised brain function.

	<p>Background: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as an effective treatment for managing chronic pain that is unresponsive to traditional therapies. While SCS is well documented for conditions like failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), its effectiveness in managing pain related to spinal cord injuries (SCI) is less studied. This study aims to assess the efficacy of SCS in alleviating SCI-related pain and improving patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, filling a gap in the existing literature. Methods: This cohort study included 15 adult patients with traumatic and non-traumatic SCIs, treated between 2016 and 2022. Patients received SCS implants after either a trial or direct implantation. Pain levels were assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores, while quality of life was evaluated using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) scale. The SCS devices were implanted at different spinal levels, with various stimulation protocols applied, including high-frequency stimulation (10 kHz). Results: In patients with traumatic SCI, the mean VAS score decreased from 8.6 to 4.5, with 71% reporting more than 50% pain relief. Non-traumatic SCI patients experienced a reduction from 8.5 to 2.5, with all showing more than 50% pain relief. EQ-5D scores improved in both groups. A 49% reduction in pain medication usage was also observed, though one patient required revision surgery due to an adverse event. Conclusions: SCS significantly reduces pain and improves quality of life for SCI patients, particularly with high-frequency protocols. While promising, further research is needed to optimize patient selection and stimulation parameters for better long-term outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: As a form of visual input, bodily expressions can be maintained and manipulated in visual working memory (VWM) over a short period of time. While the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an indispensable role in top-down control, it remains largely unclear whether this region also modulates the VWM storage of bodily expressions during a delay period. Therefore, the two primary goals of this study were to examine whether the emotional bodies would elicit heightened brain activity among areas such as the PFC and extrastriate body area (EBA) and whether the emotional effects subsequently modulate the functional connectivity patterns for active maintenance during delay periods. Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants performed a delayed-response task in which they were instructed to view and maintain a body stimulus in working memory before emotion categorization (happiness, anger, and neutral). If processing happy and angry bodies consume increased cognitive demands, stronger PFC activation and its functional connectivity with perceptual areas would be observed. Results: Results based on univariate and multivariate analyses conducted on the data collected during stimulus presentation revealed an enhanced processing of the left PFC and left EBA. Importantly, subsequent functional connectivity analyses performed on delayed-period data using a psychophysiological interaction model indicated that functional connectivity between the PFC and EBA increases for happy and angry bodies compared to neutral bodies. Conclusions: The emotion-modulated coupling between the PFC and EBA during maintenance deepens our understanding of the functional organization underlying the VWM processing of bodily information.</p>

	<p>Creativity and the production of artwork can have an impact on the course and treatment of comorbid severe mental illness and neurodegeneration. We report on a 70-year-old male patient with highly original artistic behavior, who suffered from lifelong recurrent major depression and subsequently developed symptoms of progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). In the context of a systematic literature review, we detail the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s personal and artistic biographies and portray artwork from his artistic portfolio together with his disease history, clinical examination, psychopathological and neuropsychological evaluations, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, neuroimaging, neurophysiological testing, and psychotherapeutic treatment. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s 1&amp;amp;ndash;2-year history of primarily bulbar motor symptoms and signs aligned with electromyography, showing widespread signs of continuing denervation/chronic neurogenic changes. Slight impairments in semantic fluency, executive control, and visuoconstructive abilities were observed in neuropsychological testing, in conjunction with right-sided medial temporal lobe atrophy in an MRI. He was prescribed medication, including extended-release venlafaxine, trazodone, pramipexole, and zolpidem, and took his medication regularly, usually at high doses. For most of his life, the patient had attributed professional &amp;amp;ldquo;success&amp;amp;rdquo; and artistic output to, at times, excessive alcohol consumption. Later, however, his interest in creative work continued despite alcohol reduction and cessation. Psychotherapy grounded him in reality via goal-centered behaviors, making him realize that his physical and mental ailments rather hindered his creative output. In summary, creative behavior can be utilized in the treatment of patients with psychiatric conditions (affective or addictive disorders) and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In the reported case, specific psychopharmacology and psychotherapy that address goal-directed self-efficacy experiences of reality were critical to the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: The link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and the complexity of their differential diagnosis has been vastly investigated. Growing attention has been paid to the presence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in autistic individuals. Studies assessing OCD traits in autistic individuals are scarce and even less take into account the role that this overlap may have on the development and maintenance of PIU. We aimed to investigate OCD features in ASD individuals and their association with autism severity and the prevalence of PIU, and the potential dimensions associated with a greater probability of PIU. Methods: a total of 46 participants with ASD and 53 controls were assessed with the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum questionnaire and the Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Spectrum&amp;amp;mdash;Short Version. Results: There were significantly higher OCD features in ASD participants along with important correlations between OCD and ASD dimensions and a higher prevalence of PIU in the ASD group. Participants with putative PIU reported greater scores on some ASD and OCD dimensions, the with Doubt and Non-verbal communication domains emerging as significant predictors of the presence of putative PIU. Conclusions: These results support the three-way link between ASD, OCD, and PIU, contributing to the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental basis for those conditions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prematurely born individuals are at risk for developing socio-emotional difficulties and psychopathologies such as autism spectrum disorder. Particular difficulties processing social information conveyed by the face may underlie these vulnerabilities. Methods: This comprehensive review provides an overview of 27 studies published between 2000 and mid-2022 concerning face processing in individuals born preterm and/or born with low birth weight across different age ranges, paradigms, and outcome measures. The results were interpreted across different developmental stages. Results: Behavioural studies indicated that prematurity is associated with poorer facial identity and expression processing compared to term-born controls, especially for negative emotions. Structural alterations and delayed maturation in key neural face processing structures could explain these findings. Neuroimaging also revealed functional atypicalities, which may either be rooted in the structural alterations or may partly compensate for the delayed maturation. Conclusions: The results suggest that altered face processing may be associated with an increased risk of developing psychopathologies in individuals born prematurely. Future studies should investigate the preterm behavioural phenotype and the potential need for face processing rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Objectives: The present open-label multicenter pilot study sought to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of rimegepant in treating migraine attacks. Methods: The primary endpoint was pain freedom at two hours post-dose, while the co-primary efficacy endpoints included a reduction in the headache intensity and freedom from the most bothersome symptoms (MBS) associated with migraine at the same time point. To test the potential efficacy of rimegepant, patients were asked to record in a questionnaire all the relevant changes with each migraine attack treated with rimegepant at two hours post-dose vs. two hours before. The attending neurologists provided information on the basic demographics, medical anamnesis, and migraine history as well as the triptan use history. Results: A total of 54 patients (32 with episodic and 22 with chronic migraine) received rimegepant 75 mg at least once during a single migraine attack (overall, 140 dosage intakes). Pain freedom at 2 h was achieved in 45/140 (32.1%) intakes. Regarding the efficacy of the first rimegepant dose (n = 54), significant reductions in the headache intensity were observed between the pre- and 2 h post-treatment average VAS scores (&amp;amp;minus;4.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8 mean; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, the same mean reductions in the average VAS scores occurred when the 2 h response to all 140 doses was analyzed (&amp;amp;minus;5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.8; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Freedom from MBS at 2 h post-dose was achieved for photophobia in 43%, for phonophobia in 53%, and for nausea in 57%. The ability to fully return to everyday activities at 2 h post-dose was achieved in 83/140 instances (59%). We only recorded mild adverse events in 24/140 dosages. Conclusions: Our preliminary results demonstrate that rimegepant is effective, safe, and well tolerated in treating acute migraine attacks.</p>

	<p>Background: Educational professionals face significant challenges in determining the most appropriate educational placement for each child with ASD, which is a major concern for their parents. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors in the development of students with ASD (language development, cognitive development, and socio-emotional development) that are most relevant in determining the modalities of schooling in early childhood education. Methods: A total of 381 Psychopedagogical Evaluation Reports from students with ASD aged 3 to 5 years were reviewed. The importance of each variable was identified using artificial neural network analysis. Classification trees were used to determine their distribution in the two schooling modalities. Results: A total of 42.9% of boys aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD and 54.12% of girls aged 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 years with ASD were enrolled in specific modalities. Conclusions: Cognitive development and comprehensive language were the two variables that best explained whether children with ASD were educated in specific or ordinary modalities. The presence of a significantly impaired level of cognitive development was the best predictor of schooling in specific modalities, and for the rest of the cognitive levels, the greater the difficulties in comprehensive language, the greater the likelihood of schooling in specific modalities.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies have shown that emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) multimodal physiological signals exhibits superior performance compared to that of unimodal approaches. Nonetheless, there remains a paucity of in-depth investigations analyzing the inherent relationship between EEG and fNIRS and constructing brain networks to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Methods: In this study, we introduce an innovative method to construct hybrid brain networks in the source space based on simultaneous EEG-fNIRS signals for emotion recognition. Specifically, we perform source localization on EEG signals to derive the EEG source signals. Subsequently, causal brain networks are established in the source space by analyzing the Granger causality between the EEG source signals, while coupled brain networks in the source space are formed by assessing the coupling strength between the EEG source signals and the fNIRS signals. The resultant causal brain networks and coupled brain networks are integrated to create hybrid brain networks in the source space, which serve as features for emotion recognition. Results: The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated on multiple emotion datasets. The experimental results indicate that the recognition performance of our approach significantly surpasses that of the baseline method. Conclusions: This work offers a novel perspective on the fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals in an emotion-evoked experimental paradigm and provides a feasible solution for enhancing emotion recognition performance.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Patients with non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP) exhibit sensorimotor disturbances, with proprioception impairment considered an important aspect. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a novel inertial sensor-based electrogoniometer (KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg;) for cervical spine (CS) proprioception measurement in patients with NSCNP. Methods: The within-day intra-rater reliability of CS proprioception and its association with patient demographics and clinical status were examined in fifty-nine patients with NSCNP, aged between 25&amp;amp;ndash;65 years, recruited from primary care. CS proprioception was examined via angle reproduction, in angles set mid-range in the available CS range of motion (ROM) in each motion direction. The clinical status evaluation comprised the maximum and average pain intensity in the last week, disability, fear of movement/re-injury, catastrophizing, neck awareness, and CS-ROM. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of the measurement (SEM), and minimum detectable change (MDC95%). Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s R assessed between-measures associations. Results: CS proprioception reliability was good (ICC2,1 = 0.75&amp;amp;ndash;0.89), with low measurement error (SEM = 1.38&amp;amp;ndash;3.02&amp;amp;deg; and MDC95% = 3.83&amp;amp;ndash;8.38&amp;amp;deg;). Correlations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; CS proprioception and their clinical status or demographics were not significant. Conclusions: The reliability of CS proprioception assessment with the KFORCE Sens&amp;amp;reg; was good in a sample of mildly to moderately disabled patients with CNP and thus deemed suitable for further research in this field.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-265/v2?src=rss">Ambient Air Pollution and Chronic kidney disease risk in Deltan communities: A Policy Brief, 2023 [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                Background The impact and changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis affect the patient’s fulfilment and quality of life. Objective This study aims to thoroughly investigate the experiences of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This research uses a qualitative descriptive approach with in-depth interview methods. Participants numbered 15 people from Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital and Hasanuddin University Hospital, which were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Result There are three themes produced in this research: 1) various responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) various impacts, and 3) coping mechanisms developed. Conclusion These findings indicate that patients with end-stage renal disease who undergo hemodialysis have attempted to build adaptive coping strategies in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they still need support from healthcare providers in the hemodialysis unit to overcome various problems and impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hemodialysis nurses are expected to be able to carry out holistic assessments and continuous evaluation in order to provide comprehensive nursing care to meet patient needs for hemodialysis in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1403/v1?src=rss">Mental health status of caregivers of cancer patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The global prevalence of cancer is rapidly increasing, and patients often require ancillary non-clinical care during treatment. Caregivers, in turn, experience several mental health challenges as they fulfil their responsibilities. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among caregivers of cancer patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar; and explore the psychosocial factors contributing to their mental health. Methods For objective 1, a cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data from 230 caregivers accompanying cancer patients who attended a tertiary care hospital in Bhubaneswar, Odisha during February-April 2024. A licensed version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to evaluate the levels of anxiety and depression, while the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used to assess stress. For objective 2, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers, then recorded, transcribed and translated for thematic analysis. Results The prevalence of anxiety, depression and perceived stress among caregivers was found to be 45.2%, 43.4% and 44.8%, respectively. ‘Being the sole caregiver’ was identified as a significant predictor of caregivers’ mental health, affecting levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Further, qualitative analysis identified factors like social support, financial hardships, emotional toll, personal wellbeing, communication with healthcare provider and transportation as key contributors to caregivers’ mental health decline. Conclusion Caregivers of cancer patients face significant mental health challenges that need focused attention. Integrating informal social networks, counselling services, creating support groups and offering financial assistance into cancer care programs can help address their needs.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <p>Neuroinflammation can lead to chronic maladaptive pain affecting millions of people worldwide. Neurotransmitters, cytokines, and ion channels are implicated in neuroimmune cell signaling, but their roles in specific behavioral responses are not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in skin controls rapid and transient heat hypersensitivity induced by intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin via IL-1a cytokine signaling. Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are not, however, involved in mechanical hypersensitivity that developed in the i.d. capsaicin animal model. Here, we show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels are also critical for heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. complete Freund adjuvant (CFA). i.d. CFA, a model of chronic neuroinflammation, involves ongoing cytokine signaling for days leading to pronounced edema and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli. Peripheral Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity in the skin was required for the full development and week-long time course of heat hypersensitivity induced by i.d. CFA, but paw edema and mechanical hypersensitivity were independent of Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. CFA induced increases in several cytokines in hindpaw fluid including IL-6 which was also dependent on Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity. Using IL-6&ndash;specific neutralizing antibodies in vivo, we show that IL-6 contributes to heat hypersensitivity and that neutralizing both IL-1a and IL-6 was even more effective at reducing the magnitude and duration of CFA-induced heat hypersensitivity. Our findings demonstrate a functional link between Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channel activity and the release of IL-6 in the skin and show that Ca<SUB>V</SUB>2.2 channels have a privileged role in the induction and maintenance of heat hypersensitivity during chronic forms of neuroinflammation in the skin.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach is considered as one of the minimally invasive interventions. The success of restoration depends on various clinical factors like material, patient and operator factor. Conjoint analysis is a technique for measuring individual’s preference structures via systematical variations of products attributes in an experimental design. Aim Assess Pedodontists’ perception of non-clinical factors and investigate influence of child’s age, level of cooperation and vulnerability status on their decisions to perform Atraumatic Restorative Approach (ART) approach using hypothetical patient scenario’s and conjoint design. Materials and methods A cross-sectional exploratory survey using a web-based questionnaire was performed among Pedodontists registered as life members under Indian Association of Pedodontic and Preventive Dentistry. Self-designed structured scenario-based questionnaire was prepared and validated. Three non-clinical factors Age of child, Cooperation level and Vulnerability status were considered. Using orthogonal design, SPSS software nine profiles were created randomly along with two holdouts. Final study proforma consisted of three sections with description of eleven clinical scenarios. It was administered to participants using Google forms. Using SPSS conjoint software relative utilities for each factor on decision for using ART was estimated. Results Four hundred and thirty-two pedodontists had completed the survey (35.9%). Pedodontists considered vulnerability status of the child as the most important factor for their decision to use ART treatment. For the vulnerability status, the factor vulnerable had the greatest utility (-0.364) compared to non-vulnerable factor (0.364). For cooperation level, factor uncooperative had greater utility (-0.343), as compared to moderately cooperative (0.066) and uncooperative (0.277). For the age factor, the age of 4 years had the greatest utility (-0.175) compared with age 6 (-0.013) and age 12 (0.19). Conclusion The most preferred scenario by pedodontists to consider ART as treatment of choice was child belonging to vulnerable section, being very young and uncooperative.

                Consumer satisfaction is an outcome of business marketing activities, bridging the buying and usage phases with subsequent consequences such as attitude changes, recurring purchases, and brand loyalty. Most studies have utilized variations of the disconfirmation paradigm, which posits that satisfaction is influenced by the degree and type of disconfirmation experienced and initial expectations. Despite the importance of satisfaction, there remains a paucity of evidence on the cause and effect leading to expectation-confirmation and disconfirmation paradigm. This paper explores the reasons and the key factors in the perspectives of the relevant literature and aims to identify the intention of confirmation and disconfirmation in satisfaction theories. This conceptual paper also suggests various critical analyses based on the arguments for and against the paradigm in customer satisfaction. Consequently, the paper seeks to examine existing gaps in the literature regarding customer satisfaction theories for business sustainability and decision making, which may need to be more concise in the satisfaction generation process.

                Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly morbid disease. Chemotherapy for NSCLC lacks specificity and efficacy mainly because of drug resistance. The current study aimed to explore computational tools to target allosteric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sites and screen for the top molecules in vitro and in vivo xenograft models. Methods Molecular docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamic studies revealed that acenocoumarol and silodosin are the top two allosteric EGFR inhibitors. They were further tested for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, and gene expression by qPCR, western blotting, A549 cell xenograft anti-proliferative activity, and tumor regression efficacy analysis. Results Acenocoumarol and silodosin exhibited cytotoxicity in A549 and IMR-90 cells at concentrations below 50 and 80 μM, respectively. Acenocoumarol and silodosin induced S-phase and G2/M-phase arrest in A549 cells in the cell cycle analysis. Both drugs showed early apoptosis at their IC50 doses (acenocoumarol 50 μM and silodosin 25 μM). KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) gene regulation in A549 cells was confirmed using qPCR. KRAS and ERK2 activities were quantified by western blot analysis. In the xenograft study, tumor size, body weight, and organ weight were significantly attenuated by the test drugs compared with the standard cisplatin. Immunoblotting and western blot results of the A549-xenograft tissue indicated downregulation of KRAS and ERK2. Furthermore, the test drugs have upregulated caspase-3 gene expression. Conclusion The drugs acenocoumarol and silodosin downregulate KRAS and ERK2 both in cell line and in Xenograft model. KRAS and ERK2 are associated with EGFR inhibition. Hence, acenocoumarol and silodosin can be further explored for repurposing studies in human trials.

Measles is an important infectious disease system both for its burden on public health and as an opportunity for studying nonlinear spatio-temporal disease dynamics. Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions <i>a priori</i>, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems.

We combine an off-lattice agent-based mathematical model and experimentation to explore filamentous growth of a yeast colony. Under environmental stress, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> yeast cells can transition from a bipolar (sated) to unipolar (pseudohyphal) budding mechanism, where cells elongate and bud end-to-end. This budding asymmetry yields spatially non-uniform growth, where filaments extend away from the colony centre, foraging for food. We use approximate Bayesian computation to quantify how individual cell budding mechanisms give rise to spatial patterns observed in experiments. We apply this method of parameter inference to experimental images of colonies of two strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in low and high nutrient environments. The colony size at the transition from sated to pseudohyphal growth, and a forking mechanism for pseudohyphal cell proliferation are the key features driving colony morphology. Simulations run with the most likely inferred parameters produce colony morphologies that closely resemble experimental results.

                <p>by Yaoda Xu</p>

The key to adaptive visual processing lies in the ability to maintain goal-directed visual representation in the face of distraction. In visual working memory (VWM), distraction may come from the coding of distractors or other concurrently retained targets. This fMRI study reveals a common representational geometry that our brain uses to combat both types of distractions in VWM. Specifically, using fMRI pattern decoding, the human posterior parietal cortex is shown to orthogonalize the representations of different streams of information concurrently coded in VWM, whether they are targets and distractors, or different targets concurrently held in VWM. The latter is also seen in the human occipitotemporal cortex. Such a representational geometry provides an elegant and simple solution to enable independent information readout, effectively combating distraction from the different streams of information, while accommodating their concurrent representations. This representational scheme differs from mechanisms that actively suppress or block the encoding of distractors to reduce interference. It is likely a general neural representational principle that supports our ability to represent information beyond VWM in other situations where multiple streams of visual information are tracked and processed simultaneously.

                <p>by Román Zapién-Campos, Florence Bansept, Arne Traulsen</p>

How can we figure out how the different microbes interact within microbiomes? To combine theoretical models and experimental data, we often fit a deterministic model for the mean dynamics of a system to averaged data. However, in the averaging procedure a lot of information from the data is lost—and a deterministic model may be a poor representation of a stochastic reality. Here, we develop an inference method for microbiomes based on the idea that both the experiment and the model are stochastic. Starting from a stochastic model, we derive dynamical equations not only for the average, but also for higher statistical moments of the microbial abundances. We use these equations to infer distributions of the interaction parameters that best describe the biological experimental data—improving identifiability and precision. The inferred distributions allow us to make predictions but also to distinguish between fairly certain parameters and those for which the available experimental data does not give sufficient information. Compared to related approaches, we derive expressions that also work for the relative abundance of microbes, enabling us to use conventional metagenome data, and account for cases where not a single host, but only replicate hosts, can be tracked over time.

                <p>by Cécile Courret, Lucas W. Hemmer, Xiaolu Wei, Prachi D. Patel, Bryce J. Chabot, Nicholas J. Fuda, Xuewen Geng, Ching-Ho Chang, Barbara G. Mellone, Amanda M. Larracuente</p>

Centromeres reside in rapidly evolving, repeat-rich genomic regions, despite their essential function in chromosome segregation. Across organisms, centromeres are rich in selfish genetic elements such as transposable elements and satellite DNAs that can bias their transmission through meiosis. However, these elements still need to cooperate at some level and contribute to, or avoid interfering with, centromere function. To gain insight into the balance between conflict and cooperation at centromeric DNA, we take advantage of the close evolutionary relationships within the <i>Drosophila simulans</i> clade—<i>D</i>. <i>simulans</i>, <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, and <i>D</i>. <i>mauritiana—</i>and their relative, <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i>. Using chromatin profiling combined with high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization on stretched chromatin fibers, we characterize all centromeres across these species. We discovered dramatic centromere reorganization involving recurrent shifts between retroelements and satellite DNAs over short evolutionary timescales. We also reveal the recent origin (<240 Kya) of telocentric chromosomes in <i>D</i>. <i>sechellia</i>, where the X and fourth centromeres now sit on telomere-specific retroelements. Finally, the Y chromosome centromeres, which are the only chromosomes that do not experience female meiosis, do not show dynamic cycling between satDNA and TEs. The patterns of rapid centromere turnover in these species are consistent with genetic conflicts in the female germline and have implications for centromeric DNA function and karyotype evolution. Regardless of the evolutionary forces driving this turnover, the rapid reorganization of centromeric sequences over short evolutionary timescales highlights their potential as hotspots for evolutionary innovation.

                <p>by Anantu Sunil, Olivia Pedroncini, Andreas T. Schaefer, Tobias Ackels</p>

Odors are transported by seemingly chaotic plumes, whose spatiotemporal structure contains rich information about space, with olfaction serving as a gateway for obtaining and processing this spatial information. Beyond tracking odors, olfaction provides localization and chemical communication cues for detecting conspecifics and predators, and linking external environments to internal cognitive maps. In this Essay, we discuss recent physiological, behavioral, and methodological advancements in mammalian olfactory research to present our current understanding of how olfaction can be used to navigate the environment. We also examine potential neural mechanisms that might convert dynamic olfactory inputs into environmental maps along this axis. Finally, we consider technological applications of odor dynamics for developing bio-inspired sensor technologies, robotics, and computational models. By shedding light on the principles underlying the processing of odor dynamics, olfactory research will pave the way for innovative solutions that bridge the gap between biology and technology, enriching our understanding of the natural world.

                <p>Mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) result in CSF1R-related disorder (CSF1R-RD). Our previous study demonstrated a proteolytic generation of a soluble CSF1R (sCSF1R) that could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker of CSF1R-RD. Herein, we observed that sCSF1R is released into peripheral serum as a highly glycosylated monomer in <i>Csf1r</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mice that mimic the clinical symptoms of CSF1R-RD patients. Notably, we found that serum sCSF1R could distinguish CSF1R-RD cohorts from controls with high accuracy as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This study demonstrates that reduced sCSF1R in serum may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for CSF1R-RD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Many antidiabetic medications with distinct modes of action are available, The sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are among the most recent oral antihyperglycemic medications. The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin, a biguanide medication, as the first option for oral control of type 2 diabetes because it has demonstrated promise in this regard. Aim of the study To evaluate and compare the effects of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors on general urine parameters in T2DM patients from Iraq. Method a prospective cohort study where 101 adult patients of both sexes aged under 70 years and newly diagnosed with T2DM, patients were divided into two groups, Metformin group (n=52), where metformin was prescribed as monotherapy by the clinician and SGLT-2 inhibitors group (n=49) where either dapagliflozin or empagliflozin were prescribed by the clinician, general urine examination was done for each patient in the first contact and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results The mean age was 57±9 years for the metformin group and 54±9 years for the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. There was no significant difference in leukocytes, erythrocytes, or epithelial cell counts between the metformin group and the SGLT2 inhibitor group before and after 12 weeks of treatment. There was a significant difference (p-value =0.043) in leukocytes and a non-significant difference in erythrocytes and epithelial cell counts before and after treatment in the SGLT-2 inhibitors group. Conclusions Diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors treatment demonstrated higher leukocyte count than metformin group patients, an indicator and predictor for higher susceptibility to urinary tract infections.

                Background The zoonotic infection caused by tapeworms Echinococcus is a neglected tropical disease in poor regions with limited access to suitable sanitary conditions. Hydatid cysts produced by Echinococcus granulosus use fatty-acid-binding proteins (FABP) to obtain the fatty acids and cholesterol necessary for their survival from the host. In this work, we analyzed the behaviour of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids against EgFABP1. Methods We used computational biology and chemistry techniques and binding free energy estimations by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA). Results This research has enabled us to clarify the EgFABP1 isoforms identified in the database, suggesting their potential involvement in diverse cellular activities of Echinococcus granulosus. Conversely, examining the global and local chemical reactivity of 14 fatty acids revealed that liposolubility is contingent upon the degree of unsaturation in the FAs. Additionally, FAs exhibited acceptable levels of oral absorption and bioavailability. The binding of EgFABP1 with FAs analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation showed us that these are highly stable, where the best affinity was with docosahexaenoic acid. Conclusions Our results suggest that the action of fatty acids could play an interesting role in detecting early Echinococcus granulosus.

                Neurodegenerative disorders represent a leading cause of disability among the elderly population, and Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent. Emerging evidence suggests a frequent co-occurrence of circadian disruption and PD. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear: is circadian disruption a cause, consequence, or a parallel feature of the disease that shares the same root cause? This review seeks to address this question by highlighting and discussing clinical evidence and findings from experiments using vertebrate and invertebrate animal models. While research on causality is still in its early stages, the available data suggest reciprocal interactions between PD progression and circadian disruption.

                The algorithm of the prefrontal working memory system on sequence memory tasks is not well understood, whereas it is well understood for the hippocampal episodic memory system. This work shows a mathematical duality between working and episodic sequence memory. This leads to a computational understanding of sequence working memory—as structured activity slots. This theory algorithmically explains recurrent neural network (RNN) and prefrontal representations during sequence memory tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96953">The actomyosin system is essential for the integrity of the endosomal system in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                The actin cytoskeleton is a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic cells, yet its complexity varies across different taxa. In the parasitic protist <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, a rudimentary actomyosin system consisting of one actin gene and two myosin genes has been retained despite significant investment in the microtubule cytoskeleton. The functions of this highly simplified actomyosin system remain unclear, but appear to centre on the endomembrane system. Here, advanced light and electron microscopy imaging techniques, together with biochemical and biophysical assays, were used to explore the relationship between the actomyosin and endomembrane systems. The class I myosin (TbMyo1) had a large cytosolic pool and its ability to translocate actin filaments in vitro was shown here for the first time. TbMyo1 exhibited strong association with the endosomal system and was additionally found on glycosomes. At the endosomal membranes, TbMyo1 colocalised with markers for early and late endosomes (TbRab5A and TbRab7, respectively), but not with the marker associated with recycling endosomes (TbRab11). Actin and myosin were simultaneously visualised for the first time in trypanosomes using an anti-actin chromobody. Disruption of the actomyosin system using the actin-depolymerising drug latrunculin A resulted in a delocalisation of both the actin chromobody signal and an endosomal marker, and was accompanied by a specific loss of endosomal structure. This suggests that the actomyosin system is required for maintaining endosomal integrity in <i>T. brucei</i>.

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease, the pathophysiology and genetic basis of which are incompletely understood. Using a forward genetic screen in multiplex families with SLE, we identified an association between SLE and compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i>. Experimental blockade of ACK1 or BRK increased circulating autoantibodies in vivo in mice and exacerbated glomerular IgG deposits in an SLE mouse model. Mechanistically, NRTKs regulate activation, migration, and proliferation of immune cells. We found that the patients’ <i>ACK1</i> and <i>BRK</i> variants impair efferocytosis, the MERTK-mediated anti-inflammatory response to apoptotic cells, in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived macrophages, which may contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Overall, our data suggest that ACK1 and BRK deficiencies are associated with human SLE and impair efferocytosis in macrophages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99303">Sequential replacement of PSD95 subunits in postsynaptic supercomplexes is slowest in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                The concept that dimeric protein complexes in synapses can sequentially replace their subunits has been a cornerstone of Francis Crick’s 1984 hypothesis, explaining how long-term memories could be maintained in the face of short protein lifetimes. However, it is unknown whether the subunits of protein complexes that mediate memory are sequentially replaced in the brain and if this process is linked to protein lifetime. We address these issues by focusing on supercomplexes assembled by the abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95, which plays a crucial role in memory. We used single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy and MINFLUX to probe the molecular composition of PSD95 supercomplexes in mice carrying genetically encoded HaloTags, eGFP, and mEoS2. We found a population of PSD95-containing supercomplexes comprised of two copies of PSD95, with a dominant 12.7 nm separation. Time-stamping of PSD95 subunits in vivo revealed that each PSD95 subunit was sequentially replaced over days and weeks. Comparison of brain regions showed subunit replacement was slowest in the cortex, where PSD95 protein lifetime is longest. Our findings reveal that protein supercomplexes within the postsynaptic density can be maintained by gradual replacement of individual subunits providing a mechanism for stable maintenance of their organization. Moreover, we extend Crick’s model by suggesting that synapses with slow subunit replacement of protein supercomplexes and long-protein lifetimes are specialized for long-term memory storage and that these synapses are highly enriched in superficial layers of the cortex where long-term memories are stored.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91648">Genetic requirement of dact1/2 to regulate noncanonical Wnt signaling and calpain 8 during embryonic convergent extension and craniofacial morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Wnt signaling plays crucial roles in embryonic patterning including the regulation of convergent extension (CE) during gastrulation, the establishment of the dorsal axis, and later, craniofacial morphogenesis. Further, Wnt signaling is a crucial regulator of craniofacial morphogenesis. The adapter proteins Dact1 and Dact2 modulate the Wnt signaling pathway through binding to Disheveled. However, the distinct relative functions of Dact1 and Dact2 during embryogenesis remain unclear. We found that <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> genes have dynamic spatiotemporal expression domains that are reciprocal to one another suggesting distinct functions during zebrafish embryogenesis. Both <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> contribute to axis extension, with compound mutants exhibiting a similar CE defect and craniofacial phenotype to the <i>wnt11f2</i> mutant. Utilizing single-cell RNAseq and an established noncanonical Wnt pathway mutant with a shortened axis (<i>gpc4</i>), we identified <i>dact1/2</i>-specific roles during early development. Comparative whole transcriptome analysis between wildtype and <i>gpc4</i> and wildtype and <i>dact1/2</i> compound mutants revealed a novel role for <i>dact1/2</i> in regulating the mRNA expression of the classical calpain <i>capn8</i>. Overexpression of <i>capn8</i> phenocopies <i>dact1/2</i> craniofacial dysmorphology. These results identify a previously unappreciated role of <i>capn8</i> and calcium-dependent proteolysis during embryogenesis. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinct and overlapping roles of <i>dact1</i> and <i>dact2</i> in embryonic craniofacial development, providing new insights into the multifaceted regulation of Wnt signaling.

	<p>This paper presents the basis for LoGlo PDT, a new treatment for glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is currently treated with maximal safe resection, temozolomide, and ionizing irradiation. Mortality in 2024 remains over 80% within several years from diagnosis. Oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an FDA/EMA approved drug that is selectively taken up by malignant cells, including by glioblastoma. In photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma, intense intraoperative light causes glioblastoma tissue that has taken up 5-ALA to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. The requirement for intense light flux has restricted photodynamic treatment to a single one-hour intraoperative session. We analyze here published data showing that external light, illuminating the entire intact scalp, can attain low &amp;amp;mu;W/cm2 flux several cm into intact brain that would be sufficient to mediate 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma if the light and 5-ALA are delivered continuously over 24 h. At the core of LoGlo PDT regimen is the dataset showing that, for a given fluence, as the duration of PDT light delivery goes down, light intensity (flux) delivered must go up to achieve the same glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity as would a weaker light (lower flux) delivered over a longer time. Thus, a repetitive, noninvasive PDT of glioblastoma using an external light source may be possible. We analyze 5-ALA cellular physiology to show that three non-oncology drugs, ciprofloxacin, deferiprone, and telmisartan, can be repurposed to increase light energy capture after 5-ALA, thereby increasing photodynamic treatment&amp;amp;rsquo;s glioblastoma cell cytotoxicity. The LoGlo PDT approach uses both drug augmentation and prolonged ultra-low noninvasive transcranial light delivery for a repetitive, noninvasive 5-ALA photodynamic treatment of glioblastoma.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1% of population over age 60. It is defined by motor and nonmotor symptoms including a spectrum of cognitive impairments known as Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (PDD). Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for PDD is rivastigmine, which inhibits acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase increasing the level of acetylcholine in the brain. Due to its limited efficacy and side effect profile, rivastigmine is often not prescribed, leaving patients with no treatment options. PD has several derangements in neurotransmitter pathways (dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, kynurenine pathway (KP), acetylcholine, &amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) and rivastigmine is only partially effective as it only targets one pathway. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan metabolism, affects the pathophysiology of PDD in multiple ways. Both galantamine (&amp;amp;alpha;7 nicotinic receptor) and memantine (antagonist of the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor) are KYNA modulators. When used in combination, they target multiple pathways. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with each drug alone for PD have failed, the combination of galantamine and memantine has demonstrated a synergistic effect on cognitive enhancement in animal models. It has therapeutic potential that has not been adequately assessed, warranting future randomized controlled trials. In this review, we summarize the KYNA-centric model for PD pathophysiology and discuss how this treatment combination is promising in improving cognitive function in patients with PDD through its action on KYNA.</p>

	<p>Background: Individualizing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) parameters can improve precision in neuropsychiatric disorders. One important decision for the clinician is the selection of an appropriate montage&amp;amp;mdash;conventional or high-definition (HD)&amp;amp;mdash;to implement dose-controlled tDCS while maintaining the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s safety. Method: The present study simulated tDCS administration using T1-weighted brain images of 50 dementia, 25 depression patients, and 25 healthy individuals for two conventional and HD montages, targeting the regions of interest (ROIs) in the dorsal and ventral pathways that support language processing. For each tDCS configuration, the electric fields at the ROIs and the individualized dose required to achieve the desired current intensity at the target ROI across the subjects were estimated. Linear regression was performed on these parameters. Result: A significant relationship between atrophy and current dose that varies according to the disease was found. The dementia patients with significant brain atrophy required a higher personalized dosage for HD montage, as the current intensity at the target ROIs was lower and more variable than that of conventional montage. For dementia, tDCS individualization is pathway-dependent, wherein HD configuration of the dorsal route requires current dosages above the safety limit (&amp;amp;gt;4 mA) for 46% of individuals. However, there was no significant difference in electrode configurations between the HD and traditional setups for depression and healthy volunteers without significant brain atrophy. Conclusions: HD-tDCS with fixed locations is limited, making conventional tDCS more effective for dose-controlled applications. In patients with atrophy, individualized adjustments based on simulations are needed due to the variable stimulation strength in the ROI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e0223242024?rss=1">The Icelandic Mutation (APP-A673T) Is Protective against Amyloid Pathology In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>A previous epidemiological study in Northern Europe showed that the A673T mutation (Icelandic mutation) in the amyloid precursor protein gene (<I>APP</I>) can protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the effect of the A673T mutation on APP processing has been investigated primarily in vitro, its in vivo impact has not been evaluated. This is mainly because most existing AD mouse models carry the Swedish mutation. The Swedish and Icelandic mutations are both located near the &beta;-cleavage site, and each mutation is presumed to have the opposite effect on &beta;-cleavage. Therefore, in the AD mouse models with the Swedish mutation, its effects could compete with the effects of the Icelandic mutation. Here, we introduced the A673T mutation into <I>App</I> knock-in mice devoid of the Swedish mutation (<I>App<sup>G-F</sup></I> mice) to avoid potential deleterious effects of the Swedish mutation and generated <I>App<sup>G-F-A673T</sup></I> mice. APP-A673T significantly downregulated &beta;-cleavage and attenuated the production of A&beta; and amyloid pathology in the brains of these animals. The Icelandic mutation also reduced neuroinflammation and neuritic alterations. Both sexes were studied. This is the first successful demonstration of the protective effect of the Icelandic mutation on amyloid pathology in vivo. Our findings indicate that specific inhibition of the APP-BACE1 interaction could be a promising therapeutic approach. Alternatively, the introduction of the disease-protective mutation such as APP-A673T using in vivo genome editing technology could be a novel treatment for individuals at high risk for AD, such as familial AD gene mutation carriers and <I>APOE</I> 4 carriers.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e0359242024?rss=1">Kernels of Motor Memory Formation: Temporal Generalization in Bimanual Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In daily life, we coordinate both simultaneous and sequential bimanual movements to manipulate objects. Our ability to rapidly account for different object dynamics suggests there are neural mechanisms to quickly deal with them. Here we investigate how actions of one arm can serve as a contextual cue for the other arm and facilitate adaptation. Specifically, we examine the temporal characteristics that underlie motor memory formation and recall, by testing the contextual effects of prior, simultaneous, and post contralateral arm movements in both male and female human participants. To do so, we measure their temporal generalization in three bimanual interference tasks. Importantly, the timing context of the learned action plays a pivotal role in the temporal generalization. While motor memories trained with post adaptation contextual movements generalize broadly, motor memories trained with prior contextual movements exhibit limited generalization, and motor memories trained with simultaneous contextual movements do not generalize to prior or post contextual timings. This highlights temporal tuning in sensorimotor plasticity: different training conditions yield substantially different temporal generalization characteristics. Since these generalizations extend far beyond any variability in training times, we suggest that the observed differences may stem from inherent differences in the use of prior, current, and post adaptation contextual information in the generation of natural behavior. This would imply differences in the underlying neural circuitry involved in learning and executing the corresponding coordinated bimanual movements.</p>

                <p>Merkel cell&ndash;neurite complexes (MNCs) are enriched in touch-sensitive areas, including whisker hair follicles and the glabrous skin of the rodent's paws, where tactile stimulation elicits slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) tactile impulses to encode for the sense of touch. Recently, we have shown with rodent whisker hair follicles that SA1 impulses are generated through fast excitatory synaptic transmission at MNCs and driven by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). However, it is currently unknown whether, besides whisker hair follicles, ASICs also play an essential role in generating SA1 impulses from MNCs of other body parts in mammals. In the present study, we attempted to address this question by using the skin&ndash;nerve preparations made from the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerves of both male and female rodents and applying the pressure-clamped single&ndash;fiber recordings. We showed that SA1 impulses elicited by tactile stimulation to the rat hindpaw glabrous skin were largely diminished in the presence of amiloride and diminazene, two ASIC channel blockers. Furthermore, using the hindpaw glabrous skin and tibial nerve preparations made from the mice genetically deleted of ASIC3 channels (ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>), we showed that the frequency of SA1 impulses was significantly lower in ASIC3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice than in littermate wild-type ASIC3<sup>+/+</sup> mice, a result consistent with the pharmacological experiments with ASIC channel blockers. Our findings suggest that ASIC channels are essential for generating SA1 impulses to underlie the sense of touch in the glabrous skin of rodent hindpaws.</p>

                <p>The human auditory cortex is organized according to the timing and spectral characteristics of speech sounds during speech perception. During listening, the posterior superior temporal gyrus is organized according to onset responses, which segment acoustic boundaries in speech, and sustained responses, which further process phonological content. When we speak, the auditory system is actively processing the sound of our own voice to detect and correct speech errors in real time. This manifests in neural recordings as suppression of auditory responses during speech production compared with perception, but whether this differentially affects the onset and sustained temporal profiles is not known. Here, we investigated this question using intracranial EEG recorded from seventeen pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while they performed a reading/listening task. We identified onset and sustained responses to speech in the bilateral auditory cortex and observed a selective suppression of onset responses during speech production. We conclude that onset responses provide a temporal landmark during speech perception that is redundant with forward prediction during speech production and are therefore suppressed. Phonological feature tuning in these "onset suppression" electrodes remained stable between perception and production. Notably, auditory onset responses and phonological feature tuning were present in the posterior insula during both speech perception and production, suggesting an anatomically and functionally separate auditory processing zone that we believe to be involved in multisensory integration during speech perception and feedback control.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1173242024?rss=1">A Dynamic Link between Respiration and Arousal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Viewing brain function through the lens of other physiological processes has critically added to our understanding of human cognition. Further advances though may need a closer look at the interactions between these physiological processes themselves. Here we characterize the interplay of the highly periodic, and metabolically vital respiratory process and fluctuations in arousal neuromodulation, a process classically seen as nonperiodic. In the data from three experiments (<I>N</I> = 56 / 27 / 25 women and men), we tested for covariations in respiratory and pupil size (arousal) dynamics. After substantiating a robust coupling in the largest dataset, we further show that coupling strength decreases during task performance compared with rest and that it mirrors a decreased respiratory rate when participants take deeper breaths. Taken together, these findings suggest a stronger link between respiratory and arousal processes than previously thought. Moreover, these links imply a stronger coupling during periods of rest, and the effect of respiratory rate on the coupling suggests a driving role. As a consequence, studying the role of neuromodulatory arousal on cortical function may also need to consider respiratory influences.</p>

                <p>The primary cilium, a single microtubule-based organelle protruding from the cell surface and critical for neural development, also functions in adult neurons. While some dorsal root ganglion neurons elaborate a primary cilium, whether it is expressed by and functional in nociceptors is unknown. Recent studies have shown the role of Hedgehog, whose canonical signaling is primary cilium dependent, in nociceptor sensitization. We establish the presence of primary cilia in soma of rat nociceptors, where they contribute to mechanical threshold, prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB> (PGE<SUB>2</SUB>)-induced hyperalgesia, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN). Intrathecal administration of siRNA targeting <I>Ift88</I>, a primary cilium-specific intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein required for ciliary integrity, resulted in attenuation of <I>Ift88</I> mRNA and nociceptor primary cilia. Attenuation of primary cilia was associated with an increase in mechanical nociceptive threshold in vivo and decrease in nociceptor excitability in vitro, abrogation of hyperalgesia, and nociceptor sensitization induced by both a prototypical pronociceptive inflammatory mediator PGE<SUB>2</SUB> and paclitaxel CIPN, in a sex-specific fashion. siRNA targeting <I>Ift52</I>, another IFT protein, and knockdown of NompB, the <I>Drosophila Ift88</I> ortholog, also abrogated CIPN and reduced baseline mechanosensitivity, respectively, providing independent confirmation for primary cilia control of nociceptor function. Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia is attenuated by <I>Ift88</I> siRNA, supporting the role for primary cilia in Hedgehog-induced hyperalgesia. Attenuation of CIPN by cyclopamine (intradermal and intraganglion), which inhibits Hedgehog signaling, supports the role of Hedgehog in CIPN. Our findings support the role of the nociceptor primary cilium in control of mechanical nociceptive threshold and inflammatory and neuropathic pain, the latter Hedgehog-dependent.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1353242024?rss=1">Different Subregions of Monkey Lateral Prefrontal Cortex Respond to Abstract Sequences and Their Components</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sequential information permeates daily activities, such as when watching for the correct series of buildings to determine when to get off the bus or train. These sequences include periodicity (the spacing of the buildings), the identity of the stimuli (the kind of house), and higher-order more abstract rules that may not depend on the exact stimulus (e.g., house, house, house, business). Previously, we found that the posterior fundus of area 46 in the monkey lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) responds to rule changes in such abstract visual sequences. However, it is unknown if this region responds to other components of the sequence, i.e., image periodicity and identity, in isolation. Further, it is unknown if this region dissociates from other, more ventral LPFC subregions that have been associated with sequences and their components. To address these questions, we used awake functional magnetic resonance imaging in three male macaque monkeys during two no-report visual tasks. One task contained abstract visual sequences, and the other contained no visual sequences but maintained the same image periodicity and identities. We found the fundus of area 46 responded only to abstract sequence rule violations. In contrast, the ventral bank of area 46 responded to changes in image periodicity and identity, but not changes in the abstract sequence. These results suggest a functional specialization within anatomical substructures of LPFC to signal different kinds of stimulus regularities. This specialization may provide key scaffolding to identify abstract patterns and construct complex models of the world for daily living.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1442242024?rss=1">Glutamine Oxidation in Mouse Dorsal Root Ganglia Regulates Pain Resolution and Chronification</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic pain remains a significant health challenge with limited effective treatments. This study investigates the metabolic changes underlying pain progression and resolution, uncovering a novel compensatory mechanism in sensory neurons. Using the hyperalgesic priming model in male mice, we demonstrate that nerve growth factor (NGF) initially disrupted mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, leading to acute allodynia. Surprisingly, this metabolic disruption persisted even after the apparent resolution of allodynia. We discovered that during the resolution phase, sensory neurons exhibit increased glutamine oxidation and upregulation of the major glutamine transporter ASCT2 in dorsal root ganglia. This compensatory response plays a crucial role in pain resolution, as demonstrated by our experiments. Knockdown of ASCT2 prevents the resolution of NGF-induced allodynia and precipitates the transition to a chronic state. Furthermore, we show that the glutamine catabolite &alpha;-ketoglutarate attenuated glycolytic flux and alleviated allodynia in both acute and chronic phases of the hyperalgesic priming model. The importance of ASCT2 is further confirmed in a translational model, where its knockdown prevented the resolution of allodynia following plantar incision. These findings highlight the pivotal role of metabolic changes in pain resolution and identify ASCT2-mediated glutamine metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain. Understanding these endogenous mechanisms that promote pain resolution can guide the development of novel interventions to prevent the transition pain from acute to chronic.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/47/e1761232024?rss=1">Growth Hormone Receptor in Lateral Hypothalamic Neurons Is Required for Increased Food-Seeking Behavior during Food Restriction in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Growth hormone (GH) action in the brain regulates neuroendocrine axes, energy and glucose homeostasis, and several neurological functions. The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) contains numerous neurons that respond to a systemic GH injection by expressing the phosphorylated STAT5, a GH receptor (GHR) signaling marker. However, the potential role of GHR signaling in the LHA is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that ~70% of orexin- and leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons in the LHA are responsive to GH. Male mice carrying inactivation of the <I>Ghr</I> gene in the LHA were generated via bilateral injections of an adeno-associated virus. In <I>ad libitum</I>-fed mice, GHR ablation in LHA neurons did not significantly change energy and glucose homeostasis. Subsequently, mice were subjected to 5&nbsp;d of 40% food restriction. Food restriction decreased body weight, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate oxidation. These effects were similarly observed in control and LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice. While food-deprived control mice progressively increased ambulatory/exploratory activity and food-seeking behavior, LHA<sup>GHR</sup> mice did not show hyperactivity induced by food restriction. GHR ablation in the LHA reduced the percentage of orexin neurons expressing c-Fos during food restriction. Additionally, an acute GH injection increased the expression of c-Fos in LHA<sup>ORX</sup> neurons. Inactivation of <I>Ghr</I> in LepR-expressing cells did not prevent hyperactivity in food-deprived mice, whereas whole-brain <I>Ghr</I> knock-out mice showed reduced ambulatory activity during food restriction. Our findings indicate that GHR signaling in the LHA regulates the activity of orexin neurons and is necessary to increase food-seeking behavior in food-deprived male mice.</p>
