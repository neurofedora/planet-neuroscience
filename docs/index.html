     alt="Hemispheric cortical atrophy and chronic microglial activation following mild focal ischemic stroke in adult male rats"/>
<p>Localised injection of ET-1 to the motor cortex resulted in focal ischemic damage causing neuronal loss. Despite the asymptomatic nature of this model of stroke, lacking motor or cognitive impairment, chronic inflammation and hemispheric atrophy developed over time. These findings highlight that even mild stroke can result in long-term pathological outcomes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Animal modeling has played an important role in our understanding of the pathobiology of stroke. The vast majority of this research has focused on the acute phase following severe forms of stroke that result in clear behavioral deficits. Human stroke, however, can vary widely in severity and clinical outcome. There is a rapidly building body of work suggesting that milder ischemic insults can precipitate functional impairment, including cognitive decline, that continues through the chronic phase after injury. Here we show that a small infarction localized to the frontal motor cortex of rats following injection of endothelin-1 results in an essentially asymptomatic state based on motor and cognitive testing, and yet produces significant histopathological change including remote atrophy and inflammation that persists up to 1 year. While there is understandably a major focus in stroke research on mitigating the acute consequences of primary infarction, these results point to progressive atrophy and chronic inflammation as additional targets for intervention in the chronic phase after injury. The present rodent model provides an important platform for further work in this area.</p>

<p>The exercise during the adult life of the offspring, associated with iron supplementation during the pregnancies, proved to be of benefit. However, no relation was found between iron restriction in fetal programming and the occurrence of restless legs syndrome phenotype.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron restriction during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency and changes in the dopaminergic system in the adulthood of offspring, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) is closely related to these changes. Objectives: Analyze whether iron restriction during pregnancy would cause changes in the behavior, sleep, and dopaminergic system of the male offspring. In addition, we aimed to assess whether exercise would be able to modulate these variables. The pregnant rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups with different concentrations of iron in the diet: standard (St), supplementation (Su), restriction since weaning (R1), and restriction only during pregnancy (R2). After birth, the offspring were assigned to their respective groups according to the dams diet (St, Su, R1, and R2) and distributed into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) (for 8 weeks of training), reaching eight groups of offspring (O): OSt SD, OSt EX, OSu SD, OSu EX, OR1 SD, OR1 EX, OR2 SD, and OR2 EX. Sleep, behavior, and analysis of key genes of dopaminergic system (D2, DAT) were performed after 8 weeks. The results for trained offspring that the mother received supplementation diet were the most expressive, with increased freezing and the OR1 SD group showed an increase in DAT protein content. These changes may have been due to the association between the dams diet during pregnancy and the practice of exercise by the offspring. The different concentrations of iron during pregnancy caused changes in the offspring, however, they were not associated with fetal programming in the context of RLS.</p>

                Our inability to derive the vast neuronal diversity of the posterior central nervous system (pCNS) using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) poses a major impediment to understanding human neurodevelopment and disease in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Here we establish a modular differentiation paradigm that recapitulates patterning along both the rostrocaudal (R/C) and dorsoventral (D/V) axes of the pCNS, enabling derivation of any neuronal phenotype with discrete regional specificity. First, neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) with discrete Hox profiles are efficiently converted to pCNS progenitors (pCNSPs). Then by tuning D/V signaling, pCNSPs are directed to ventral Shh-dependent MNs (MNs) and locomotor interneurons (INs) or dorsal TGF-{beta}-dependent proprioceptive INs and TGF-{beta}-independent sensory INs. We applied D/V protocols to NMPs spanning the R/C axis for expansive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis. By implementing a novel computational pipeline comprising sparse non-negative matrix factorization, consensus clustering, and combinatorial gene expression pattern identification, we detect hundreds of transcriptional markers within region-specific neuronal phenotypes, enabling discovery of gene expression patterns along the developmental axes. These findings highlight the potential of these resources to advance a mechanistic understanding of pCNS development, expand the potential and accuracy of in vitro models, and inform novel regenerative therapeutic strategies.

	<p>Background: Interoceptive accuracy and sensibility are decreased in depressive samples. However, different studies showed that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness interventions are promising approaches to improve interoceptive abilities. Based on these findings, the study aims to investigate the pre–post effect of CBT in a depressive sample. Additionally, we examined the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training in the context of CBT. Methods: Sixty depressive patients were investigated over four weeks, with two conditions—CBT vs. CBT + MBSR. Further, the changes in interoceptive abilities (interoceptive accuracy and sensibility) of the depressive patients were compared to baseline data of healthy controls. Results: The depressive patients showed significantly higher levels of depression and lower mindfulness and interoceptive abilities than healthy controls. The depressive sample showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and increased mindfulness and interoceptive abilities after CBT. Lastly, depressive patients of the CBT + MBSR condition did not differ from those who only received CBT in the levels of depression, mindfulness or interoceptive abilities over the time course. Discussion: This study demonstrates a positive effect of CBT on interoceptive abilities in a depressive sample. It is shown that the depressive sample did not profit from additional mindfulness training. It can be concluded that CBT is an efficient treatment, resulting in increased interoceptive abilities. Unexpectedly, the combination of CBT and MBSR has no additional effect on these changes. Future studies should investigate the effect of MBSR as a stand-alone therapy.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder with onset of characteristic motor symptoms at midlife, preceded by subtle cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Transcriptional dysregulation emerges early in the disease course and is considered central to HD pathogenesis. Using wild-type (wt) and HD knock-in mouse striatal cell lines we observed a HD genotype-dependent reduction in the protein levels of transcription factor 4 (TCF4), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family with critical roles in brain development and function. We characterized mouse <I>Tcf4</I> gene structure and expression of alternative mRNAs and protein isoforms in cell-based models of HD, and in four different brain regions of male transgenic HD mice (R6/1) from young to mature adulthood. The largest decrease in the levels of TCF4 at mRNA and specific protein isoforms were detected in the R6/1 mouse hippocampus. Translating this finding to human disease, we found reduced expression of long TCF4 isoforms in the postmortem hippocampal CA1 area and in the cerebral cortex of HD patients. Additionally, TCF4 protein isoforms showed differential synergism with the proneural transcription factor ASCL1 in activating reporter gene transcription in hippocampal and cortical cultured neurons. Induction of neuronal activity increased these synergistic effects in hippocampal but not in cortical neurons, suggesting brain region-dependent differences in TCF4 functions. Collectively, this study demonstrates isoform-specific changes in TCF4 expression in HD that could contribute to the progressive impairment of transcriptional regulation and neuronal function in this disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Normal Aging Affects the Short-Term Temporal Stability of Implicit, But Not Explicit, Motor Learning following Visuomotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Normal aging is associated with a decline in memory and motor learning ability. However, the exact form of these impairments (e.g., the short-term temporal stability and affected learning mechanisms) is largely unknown. Here, we used a sensorimotor adaptation task to examine changes in the temporal stability of two forms of learning (explicit and implicit) because of normal aging. Healthy young subjects (age range, 19&ndash;28 years; 20 individuals) and older human subjects (age range, 63&ndash;85 years; 19 individuals) made reaching movements in response to altered visual feedback. On each trial, subjects turned a rotation dial to select an explicit aiming direction. Once selected, the display was removed and subjects moved the cursor from the start position to the target. After initial training with the rotational feedback perturbation, subjects completed a series of probe trials at different delay periods to systematically assess the short-term retention of learning. For both groups, the explicit aiming showed no significant decrease over 1.5 min. However, this was not the case for implicit learning; the decay pattern was markedly different between groups. Older subjects showed a linear decrease of the implicit component of adaptation over time, while young subjects showed an exponential decay over the same period (time constant, 25.61 s). Although older subjects adapted at a similar rate, these results suggest natural aging selectively impacts the short-term (seconds to minutes) temporal stability of implicit motor learning mechanisms. This understanding may provide a means to dissociate natural aging memory impairments from deficits caused by brain disorders that progress with aging.</p>

                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be also considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from SARS-CoV-1 are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for virus replication, host cell invasion, and host immune response. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2, we identify two sites: one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other at the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction; for SARS-CoV-1, one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a directed passage model for viral constructs, including virus replicase, in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Model and data together allow us to infer a hypothetical tripartite genome assembly scheme for the synthetic biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.   Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, but not that of RaTG13, BANAL-20-52 and all other closest SARS coronavirus family members identified, are carriers of distinct homology signals that might point to large-scale genomic editing during a passage of directed replication and chromosomal integration inside genetically modified yeast cells.

While the slipknot topology in proteins has been known for over a decade, its evolutionary origin is still a mystery. We have identified a previously overlooked slipknot motif in a family of two-domain membrane transporters. Moreover, we found that these proteins are homologous to several families of unknotted membrane proteins. This allows us to directly investigate the evolution of the slipknot motif. Based on our comprehensive analysis of 17 distantly related protein families, we have found that slipknotted and unknotted proteins share a common structural motif. Furthermore, this motif is conserved on the sequential level as well. Our results suggest that, regardless of topology, the proteins we studied evolved from a common unknotted ancestor single domain protein. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the presence of at least seven parallel evolutionary scenarios that led to the current diversity of proteins in question. The tools we have developed in the process can now be used to investigate the evolution of other repeated-domain proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamics and turnover of memory CD8 T cell responses following yellow fever vaccination</a></h4>

Understanding how immunological memory lasts a lifetime requires quantifying changes in the number of memory cells as well as how their division and death rates change over time. We address these questions by using a statistically powerful mixed-effects differential equations framework to analyze data from two human studies that follow CD8 T cell responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YFV-17D). Models were first fit to the frequency of YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells and deuterium enrichment in those cells 42 days to 1 year post-vaccination. A different dataset, on the loss of YFV-specific CD8 T cells over three decades, was used to assess out of sample predictions of our models. The commonly used exponential and bi-exponential decline models performed relatively poorly. Models with the cell loss following a power law (exactly or approximately) were most predictive. Notably, using only the first year of data, these models accurately predicted T cell frequencies up to 30 years post-vaccination. Our analyses suggest that division rates of these cells drop and plateau at a low level (0.1% per day, ∼ double the estimated values for naive T cells) within one year following vaccination, whereas death rates continue to decline for much longer. Our results show that power laws can be predictive for T cell memory, a finding that may be useful for vaccine evaluation and epidemiological modeling. Moreover, since power laws asymptotically decline more slowly than any exponential decline, our results help explain the longevity of immune memory phenomenologically.

                <p>by Mario Castro, Rob J. de Boer</p>

In their Commentary paper, Villaverde and Massonis (On testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method: relying on scaling symmetries can be misleading) have commented on our paper in which we proposed a simple scaling method to test structural identifiability. Our scaling invariance method (SIM) tests for scaling symmetries only, and Villaverde and Massonis correctly show the SIM may fail to detect identifiability problems when a model has other types of symmetries. We agree with the limitations raised by these authors but, also, we emphasize that the method is still valuable for its applicability to a wide variety of models, its simplicity, and even as a tool to introduce the problem of identifiability to investigators with little training in mathematics.

                <p>by Maxwell W. Libbrecht, Rachel C. W. Chan, Michael M. Hoffman</p>

Segmentation and genome annotation (SAGA) algorithms are widely used to understand genome activity and gene regulation. These algorithms take as input epigenomic datasets, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) measurements of histone modifications or transcription factor binding. They partition the genome and assign a label to each segment such that positions with the same label exhibit similar patterns of input data. SAGA algorithms discover categories of activity such as promoters, enhancers, or parts of genes without prior knowledge of known genomic elements. In this sense, they generally act in an unsupervised fashion like clustering algorithms, but with the additional simultaneous function of segmenting the genome. Here, we review the common methodological framework that underlies these methods, review variants of and improvements upon this basic framework, and discuss the outlook for future work. This review is intended for those interested in applying SAGA methods and for computational researchers interested in improving upon them.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Universal risk phenotype of US counties for flu-like transmission to improve county-specific COVID-19 incidence forecasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi Huang, Ishanu Chattopadhyay</p>

The spread of a communicable disease is a complex spatio-temporal process shaped by the specific transmission mechanism, and diverse factors including the behavior, socio-economic and demographic properties of the host population. While the key factors shaping transmission of influenza and COVID-19 are beginning to be broadly understood, making precise forecasts on case count and mortality is still difficult. In this study we introduce the concept of a universal geospatial risk phenotype of individual US counties facilitating flu-like transmission mechanisms. We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score, which is computed as an information-theoretic divergence of the local incidence time series from an high-risk process of epidemic initiation, inferred from almost a decade of flu season incidence data gleaned from the diagnostic history of nearly a third of the US population. Despite being computed from the past seasonal flu incidence records, the UnIT score emerges as the dominant factor explaining incidence trends for the COVID-19 pandemic over putative demographic and socio-economic factors. The predictive ability of the UnIT score is further demonstrated via county-specific weekly case count forecasts which consistently outperform the state of the art models throughout the time-line of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study demonstrates that knowledge of past epidemics may be used to chart the course of future ones, if transmission mechanisms are broadly similar, despite distinct disease processes and causative pathogens.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interplay between mobility, multi-seeding and lockdowns shapes COVID-19 local impact</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mattia Mazzoli, Emanuele Pepe, David Mateo, Ciro Cattuto, Laetitia Gauvin, Paolo Bajardi, Michele Tizzoni, Alberto Hernando, Sandro Meloni, José J. Ramasco</p>

Assessing the impact of mobility on epidemic spreading is of crucial importance for understanding the effect of policies like mass quarantines and selective re-openings. While many factors affect disease incidence at a local level, making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can lead to independent outbreaks that spark from distinct areas of the local contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost incidence, making control efforts and contact tracing less effective. Here, through a modeling approach we show that the effect produced by the number of initial infections is non-linear on the incidence peak and peak time. When case importations are carried by mobility from an already infected area, this effect is further enhanced by the local demography and underlying mixing patterns: the impact of every seed is larger in smaller populations. Finally, both in the model simulations and the analysis, we show that a multi-seeding effect combined with mobility restrictions can explain the observed spatial heterogeneities in the first wave of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in five European countries. Our results allow us for identifying what we have called epidemic epicenter: an area that shapes incidence and mortality peaks in the entire country. The present work further clarifies the nonlinear effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight their relevance for epidemic control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">On testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method: Relying on scaling symmetries can be misleading</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alejandro F. Villaverde, Gemma Massonis</p>

A recent paper published in <i>PLOS Computational Biology</i> [1] introduces the Scaling Invariance Method (SIM) for analysing structural local identifiability and observability. These two properties define mathematically the possibility of determining the values of the parameters (identifiability) and states (observability) of a dynamic model by observing its output. In this note we warn that SIM considers scaling symmetries as the only possible cause of non-identifiability and non-observability. We show that other types of symmetries can cause the same problems without being detected by SIM, and that in those cases the method may lead one to conclude that the model is identifiable and observable when it is actually not.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Rapid increase in snake dietary diversity and complexity following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael C. Grundler, Daniel L. Rabosky</p>

The Cenozoic marked a period of dramatic ecological opportunity in Earth history due to the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs as well as to long-term physiographic changes that created new biogeographic theaters and new habitats. Snakes underwent massive ecological diversification during this period, repeatedly evolving novel dietary adaptations and prey preferences. The evolutionary tempo and mode of these trophic ecological changes remain virtually unknown, especially compared with co-radiating lineages of birds and mammals that are simultaneously predators and prey of snakes. Here, we assemble a dataset on snake diets (34,060 observations on the diets of 882 species) to investigate the history and dynamics of the multidimensional trophic niche during the global radiation of snakes. Our results show that per-lineage dietary niche breadths remained remarkably constant even as snakes diversified to occupy disparate outposts of dietary ecospace. Rapid increases in dietary diversity and complexity occurred in the early Cenozoic, and the overall rate of ecospace expansion has slowed through time, suggesting a potential response to ecological opportunity in the wake of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Explosive bursts of trophic innovation followed colonization of the Nearctic and Neotropical realms by a group of snakes that today comprises a majority of living snake diversity. Our results indicate that repeated transformational shifts in dietary ecology are important drivers of adaptive radiation in snakes and provide a framework for analyzing and visualizing the evolution of complex ecological phenotypes on phylogenetic trees.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cost-effectiveness of patient navigation for lung cancer – a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patient navigation (PN) programs have been shown to increase patient satisfaction and quality of life among patients with lung cancer and to decrease time to treatment. However, the general cost-effectiveness of such programs in the context of lung cancer remains unknown. Hence, the aim of the present systematic review was to analyze the scientific literature and quantitatively assess the level of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PN programs for patients diagnosed with lung cancer.  Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases without time limitations. Randomized controlled trials written in English or German were eligible for inclusion if any results regarding the cost-effectiveness of personally delivered PN programs for patients after lung cancer diagnosis were reported. A manual search was carried out to supplement the systematic search. Additionally, the authors of ongoing or unpublished relevant research were contacted. The titles, abstracts and full texts of relevant citations were screened independently by two reviewers.   Results: The initial search yielded 814 articles, including four papers identified manually. Twenty-one articles were included in the full text screening. However, no study met the inclusion criteria. Contacting the authors of ongoing or unpublished research and cross-cancer studies did not yield any studies that met the inclusion criteria.   Conclusion: Since no study met the inclusion criteria, this study reveals a research gap in this area. Furthermore, no conclusive statement regarding the cost-effectiveness of patient navigation programs for patients diagnosed with lung cancer can be made. Since the implementation of new healthcare models such as PN at least partially depends on their cost-effectiveness, future attempts to evaluate PN programs for lung cancer patients should consider examining outcomes related to cost-effectiveness to overcome the identified research gap.

                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-y, TNF-α and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-y and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

                Background: SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease and led to the pandemic currently affecting the world has been broadly investigated. Different studies have been performed to understand the infection mechanism, and the involved human genes, transcripts and proteins. In parallel, numerous clinical extra-pulmonary manifestations co-occurring with COVID-19 disease have been reported and evidence of their severity and persistence is increasing. Whether these manifestations are linked to other disorders co-occurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection, is under discussion. In this work, we report the identification of toxin-like peptides in COVID-19 patients by application of the Liquid Chromatography Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization – Cloud Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.   Methods: Plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients and control individuals were analysed to study peptidomic toxins’ profiles. Protein precipitation preparation procedure was used for plasma, to remove high molecular weight proteins and efficiently solubilize the peptide fraction; in the case of faeces and urine, direct peptide solubilization was employed.   Results: Toxin-like peptides, almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals, like conotoxins, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, zinc metal proteinases, and bradykinins, were identified in samples from COVID-19 patients, but not in control samples.  Conclusions: The presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between COVID-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. Their involvement in a large set of heterogeneous extra-pulmonary COVID-19 clinical manifestations, like neurological ones, cannot be excluded. Although the presence of each individual symptom is not selective of the disease, their combination might be related to COVID-19 by the coexistence of the panel of the here detected toxin-like peptides. The presence of these peptides opens new scenarios on the aetiology of the COVID-19 clinical symptoms observed up to now, including neurological manifestations.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 14 October 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26169-z">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26169-z</a></p>Generally, wavefronts are measured using angle-based sensors like the Shack-Hartmann sensor. Here, the authors present an angle-sensitive device that uses flat optics integrated on a focal plane array for compact wavefront sensing with improved resolution.

Here the authors performed a genome-wide sgRNA screen to identify Morc3 as a mediator of ERV silencing. They show Morc3 associates with the H3.3 chaperone Daxx, and that loss of Morc3 leads to reduced H3.3 at ERVs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">circFL-seq reveals full-length circular RNAs with rolling circular reverse transcription and nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) act through multiple mechanisms via their sequence features to fine-tune gene expression networks. Due to overlapping sequences with linear cognates, identifying internal sequences of circRNAs remains a challenge, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of circRNA functions and mechanisms. Here, based on rolling circular reverse transcription (RCRT) and nanopore sequencing, we developed circFL-seq, a full-length circRNA sequencing method, to profile circRNA at the isoform level. With a customized computational pipeline to directly identify full-length sequences from rolling circular reads, we reconstructed 77,606 high-quality circRNAs from seven human cell lines and two human tissues. circFL-seq benefits from rolling circles and long-read sequencing, and the results showed more than tenfold enrichment of circRNA reads and advantages for both detection and quantification at the isoform level compared to those for short-read RNA sequencing. The concordance of the RT-qPCR and circFL-seq results for the identification of differential alternative splicing suggested wide application prospects for functional studies of internal variants in circRNAs. Moreover, the detection of fusion circRNAs at the omics scale may further expand the application of circFL-seq. Together, the accurate identification and quantification of full-length circRNAs make circFL-seq a potential tool for large-scale screening of functional circRNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The generation of cortical novelty responses through inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Animals depend on fast and reliable detection of novel stimuli in their environment. Neurons in multiple sensory areas respond more strongly to novel in comparison to familiar stimuli. Yet, it remains unclear which circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlie those responses. Here, we show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity of inhibitory-to-excitatory synapses generates novelty responses in a recurrent spiking network model. Inhibitory plasticity increases the inhibition onto excitatory neurons tuned to familiar stimuli, while inhibition for novel stimuli remains low, leading to a network novelty response. The generation of novelty responses does not depend on the periodicity but rather on the distribution of presented stimuli. By including tuning of inhibitory neurons, the network further captures stimulus-specific adaptation. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition can control the amplification of novelty responses. Therefore, inhibitory plasticity provides a flexible, biologically plausible mechanism to detect the novelty of bottom-up stimuli, enabling us to make experimentally testable predictions.

                Envisioning the future is intuitively linked to our ability to remember the past. Within the memory system, substantial work has demonstrated the involvement of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in representing the past and present. Recent data shows that both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus encode future trajectories, which are segregated in time by alternating cycles of the theta rhythm. Here, we discuss how information is temporally organized by these brain regions supported by the medial septum, nucleus reuniens, and parahippocampal regions. Finally, we highlight a brain circuit that we predict is essential for the temporal segregation of future scenarios.

                Osteoblast differentiation is sequentially characterized by high rates of proliferation followed by increased protein and matrix synthesis, processes that require substantial amino acid acquisition and production. How osteoblasts obtain or maintain intracellular amino acid production is poorly understood. Here we identify SLC1A5 as a critical amino acid transporter during bone development. Using a genetic and metabolomic approach, we show SLC1A5 acts cell autonomously to regulate protein synthesis and osteoblast differentiation. SLC1A5 provides both glutamine and asparagine which are essential for osteoblast differentiation. Mechanistically, glutamine and to a lesser extent asparagine support amino acid biosynthesis. Thus, osteoblasts depend on <i>Slc1a5 </i>to provide glutamine and asparagine, which are subsequently used to produce non-essential amino acids and support osteoblast differentiation and bone development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An open-source, high-performance tool for automated sleep staging</a></h4>

              
                The clinical and societal measurement of human sleep has increased exponentially in recent years. However, unlike other fields of medical analysis that have become highly automated, basic and clinical sleep research still relies on human visual scoring. Such human-based evaluations are time-consuming, tedious, and can be prone to subjective bias. Here, we describe a novel algorithm trained and validated on +30,000 hr of polysomnographic sleep recordings across heterogeneous populations around the world. This tool offers high sleep-staging accuracy that matches human scoring accuracy and interscorer agreement no matter the population kind. The software is designed to be especially easy to use, computationally low-demanding, open source, and free. Our hope is that this software facilitates the broad adoption of an industry-standard automated sleep staging software package.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature distribution learning by passive exposure</a></h4>

              
                Humans can rapidly estimate the statistical properties of groups of stimuli, including their average and variability. But recent studies of so-called Feature Distribution Learning (FDL) have shown that observers can quickly learn even more complex aspects of feature distributions. In FDL, observers learn the full shape of a distribution of features in a set of distractor stimuli and use this information to improve visual search: response times (RT) are slowed if the target feature lies inside the previous distractor distribution, and the RT patterns closely reflect the distribution shape. FDL requires only a few trials and is markedly sensitive to different distribution types. It is unknown, however, whether our perceptual system encodes feature distributions automatically and by passive exposure, or whether this learning requires active engagement with the stimuli. In two experiments, we sought to answer this question. During an initial exposure stage, participants passively viewed a display of 36 lines that included one orientation singleton or no singletons. In the following search display, they had to find an oddly oriented target. The orientations of the lines were determined either by a Gaussian or a uniform distribution. We found evidence for FDL only when the passive trials contained an orientation singleton. Under these conditions, RT decreased as a function of the orientation distance between the target and the exposed distractor distribution. These results suggest that FDL can occur by passive exposure, but only if an orientation singleton appears during exposure to the distribution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tagging active neurons by soma-targeted Cal-Light</a></h4>

              
                Verifying causal effects of neural circuits is essential for proving direct a circuit-behavior relationship. However, techniques for tagging only active neurons with high spatiotemporal precision remain at the beginning stages. Here we developed the soma-targeted Cal-Light (ST-Cal-Light) which selectively converts somatic calcium rise triggered by action potentials into gene expression. Such modification simultaneously increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of reporter gene expression and reduces the light requirement for successful labeling. Because of the enhanced efficacy, the ST-Cal-Light enables the tagging of functionally engaged neurons in various forms of behaviors, including context-dependent fear conditioning, lever-pressing choice behavior, and social interaction behaviors. We also targeted kainic acid-sensitive neuronal populations in the hippocampus which subsequently suppressed seizure symptoms, suggesting its applicability in controlling disease-related neurons. Furthermore, the generation of a conditional ST-Cal-Light knock-in (KI) mouse provides an opportunity to tag active neurons in a region- or cell-type specific manner via crossing with other Cre-driver lines. Thus, the versatile ST-Cal-Light system links somatic action potentials to behaviors with high temporal precision, and ultimately allows functional circuit dissection at a single cell resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vivo imaging of the GnRH pulse generator reveals a temporal order of neuronal activation and synchronization during each pulse</a></h4>

              
                A hypothalamic pulse generator located in the arcuate nucleus controls episodic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and is essential for reproduction. Recent evidence suggests this generator is comprised of arcuate 'KNDy' cells, the abbreviation based on co-expression of kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. However, direct visual evidence of KNDy neuron activity at a single-cell level during a pulse is lacking. Here, we use in vivo calcium imaging in freely moving female mice to show that individual KNDy neurons are synchronously activated in an episodic manner, and these synchronized episodes always precede LH pulses. Furthermore, synchronization among KNDy cells occurs in a temporal order, with some subsets of KNDy cells serving as 'leaders' and others as 'followers' during each synchronized episode. These results reveal an unsuspected temporal organization of activation and synchronization within the GnRH pulse generator, suggesting that different subsets of KNDy neurons are activated at pulse onset than afterward during maintenance and eventual termination of each pulse. Further studies to distinguish KNDy leader from follower cells is likely to have important clinical significance, since regulation of pulsatile GnRH secretion is essential for normal reproduction and disrupted in pathological conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothalamic amenorrhea.

                Stress exposure is a cardinal risk factor for most psychiatric diseases. Preclinical and clinical studies point to changes in gene expression involving epigenetic modifications within mesocorticolimbic brain circuits. Brahma (BRM) and Brahma-Related-Gene-1 (BRG1) are ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential to enduring plastic changes in gene expression. Here, we show that repeated social defeat induces changes in BRG1 nuclear distribution. The inactivation of the Brg1/Smarca4 gene within dopamine-innervated regions or the constitutive inactivation of the Brm/Smarca2 gene leads to resilience to repeated social defeat and decreases the behavioral responses to cocaine without impacting midbrain dopamine neurons activity. Within striatal medium spiny neurons Brg1 gene inactivation reduces the expression of stress- and cocaine-induced immediate early genes, increases levels of heterochromatin and at a global scale decreases chromatin accessibility. Altogether these data demonstrate the pivotal function of SWI/SNF complexes in behavioral and transcriptional adaptations to salient environmental challenges.

                A central principle of synaptic transmission is that action potential induced presynaptic neurotransmitter release occurs exclusively via Ca2+ dependent secretion (CDS). T he discovery and mechanistic investigations of Ca2+ independent but voltage dependent secretion (CiVDS) have demonstrated that the action potential per se is sufficient to trigger neurotransmission in the somata of primary sensory and sympathetic neurons in mammals. One key question remains, however, whether CiVDS contributes to central synaptic transmission. Here we report, in the central transmission from presynaptic (dorsal root ganglion) to postsynaptic (spinal dorsal horn) neurons, (1) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are mediated by glutamate transmission through both CiVDS up to 87%) and CDS; (2) CiVDS EPSC s are in dependent of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+; (3) CiVDS is >100 times faster than CDS in vesicle recycling with much less short term depression; 4) the fusion machinery of CiVDS includes Cav2.2 (voltage sensor) and SNARE (fusion pore). Together, an essential component of activity induced EPSCs is mediated by CiVDS in a central synapse.

                Senescence affects various aspects of sleep, and it remains unclear how sleep-related neuronal network activity is altered by senescence. Here, we recorded local field potential signals from multiple brain regions covering the forebrain in young (10-week-old) and aged (2-year-old) mice. Interregional LFP correlations across these brain regions showed smaller differences between awake and sleep states in aged mice. Multivariate analyses with machine learning algorithms with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and robust continuous clustering (RCC) demonstrated that these LFP correlational patterns in aged mice less represented awake/sleep states than those in young mice. By housing aged mice in an enriched environment, the LFP patterns were restored to those observed in young mice. Our results demonstrate senescence-induced changes in neuronal activity at the network level and provide insight into the prevention of pathological symptoms associated with sleep disturbance in senescence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity networks of common synaptic inputs to motor neurons reveal neural spinal synergies during a multi-joint task</a></h4>

              
                Movements are reportedly controlled through the combination of synergies that generate specific motor outputs by imposing an activation pattern on a group of muscles. To date, the smallest unit of analysis has been the muscle through the measurement of its activation. However, the muscle is not the lowest neural level of movement control. In this human study, we identified the common synaptic inputs received by motor neurons during an isometric multi-joint task. We decoded the spiking activities of dozens of spinal motor neurons innervating six lower limb muscles in 10 participants. Furthermore, we analyzed these activities by identifying their common low-frequency components, from which networks of common synaptic inputs to the motor neurons were derived. The vast majority of the identified motor neurons shared common inputs with other motor neuron(s). In addition, groups of motor neurons were partly decoupled from their innervated muscle, such that motor neurons innervating the same muscle did not necessarily receive common inputs. Conversely, some motor neurons from different muscles, including distant muscles, received common inputs. Our results provide evidence of a synergistic control of a multi-joint motor task at the spinal motor neuron level. Moreover, we showed that common input to motor neurons is an essential feature of the neural control of movement. We conclude that the central nervous system controls flexible groups of motor neurons by distributing common inputs to substantially reduce the dimensionality of movement control.

                Backgroud -synuclein, a protein involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, is subjected to several post-translational modifications. Among them, C-terminal truncation seems to increase its aggregation propensity in vitro. Hemoglobin is the major protein in erythrocytes to carries oxygen and recently is found to be expressed in dopaminergic neurons and to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Methods To assess the role of hemoglobin in -synuclein post-translational modification and in dopamine cells physiology, we over-expressed  and {beta}-chains of Hb in iMN9D dopamine cells to evaluate its effect on -synuclein truncation. Using an AAV9 we expressed  and {beta}-chains of hemoglobin in dopamine neurons of Substantia Nigra pars compacta and evaluate its effect on -synuclein post-translational modification, dopamine neurons survivals and behavioural outcome. Results The over-expression of  and {beta}-chains of hemoglobin in iMN9D dopamine cells increased C-terminal truncation of -synuclein when cells were treated with -synuclein preformed fibrils. This cleavage was led at least in part by Calpain protease. Hemoglobin over-expression in Substantia Nigra pars compacta induced a similar pattern of -synuclein truncation and a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase expression, unveiling a decrease of dopamine neurons of about 50%. This dopamine cells loss led to a mild motor impairment and a deficit in recognition and spatial working memory. Conclusion Our study reveals a novel role for hemoglobin in -synuclein post-translational modification and in dopamine neurons homeostasis suggesting neuronal hemoglobin is an important modifier in synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease.

                Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors. The high heterogeneity of the disease may be explained by gene and environmental interactions and potential risk factors include immune dysfunctions and immune-mediated co-morbidities. Mutations in the SHANK3 gene have been recognized as a genetic risk factor for ASD. While heterozygous SHANK3 mutations are usually the types of mutations associated with idiopathic autism in patients, heterozygous deletion of Shank3 gene in mice does not commonly induce ASD-related behavioural deficit. Here, we used in-vivo and ex-vivo approaches to demonstrate that region-specific neonatal downregulation of Shank3 in the NAc promotes D1R-MSN hyperexcitability and upregulates Trpv4 to impair social behaviour. Interestingly, genetically vulnerable Shank3+/- mice, when challenged with Lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammatory response, showed similar circuit and behavioural alterations that were rescued by acute Trpv4 inhibition. Altogether our data demonstrate shared molecular and circuit mechanisms between ASD-relevant genetic alterations and environmental insults, which ultimately lead to sociability dysfunctions.

                In modern society, the widespread use of artificial light at night disrupts the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which serves as our central circadian clock. Existing models describe excitatory responses of the SCN to primarily blue light, but direct measures in humans are absent. The combination of state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques and custom-made MRI compatible LED devices allowed to directly measure the light response of the SCN. In contrast to the general expectation, we found that SCN activity was suppressed by light. The suppressions were observed not only in response to narrowband blue light ({lambda}max: 470nm) but remarkably, also in response to green ({lambda}max: 515nm) and orange ({lambda}max: 590nm), but not to violet light ({lambda}max: 405nm). The broadband sensitivity of the SCN implies that strategies on light exposure should be revised: enhancement of light levels during daytime is possible with wavelengths other than blue, while during nighttime, all colors are potentially disruptive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Terminal selectors organize postmitotic chromatin accessibility for acquisition of serotonergic identity</a></h4>

              
                Assembly of transcriptomes encoding unique neuronal identities requires selective accessibility of regulatory inputs to cis-regulatory sequences in nucleosome-embedded chromatin. Yet the mechanisms involved in shaping postmitotic neuronal chromatin are poorly understood. Here we used ATAC-seq, ChIPmentation, and single-cell analyses to show that unique distal enhancers and super-enhancers define the Pet1 neuron lineage that generates serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Heterogeneous single cell chromatin landscapes are established early in postmitotic Pet1 neurons and reveal the regulatory programs driving Pet1 neuron subtype identities. Terminal selectors, Pet1 and Lmx1b, control chromatin accessibility in Pet1 neurons to select enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis. In addition, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous terminal selector input. Together our findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of terminal selectors in organizing postmitotic accessible chromatin for the development of specialized neuronal identities.

                A core taken in a tree today can reveal climate events from centuries past. Here we adapt this idea to record histories of neural activation. We engineered slowly growing intracellular protein fibers which can incorporate diverse fluorescent marks during growth to store linear ticker tape-like histories. An embedded HaloTag reporter incorporated user-supplied HaloTag-ligand dyes, leading to colored stripes whose boundaries mapped fiber growth to wall-clock time. A co-expressed eGFP tag driven by the cFos immediate early gene promoter recorded the history of neural activity. High-resolution multispectral imaging on fixed samples read the cellular histories. We demonstrated recordings of cFos activation in ensembles of cultured neurons with a single-cell absolute accuracy of approximately 39 min over a 12-hour interval. Protein-based ticker tapes have the potential to achieve massively parallel single-cell recordings of multiple physiological modalities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An atlas of white matter anatomy, its variability, and reproducibility based on Constrained Spherical Deconvolution of diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Virtual dissection of white matter (WM) using diffusion MRI tractography is confounded by its poor reproducibility. Despite the increased adoption of advanced reconstruction models, early region-of-interest driven protocols based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain the dominant reference for virtual dissection protocols. Here we bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of typical WM anatomy reconstructed using a reproducible automated subject-specific parcellation-based approach based on probabilistic constrained-spherical deconvolution (CSD) tractography. We complement this with a WM template in MNI space comprising 68 bundles, including all associated anatomical tract selection labels and associated automated workflows. Additionally, we demonstrate bundle inter- and intra-subject variability using 40 (20 test-retest) datasets from the human connectome project (HCP) and 5 sessions with varying b-values and number of b-shells from the single-subject Multiple Acquisitions for Standardization of Structural Imaging Validation and Evaluation (MASSIVE) dataset. The most reliably reconstructed bundles were the whole pyramidal tracts, primary corticospinal tracts, whole superior longitudinal fasciculi, frontal, parietal and occipital segments of the corpus callosum and middle cerebellar peduncles. More variability was found in less dense bundles, e.g., the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, fornix, dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRTT), and premotor pyramidal tract. Using the DRTT as an example, we show that this variability can be reduced by using a higher number of seeding attempts. Overall inter-session similarity was high for HCP test-retest data (median weighted-dice = 0.963, stdev = 0.201 and IQR = 0.099). Compared to the HCP-template bundles there was a high level of agreement for the HCP test-retest data (median weighted-dice = 0.747, stdev = 0.220 and IQR = 0.277) and for the MASSIVE data (median weighted-dice = 0.767, stdev = 0.255 and IQR = 0.338). In summary, this WM atlas provides an overview of the capabilities and limitations of automated subject-specific probabilistic CSD tractography for mapping white matter fasciculi in healthy adults. It will be most useful in applications requiring a highly reproducible parcellation-based dissection protocol, as well as being an educational resource for applied neuroimaging and clinical professionals.

                Background A growing body of evidence suggests that nuclear alpha-synuclein (aSyn) plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this question has been difficult to address as controlling the localization of aSyn in experimental systems often requires protein overexpression, which results in aggregation. Methods We engineered SncaNLS mice which localize endogenous aSyn to the nucleus. We characterized these mice on a behavioral, histological, and biochemical level to determine whether the increase of nuclear aSyn is sufficient to elicit disease phenotypes. Results SncaNLS mice exhibit age-dependent motor deficits and altered gastrointestinal function. We found that these phenotypes were not linked to aSyn aggregation or phosphorylation. Through histological analyses, we observed motor cortex atrophy in the absence of midbrain dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We sampled cortical proteomes of SncaNLS mice and controls to determine the molecular underpinnings of these pathologies. Interestingly, we found several dysregulated proteins involved in dopaminergic signaling, namely Darpp-32, which we further confirmed was decreased in cortical samples of the SncaNLS mice compared to controls via immunoblotting. Conclusions These results suggest that chronic endogenous nuclear aSyn can elicit toxic phenotypes in mice, independent of its aggregation. This model raises key questions related to the mechanism of aSyn toxicity in PD and provides a new model to study an underappreciated aspect of PD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cue-specific remodeling of the neuronal transcriptome through intron retention programs</a></h4>

              
                Sub-cellular compartmentalization through the nuclear envelope has for a long time been primarily considered a physical barrier that separates nuclear and cytosolic contents. More recently, nuclear compartmentalization has emerged to harbor key regulatory functions in gene expression. A sizeable proportion of protein-coding mRNAs is more prevalent in the nucleus than in the cytosol reflecting the existence of mechanisms to control mRNA release into the cytosol. However, the biological relevance of the nuclear retention of mRNAs remains unclear. Here, we provide a comprehensive map of the subcellular localization of mRNAs in mature neurons and reveal that transcripts stably retaining introns are broadly targeted for nuclear retention. We systematically probed these transcripts upon neuronal stimulation and found that sub-populations of nuclear-retained transcripts are bi-directionally regulated in response to cues: some appear targeted for degradation while others undergo splicing completion to generate fully mature mRNAs which are exported to the cytosol to increase functional gene expression. Remarkably, different forms of stimulation mobilize distinct groups of intron-retaining transcripts and this selectivity arises from the activation of specific signaling pathways. Overall, our findings uncover cue-specific control of intron retention as a major regulator of acute remodeling of the neuronal transcriptome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novelty and uncertainty interact to regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation in the human brain.</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence suggests that both novelty and uncertainty act as potent features guiding exploration. However, these variables are often conflated with each other experimentally, and an understanding of how these attributes interact to regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation has proved elusive. Using a novel task designed to decouple stimulus novelty and estimation uncertainty, we identify separable behavioral and neural mechanisms by which exploration is colored. We show that uncertainty was avoided except when the information gained through exploration could be reliably exploited in the future. In contrast, and contrary to existing theory, novel options grew increasingly attractive relative to familiar counterparts irrespective of the opportunity to leverage their consequences and despite the uncertainty inherent to novel options. These findings led us to develop a formal computational framework in which uncertainty directed choice adapts to the prospective utility of exploration, while novel stimuli persistently draw favor as a result of inflated reward expectations biasing an exploitative strategy. Crucially, novelty is proposed to actively modulate uncertainty processing, effectively blunting the influence of uncertainty in shaping the subjective utility ascribed to novel stimuli. Both behavioral data and fMRI activity sampled from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, frontopolar cortex and ventral striatum validate this model, thereby establishing a computational account that can not only explain behavior but also shed light on the functional contribution of these key brain regions to the exploration/exploitation trade-off. Our results point to multiple strategies and neural substrates charged with balancing the explore/exploit dilemma, with each targeting distinct aspects of the decision problem to foster a manageable decomposition of an otherwise intractable task.

                Auditory hair cells, the whole length of the cochlea, are routinely visualized using light microscopy techniques. It is common, therefore, for one to collect more data than is practical to analyze manually. There are currently no widely accepted tools for unsupervised, unbiased, and comprehensive analysis of cells in an entire cochlea. This represents a stark gap between image-based data and other tests of cochlear function. To close this gap, we present a machine learning-based hair cell analysis toolbox, for the analysis of whole cochleae, imaged with confocal microscopy. The software presented here allows the automation of common image analysis tasks such as counting hair cells, determining their best frequency, as well as quantifying single cell immunofluorescence intensities along the entire cochlear coil. We hope these automated tools will remove a considerable barrier in cochlear image analysis, allowing for more informative and less selective data analysis practices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aperiodic EEG activity masks the dynamics of neural oscillations during loss of consciousness from propofol</a></h4>

              
                EEGs are known to provide biomarkers for consciousness. Although EEG correlates of loss of consciousness (LOC) are often ascribed to changes in neural synchrony, mounting evidence suggests that some changes result from asynchronous neural activity. By combining EEG recordings of humans undergoing propofol administration with biophysical modelling, we present here a principled decomposition of EEG changes during LOC into synchronous and asynchronous sources. Our results reveal that IPSP decay rate and mean spike rate shape aperiodic EEG features, and that propofol's effects on these parameters largely explain the changes in EEG spectra following propofol infusion. We further show that traditional spectral EEG analysis likely conflates these effects with changes in rhythmic activity, thereby masking the true dynamics of neural synchrony. We conclude that the well-documented propofol-induced alpha rhythm in fact appears before LOC, and that the moment of LOC is uniquely correlated with the sudden appearance of a delta rhythm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multi-dataset evaluation of frame censoring for task-based fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Subject motion during fMRI can affect our ability to accurately measure signals of interest. In recent years, frame censoring--that is, statistically excluding motion-contaminated data within the general linear model using nuisance regressors--has appeared in several task-based fMRI studies as a mitigation strategy. However, there have been few systematic investigations quantifying its efficacy. In the present study, we compared the performance of frame censoring to several other common motion correction approaches for task-based fMRI using open data and reproducible workflows. We analyzed eight datasets available on OpenNeuro.org representing eleven distinct tasks in child, adolescent, and adult participants. Performance was quantified using maximum t-values in group analyses, and ROI-based mean activation and split-half reliability in single subjects. We compared frame censoring to the use of 6 and 24 canonical motion regressors, wavelet despiking, robust weighted least squares, and untrained ICA-based denoising. Thresholds used to identify censored frames were based on both motion estimates (FD) and image intensity changes (DVARS). Relative to standard motion regressors, we found consistent improvements for modest amounts of frame censoring (e.g., 1-2% data loss), although these gains were frequently comparable to what could be achieved using other techniques. Importantly, no single approach consistently outperformed the others across all datasets and tasks. These findings suggest that although frame censoring can improve results, the choice of a motion mitigation strategy depends on the dataset and the outcome metric of interest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PyMVPD: A toolbox for multivariate pattern dependence</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive tasks engage multiple brain regions. Studying how these regions interact is key to understand the neural bases of cognition. Standard approaches to model the interactions between brain regions rely on univariate statistical dependence. However, newly developed methods can capture multivariate dependence. Multivariate Pattern Dependence (MVPD) is a powerful and flexible approach that trains and tests multivariate models of the interactions between brain regions using independent data. In this article, we introduce PyMVPD: an open source toolbox for Multivariate Pattern Dependence. The toolbox includes pre-implemented linear regression models and artificial neural network models of the interactions between regions. It is designed to be easily customizable. We demonstrate example applications of PyMVPD using well-studied seed regions such as the fusiform face area (FFA) and the parahippocampal place area (PPA). Next, we compare the performance of different model architectures. Overall, artificial neural networks outperform linear regression. Importantly, the best performing architecture is region-dependent: MVPD subdivides cortex in distinct, contiguous regions whose interaction with FFA and PPA is best captured by different models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep learning models of cognitive processes constrained by human brain connectomes</a></h4>

              
                Brain decoding aims to infer cognitive states from recordings of brain activity. Current literature has mainly focused on isolated brain regions engaged in specific experimental conditions, but ignored the integrative nature of cognitive processes recruiting distributed brain networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a connectome-based graph neural network to integrate distributed patterns of brain activity in a multiscale manner, ranging from localized brain regions, to a specific brain circuit/network and towards the full brain. We evaluate the decoding model using a large task-fMRI database from the human connectome project. By implementing connectomic constraints and multiscale interactions in deep graph convolutions, the model achieves high accuracy of decoding 21 cognitive states (93%, chancel level: 4.8%) and shows high robustness against adversarial attacks on the graph architecture. Our study bridges human connectomes with deep learning techniques and provides new avenues to study the underlying neural substrates of human cognition at scale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microscopic Quantification of Oxygen Consumption across Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex is organized in cortical layers that differ in their cellular density, composition, and wiring. Cortical laminar architecture is also readily revealed by staining for cytochrome oxidase - the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It has been hypothesized that a high-density band of cytochrome oxidase in cortical layer IV reflects higher oxygen consumption under baseline (unstimulated) conditions. Here, we tested the above hypothesis using direct measurements of the partial pressure of O 2 (pO 2 ) in cortical tissue by means of 2-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM). We revisited our previously developed method for extraction of the cerebral metabolic rate of O 2 (CMRO 2 ) based on 2-photon pO 2 measurements around diving arterioles and applied this method to estimate baseline CMRO 2 in awake mice across cortical layers. To our surprise, our results revealed a decrease in baseline CMRO 2 from layer I to layer IV . This decrease of CMRO 2 with cortical depth was paralleled by an increase in tissue oxygenation. Higher baseline oxygenation and cytochrome density in layer IV may serve as an O 2 reserve during surges of neuronal activity or certain metabolically active brain states rather than baseline energy needs. Our study provides the first quantification of microscopically resolved CMRO 2 across cortical layers as a step towards informed interpretation and modeling of cortical-layer-specific Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down predictions of visual features dynamically reverse their bottom-up processing in the occipito-ventral pathway to facilitate stimulus disambiguation and behavior</a></h4>

              
                The prevalent conception of vision-for-categorization suggests an interplay of two dynamic flows of information within the occipito-ventral pathway. The bottom-up flow progressively reduces the high-dimensional input into a lower-dimensional representation that is compared with memory to produce categorization behavior. The top-down flow predicts category information (i.e. features) from memory that propagates down the same hierarchy to facilitate input processing and behavior. However, the neural mechanisms that support such dynamic feature propagation up and down the visual hierarchy and how they facilitate behavior remain unclear. Here, we studied them using a prediction experiment that cued participants (N = 11) to the spatial location (left vs. right) and spatial frequency (SF, Low, LSF, vs. High, HSF) contents of an upcoming Gabor patch. Using concurrent MEG recordings of each participant's neural activity, we compared the top-down flow of representation of the predicted Gabor contents (i.e. left vs. right; LSF vs. HSF) to their bottom-up flow. We show (1) that top-down prediction improves speed of categorization in all participants, (2) the top-down flow of prediction reverses the bottom-up representation of the Gabor stimuli, going from deep right fusiform gyrus sources down to occipital cortex sources contra-lateral to the expected Gabor location and (3) that predicted Gabors are better represented when the stimulus is eventually shown, leading to faster categorizations. Our results therefore trace the dynamic top-down flow of a predicted visual content that chronologically and hierarchically reversed bottom-up processing, further facilitates visual representations in early visual cortex and subsequent categorization behavior.

	<p>Aims: To introduce a resource supporting research on Gulf War illness (GWI) and related disorders, the Gulf War Veterans’ Illnesses Biorepository (GWVIB). Methods: Gulf War era veterans (GWVs) are recruited nationally and enrolled via telephone and email/postal mail. Enrolled veterans receive annual telephone and mail follow-up to collect health data until their passing. A postmortem neuropathological examination is performed, and fixed and frozen brain and spinal cord samples are banked to support research. Investigators studying GWI and related disorders may request tissue and data from the GWVIB. Results: As of September 2021, 127 GWVs from 39 states were enrolled; 60 met the criteria for GWI, and 14 met the criteria for chronic multisymptom illness (CMI). Enrollees have been followed up to six years. Postmortem tissue recoveries were performed on 14 GWVs. The most commonly found neuropathologies included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Lewy body disease. Tissue was of good quality with an average RNA integrity number of 5.8 (SD = 1.0) and ≥4.8 in all of the cases. Discussion: The availability of health data and high-quality CNS tissue from this well-characterized GWV cohort will support research on GWI and related disorders affecting GWVs. Enrollment is ongoing.</p>

	<p>Background: The data on neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients has been rapidly increasing throughout the pandemic. However, data on CNS and PNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 with respect to CSF, serum and neuroimaging markers is still lacking. Methods: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords “SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication”, “SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication” and “SARS-CoV-2 and PNS Complication” looking for transverse myelitis, vasculitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis (AHNE), cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), published between 1 December 2019 to 15 July 2021. Results: Of the included 106 CNS manifestations in our study, CNS inflammatory disorders included transverse myelitis (17, 14.7%), AHNE (12, 10.4%), ADEM (11, 9.5%), CLOCC/MERS (10, 8.6%) and vasculitis (4, 3.4%). Others were nonspecific encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures and stroke. Most patients were &amp;amp;gt;50 years old (75, 70.8%) and male (64, 65.3%). Most (59, 63.4%) were severe cases of COVID-19 and 18 (18%) patients died. Of the included 94 PNS manifestations in our study, GBS (89, 92.7%) was the most common. Most of these patients were &amp;amp;gt;50 years old (73, 77.7%) and male (59, 64.1%). Most (62, 67.4%) were non-severe cases of COVID-19, and ten patients died. Conclusion: Our comprehensive review of the clinical and paraclinical findings in CNS and PNS manifestations of COVID-19 provide insights on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurotropism. The higher frequency and severity of CNS manifestations should be noted by physicians for increased vigilance in particular COVID-19 cases.</p>

	<p>Pathological repetitive behaviours are a common feature of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including compulsions in obsessive–compulsive disorder or tics in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Clinical research suggests that compulsive-like symptoms are related to associative cortico-striatal dysfunctions, and tic-like symptoms to sensorimotor cortico-striatal dysfunctions. The Sapap3 knockout mouse (Sapap3-KO), the current reference model to study such repetitive behaviours, presents both associative as well as sensorimotor cortico-striatal dysfunctions. Previous findings point to deficits in both macro-, as well as micro-circuitry, both of which can be affected by neuronal structural changes. However, to date, structural connectivity has not been analysed. Hence, in the present study, we conducted a comprehensive structural characterisation of both associative and sensorimotor striatum as well as major cortical areas connecting onto these regions. Besides a thorough immunofluorescence study on oligodendrocytes, we applied AxonDeepSeg, an open source software, to automatically segment and characterise myelin thickness and axon area. We found that axon calibre, the main contributor to changes in conduction speed, is specifically reduced in the associative striatum of the Sapap3-KO mouse; myelination per se seems unaffected in associative and sensorimotor cortico-striatal circuits.</p>

	<p>Amyloid precursor protein and its derivates represent a central factor in the process of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since mental illnesses share with AD cognitive impairment, amyloid indicators have been used to explore the unknown pathophysiologic mechanisms underlining psychiatric illness. This work aims to compare the role of amyloid markers, together with tau proteins, among various mental disorders evaluating the possible role of altered amyloid metabolism in the onset and in the course of psychiatric diseases, considering the relationship with cognitive impairment in dementia. This review includes articles written in English, published between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2021, which evaluated amyloid and tau proteins in psychiatric patients. After screening, 31 studies were included in the review. Results suggest that amyloid metabolism is altered in major psychiatric disorders and that it could be a marker of cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the role of amyloid in mental diseases seems to be related to neurodevelopmental alteration as well as neurodegeneration processes, like in AD. The role of amyloid in the pathogenesis of mental disorders is still unknown. Amyloid should not be only considered as a marker of cognitive impairment in mental illness, but also for altered neurodevelopment.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this article was to systematically review and organise the available literature devoted to the topic of depressive symptoms and burnout in football players. A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, SPORTdiscus, PubMed, and Psychinfo for articles published up to June 2020. The searches yielded 1589 articles, and after the screening process, a total of 18 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for review. Playing position and conflicts with coach/management seems to have a direct influence on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in current players as do the injuries and life events of former players. During the pre-competition phase, most of the athletes displayed reduced rates, indicating burnout. An exploration of the mental health of football players will help to create models of care and guide professionals so that they may help players achieve better performance while also having better wellbeing. Understanding how to prevent and cope with the emotional wellbeing of football players will be possible to guide players and coaches.</p>

	<p>Background: Impairment in navigation abilities and object location memory are often seen in early-stage Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), yet these constructs are not included in standard neuropsychological assessment. We investigated the differential ability of a short digital spatial memory test in mild AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: 21 patients with AD dementia (66.9 ± 6.9; 47% female), 22 patients with MCI (69.6 ± 8.3; 46% female) and 21 patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (62.2 ± 8.9; 48% female) from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort performed the Object Location Memory Test (OLMT), consisting of a visual perception and memory trial, and the Virtual Tübingen (VT) test, consisting of a scene recognition, route continuation, route ordering and distance comparison task. The correlations with other cognitive domains were examined. Results: Patients with mild AD dementia (Z: −2.51 ± 1.15) and MCI (Z: −1.81 ± 0.92) performed worse than participants with SCD (Z: 0.0 ± 1.0) on the OLMT. Scene recognition and route continuation were equally impaired in patients with AD dementia (Z: −1.14 ± 0.73; Z: −1.44 ± 1.13) and MCI (Z: −1.37 ± 1.25; Z: −1.21 ± 1.07). Route ordering was only impaired in patients with MCI (Z: −0.82 ± 0.78). Weak to moderate correlations were found between route continuation and memory (r(64) = 0.40, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and between route ordering and attention (r(64) = 0.33, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but not for the OLMT. Conclusion: A short digital spatial memory test battery was able to detect object location memory and navigation impairment in patients with mild AD dementia and MCI, highlighting the value of incorporating such a test battery in standard neuropsychological assessment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">No Evidence for Neural Overlap between Unconsciously Processed and Imagined Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual representations can be generated via feedforward or feedback processes. The extent to which these processes result in overlapping representations remains unclear. Previous work has shown that imagined stimuli elicit similar representations as perceived stimuli throughout the visual cortex. However, while representations during imagery are indeed only caused by feedback processing, neural processing during perception is an interplay of both feedforward and feedback processing. This means that any representational overlap could be because of overlap in feedback processes. In the current study, we aimed to investigate this issue by characterizing the overlap between feedforward- and feedback-initiated category representations during imagined stimuli, conscious perception, and unconscious processing using fMRI in humans of either sex. While all three conditions elicited stimulus representations in left lateral occipital cortex (LOC), significant similarities were observed only between imagery and conscious perception in this area. Furthermore, connectivity analyses revealed stronger connectivity between frontal areas and left LOC during conscious perception and in imagery compared with unconscious processing. Together, these findings can be explained by the idea that long-range feedback modifies visual representations, thereby reducing representational overlap between purely feedforward- and feedback-initiated stimulus representations measured by fMRI. Neural representations influenced by feedback, either stimulus driven (perception) or purely internally driven (imagery), are, however, relatively similar.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Knee joint trauma can cause an osteochondral defect (OD), a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and cause of debilitating pain in patients. Rodent OD models are less translatable because of their smaller joint size and open growth plate. This study proposes sheep as a translationally relevant model to understand the neuronal basis of OD pain. A unilateral 6-mm deep OD was induced in adult female sheep. Two to six weeks after operation, lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons were collected from the contralateral (Ctrl) and OD side of operated sheep. Functional assessment of neuronal excitability and activity of the pain-related ion channels transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) and P2X3 was conducted using electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify expression of pain-related proteins. We observed that an increased proportion of OD DRG neurons (sheep, <I>N</I> = 3; Ctrl neurons, <I>n</I> = 15, OD neurons, <I>n</I> = 16) showed spontaneous electrical excitability (Ctrl: 20.33 &plusmn; 4.5%; OD: 50 &plusmn; 10%; <I>p</I> = 0.009, unpaired <I>t</I> test) and an increased proportion fired a greater number of spikes above baseline in response to application of a TRPV1 agonist (capsaicin) application (Ctrl: 40%; OD: 75%; <I>p</I> = 0.04, <sup>2</sup> test). Capsaicin also produced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in an increased proportion of isolated OD DRG neurons (Ctrl: 25%; OD: 44%; <I>p</I> = 0.001, <sup>2</sup> test). Neither protein expression, nor functionality of the P2X3 ion channel were altered in OD neurons. Overall, we provide evidence of increased excitability of DRG neurons (an important neural correlate of pain) and TRPV1 function in an OD sheep model. Our data show that functional assessment of sheep DRG neurons can provide important insights into the neural basis of OD pain and thus potentially prevent its progression into arthritic pain.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to adapt under significant adversity, defined as psychological resilience, is instrumental in preventing stress-related disorders. An important aspect of resilience is the capacity to endure affective distress when in pursuit of goals, also known as distress tolerance. Evidence that links intrinsic baseline interactions within large-scale functional networks with performance under distress remains missing. We hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may engage in distress tolerance because of its involvement in attention and emotion regulation. Accordingly, we tested whether behavioral performance under distress is associated with baseline resting-state ACC functional connectivity (FC). Distress tolerance was measured in 97 participants using the behavioral indicator of resiliency to distress (BIRD) task. Analyses contrasted participants who quit the task before its designated termination (<I>n</I> = 51) with those who persisted throughout it (<I>n</I> = 46). Seed-based FC analysis indicated greater connectivity between the ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in subjects who persisted throughout the task, along with greater FC between the ACC and the precentral gyrus in those who quit before its termination. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying interindividual differences in the ability to handle distress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Unbalanced Regulation of {alpha}7 nAChRs by Ly6h and NACHO Contributes to Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely expressed in the brain where they promote fast cholinergic synaptic transmission and serve important neuromodulatory functions. However, their high permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> also predisposes them to contribute to disease states. Here, using transfected HEK-tsa cells and primary cultured hippocampal neurons from male and female rats, we demonstrate that two proteins called Ly6h and NACHO compete for access to &alpha;7 subunits, operating together but in opposition to maintain &alpha;7 assembly and activity within a narrow range that is optimal for neuronal function and viability. Using mixed gender human temporal cortex and cultured hippocampal neurons from rats we further show that this balance is perturbed during Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of amyloid &beta; (A&beta;)-driven reduction in Ly6h, with severe reduction leading to increased phosphorylated tau and &alpha;7-mediated neurotoxicity. Ly6h release into human CSF is also correlated with AD severity. Thus, Ly6h links cholinergic signaling, A&beta; and phosphorylated tau and may serve as a novel marker for AD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the earliest and most persistent hypotheses regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributes cognitive impairment to loss of cholinergic signaling. More recently, interest has focused on crucial roles for amyloid &beta; (A&beta;) and phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that these elements are linked by Ly6h and its counterpart, NACHO, functioning in opposition to maintain assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) within the physiological range. Our data suggests that A&beta; shifts the balance away from Ly6h and toward NACHO, resulting in increased assembly of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable nAChRs and thus a conversion of basal cholinergic to neurotoxic signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Constitutive Phosphorylation as a Key Regulator of TRPM8 Channel Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>In mammals, environmental cold sensing conducted by peripheral cold thermoreceptor neurons mostly depends on TRPM8, an ion channel that has evolved to become the main molecular cold transducer. This TRP channel is activated by cold, cooling compounds, such as menthol, voltage, and rises in osmolality. TRPM8 function is regulated by kinase activity that phosphorylates the channel under resting conditions. However, which specific residues, how this post-translational modification modulates TRPM8 activity, and its influence on cold sensing are still poorly understood. By mass spectrometry, we identified four serine residues within the N-terminus (S26, S29, S541, and S542) constitutively phosphorylated in the mouse ortholog. TRPM8 function was examined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and patch-clamp recordings, revealing that treatment with staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor, augmented its cold- and menthol-evoked responses. S29A mutation is sufficient to increase TRPM8 activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is a central molecular determinant of this negative regulation. Biophysical and total internal reflection fluorescence-based analysis revealed a dual mechanism in the potentiated responses of unphosphorylated TRPM8: a shift in the voltage activation curve toward more negative potentials and an increase in the number of active channels at the plasma membrane. Importantly, basal kinase activity negatively modulates TRPM8 function at cold thermoreceptors from male and female mice, an observation accounted for by mathematical modeling. Overall, our findings suggest that cold temperature detection could be rapidly and reversibly fine-tuned by controlling the TRPM8 basal phosphorylation state, a mechanism that acts as a dynamic molecular brake of this thermo-TRP channel function in primary sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Post-translational modifications are one of the main molecular mechanisms involved in adjusting the sensitivity of sensory ion channels to changing environmental conditions. Here we show, for the first time, that constitutive phosphorylation of the well-conserved serine 29 within the N-terminal domain negatively modulates TRPM8 channel activity, reducing its activation by agonists and decreasing the number of active channels at the plasma membrane. Basal phosphorylation of TRPM8 acts as a key regulator of its function as the main cold-transduction channel, significantly contributing to the net response of primary sensory neurons to temperature reductions. This reversible and dynamic modulatory mechanism opens new opportunities to regulate TRPM8 function in pathologic conditions where this thermo-TRP channel plays a critical role.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">In Vivo Calcium Imaging Visualizes Incision-Induced Primary Afferent Sensitization and Its Amelioration by Capsaicin Pretreatment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies have shown that infiltration of capsaicin into the surgical site can prevent incision-induced spontaneous pain like behaviors and heat hyperalgesia. In the present study, we aimed to monitor primary sensory neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the intact dorsal root ganglia (DRG) using Pirt-GCaMP3 male and female mice pretreated with capsaicin or vehicle before the plantar incision. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (0.05%) significantly attenuated spontaneous pain, mechanical, and heat hypersensitivity after plantar incision. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in <I>in vivo</I> DRG and in <I>in situ</I> spinal cord was significantly enhanced in the ipsilateral side compared with contralateral side or naive control. Primary sensory nerve fiber length was significantly decreased in the incision skin area in capsaicin-pretreated animals detected by immunohistochemistry and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) staining. Thus, capsaicin pretreatment attenuates incisional pain by suppressing Ca<sup>2+</sup> response because of degeneration of primary sensory nerve fibers in the skin.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Postoperative surgery pain is a major health and economic problem worldwide with ~235 million major surgical procedures annually. Approximately 50% of these patients report uncontrolled or poorly controlled postoperative pain. However, mechanistic studies of postoperative surgery pain in primary sensory neurons have been limited to <I>in vitro</I> models or small numbers of neurons. Using an innovative, distinctive, and interdisciplinary <I>in vivo</I> populational dorsal root ganglia (DRG) imaging (&gt;1800 neurons/DRG) approach, we revealed increased DRG neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity from postoperative pain mouse model. This indicates widespread DRG primary sensory neuron plasticity. Increased neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity occurs among various sizes of neurons but mostly in small-diameter and medium-diameter nociceptors. Capsaicin pretreatment as a therapeutic option significantly attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and postoperative pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Retinal Ganglion Cell Axon Regeneration Requires Complement and Myeloid Cell Activity within the Optic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <p>Axon regenerative failure in the mature CNS contributes to functional deficits following many traumatic injuries, ischemic injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases. The complement cascade of the innate immune system responds to pathogen threat through inflammatory cell activation, pathogen opsonization, and pathogen lysis, and complement is also involved in CNS development, neuroplasticity, injury, and disease. Here, we investigated the involvement of the classical complement cascade and microglia/monocytes in CNS repair using the mouse optic nerve injury (ONI) model, in which axons arising from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are disrupted. We report that central complement C3 protein and mRNA, classical complement C1q protein and mRNA, and microglia/monocyte phagocytic complement receptor CR3 all increase in response to ONI, especially within the optic nerve itself. Importantly, genetic deletion of <I>C1q</I>, <I>C3</I>, or <I>CR3</I> attenuates RGC axon regeneration induced by several distinct methods, with minimal effects on RGC survival. Local injections of C1q function-blocking antibody revealed that complement acts primarily within the optic nerve, not retina, to support regeneration. Moreover, C1q opsonizes and CR3<sup>+</sup> microglia/monocytes phagocytose growth-inhibitory myelin debris after ONI, a likely mechanism through which complement and myeloid cells support axon regeneration. Collectively, these results indicate that local optic nerve complement-myeloid phagocytic signaling is required for CNS axon regrowth, emphasizing the axonal compartment and highlighting a beneficial neuroimmune role for complement and microglia/monocytes in CNS repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the importance of achieving axon regeneration after CNS injury and the inevitability of inflammation after such injury, the contributions of complement and microglia to CNS axon regeneration are largely unknown. Whereas inflammation is commonly thought to exacerbate the effects of CNS injury, we find that complement proteins C1q and C3 and microglia/monocyte phagocytic complement receptor CR3 are each required for retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration through the injured mouse optic nerve. Also, whereas studies of optic nerve regeneration generally focus on the retina, we show that the regeneration-relevant role of complement and microglia/monocytes likely involves myelin phagocytosis within the optic nerve. Thus, our results point to the importance of the innate immune response for CNS repair.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Akt-mTOR Pathway Drives Myelin Sheath Growth by Regulating Cap-Dependent Translation</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the vertebrate CNS, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a specialized membrane, to insulate and support axons. Individual oligodendrocytes wrap multiple axons with myelin sheaths of variable lengths and thicknesses. Myelin grows at the distal ends of oligodendrocyte processes, and multiple lines of work have provided evidence that mRNAs and RNA binding proteins localize to myelin, together supporting a model where local translation controls myelin sheath growth. What signal transduction mechanisms could control this? One strong candidate is the Akt-mTOR pathway, a major cellular signaling hub that coordinates transcription, translation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization. Here, using zebrafish as a model system, we found that Akt-mTOR signaling promotes myelin sheath growth and stability during development. Through cell-specific manipulations to oligodendrocytes, we show that the Akt-mTOR pathway drives cap-dependent translation to promote myelination and that restoration of cap-dependent translation is sufficient to rescue myelin deficits in mTOR loss-of-function animals. Moreover, an mTOR-dependent translational regulator was phosphorylated and colocalized with mRNA encoding a canonically myelin-translated protein <I>in vivo</I>, and bioinformatic investigation revealed numerous putative translational targets in the myelin transcriptome. Together, these data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR signaling in nascent myelin sheaths promotes sheath growth via translation of myelin-resident mRNAs during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes extend processes that tightly wrap axons with myelin, a protein- and lipid-rich membrane that increases electrical impulses and provides trophic support. Myelin membrane grows dramatically following initial axon wrapping in a process that demands protein and lipid synthesis. How protein and lipid synthesis is coordinated with the need for myelin to be generated in certain locations remains unknown. Our study reveals that the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway promotes myelin sheath growth by regulating protein translation. Because we found translational regulators of the Akt-mTOR pathway in myelin, our data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR activity regulates translation in myelin sheaths to deliver myelin on demand to the places it is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Optogenetic Activation of V1 Interneurons Reveals the Multimodality of Spinal Locomotor Networks in the Neonatal Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the spinal cord, classes of interneurons have been studied <I>in vitro</I> to determine their role in producing or regulating locomotion. It is unclear whether all locomotor behaviors are produced by the same circuitry or engage different subsets of neurons. Here, in neonatal mice of either sex, we test this idea by comparing the actions of a class of spinal, inhibitory interneuron (V1) expressing channelrhodopsin driven by the <I>engrailed-1</I> transcription factor on the rhythms elicited by different methods. We find that, although the overall locomotor activities <I>in vitro</I> are similar, V1 interneuron depolarization produces opposite effects depending of the mode of activation of the locomotor circuitry. The differential behavior of V1 neurons suggests that their function depends on how the locomotor rhythm is activated and is consistent with the idea that the functional organization of the corresponding locomotor networks also differs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neural networks dictating the execution of fictive locomotion are located in the spinal cord. It is generally assumed that the mode of activation of these spinal networks should not change the recruitment or function of neurons. Here, we manipulated the activity of a class of interneuron (V1), which targets these networks and found that their activation induces opposite effects depending on the mode of activation. This suggests that the mode of activation of the spinal networks differentially recruits either V1 interneurons or other interneurons, or both.</p>

                <p>The timing and quality of sleep-wake cycles are regulated by interacting circadian and homeostatic mechanisms. Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal clock, circadian clocks are active across the brain and the respective sleep-regulatory roles of SCN and local clocks are unclear. To determine the specific contribution(s) of the SCN, we used virally mediated genetic complementation, expressing Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) to establish circadian molecular competence in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus of globally clockless, arrhythmic male <I>Cry1/Cry2</I>-null mice. Under free-running conditions, the rest/activity behavior of <I>Cry1/Cry2</I>-null controls expressing EGFP (SCN<sup>Con</sup>) was arrhythmic, whereas Cry1-complemented mice (SCN<sup>Cry1</sup>) had coherent circadian behavior, comparable to that of Cry1,2-competent wild types (WTs). In SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice, sleep-wakefulness, assessed by electroencephalography (EEG)/electromyography (EMG), lacked circadian organization. In SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice, however, it matched WTs, with consolidated vigilance states [wake, rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS (NREMS)] and rhythms in NREMS  power and expression of REMS within total sleep (TS). Wakefulness in SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice was more fragmented than in WTs, with more wake-NREMS-wake transitions. This disruption was reversed in SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice. Following sleep deprivation (SD), all mice showed a homeostatic increase in NREMS  power, although the SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice had reduced NREMS during the inactive (light) phase of recovery. In contrast, the dynamics of homeostatic responses in the SCN<sup>Cry1</sup> mice were comparable to WTs. Finally, SCN<sup>Con</sup> mice exhibited poor sleep-dependent memory but this was corrected in SCN<sup>Cry1</sup>mice. In clockless mice, circadian molecular competence focused solely on the SCN rescued the architecture and consolidation of sleep-wake and sleep-dependent memory, highlighting its dominant role in timing sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circadian timing system regulates sleep-wake cycles. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock, but the presence of multiple local brain and peripheral clocks mean the respective roles of SCN and other clocks in regulating sleep are unclear. We therefore used virally mediated genetic complementation to restore molecular circadian functions in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus, focusing on the SCN, in otherwise genetically clockless, arrhythmic mice. This initiated circadian activity-rest cycles, and circadian sleep-wake cycles, circadian patterning to the intensity of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and circadian control of REMS as a proportion of total sleep (TS). Consolidation of sleep-wake established normal dynamics of sleep homeostasis and enhanced sleep-dependent memory. Thus, the suprachiasmatic hypothalamus, alone, can direct circadian regulation of sleep-wake.</p>

                <p>Neuronal ensembles are groups of neurons with coordinated activity that could represent sensory, motor, or cognitive states. The study of how neuronal ensembles are built, recalled, and involved in the guiding of complex behaviors has been limited by the lack of experimental and analytical tools to reliably identify and manipulate neurons that have the ability to activate entire ensembles. Such pattern completion neurons have also been proposed as key elements of artificial and biological neural networks. Indeed, the relevance of pattern completion neurons is highlighted by growing evidence that targeting them can activate neuronal ensembles and trigger behavior. As a method to reliably detect pattern completion neurons, we use conditional random fields (CRFs), a type of probabilistic graphical model. We apply CRFs to identify pattern completion neurons in ensembles in experiments using <I>in vivo</I> two-photon calcium imaging from primary visual cortex of male mice and confirm the CRFs predictions with two-photon optogenetics. To test the broader applicability of CRFs we also analyze publicly available calcium imaging data (Allen Institute Brain Observatory dataset) and demonstrate that CRFs can reliably identify neurons that predict specific features of visual stimuli. Finally, to explore the scalability of CRFs we apply them to <I>in silico</I> network simulations and show that CRFs-identified pattern completion neurons have increased functional connectivity. These results demonstrate the potential of CRFs to characterize and selectively manipulate neural circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We describe a graph theory method to identify and optically manipulate neurons with pattern completion capability in mouse cortical circuits. Using calcium imaging and two-photon optogenetics <I>in vivo</I> we confirm that key neurons identified by this method can recall entire neuronal ensembles. This method could be broadly applied to manipulate neuronal ensemble activity to trigger behavior or for therapeutic applications in brain prostheses.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Refinement of Kinematic Variability in Huntington Disease Mice on an Automated Home Cage Forelimb Motor Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>The effective development of novel therapies in mouse models of neurologic disorders relies on behavioral assessments that provide accurate read-outs of neuronal dysfunction and/or degeneration. We designed an automated behavioral testing system (PiPaw), which integrates an operant lever-pulling task directly into the mouse home cage. This task is accessible to group-housed mice 24 h per day, enabling high-throughput longitudinal analysis of forelimb motor learning. Moreover, this design eliminates the need for exposure to novel environments and minimizes experimenter interaction, significantly reducing two of the largest stressors associated with animal behavior. Male mice improved their performance of this task over 1 week of testing by reducing intertrial variability of reward-related kinematic parameters (pull amplitude or peak velocity). In addition, mice displayed short-term improvements in reward rate, and a concomitant decrease in movement variability, over the course of brief bouts of task engagement. We used this system to assess motor learning in mouse models of the inherited neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington disease (HD). Despite having no baseline differences in task performance, male <I>Q175-FDN</I> HD mice were unable to modulate the variability of their movements to increase reward on either short or long timescales. Task training was associated with a decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory activity recorded from striatal medium spiny neurons in the hemisphere contralateral to the trained forelimb in WT mice; however, no such changes were observed in <I>Q175-FDN</I> mice. This behavioral screening platform should prove useful for preclinical drug trials toward improved treatments in HD and other neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In order to develop effective therapies for neurologic disorders, such as Huntington disease (HD), it is important to be able to accurately and reliably assess the behavior of mouse models of these conditions. Moreover, these behavioral assessments should provide an accurate readout of underlying neuronal dysfunction and/or degeneration. In this paper, we used an automated behavioral testing system to assess motor learning in mice within their home cage. Using this system, we were able to study motor abnormalities in HD mice with an unprecedented level of detail, and identified a specific behavioral deficit associated with an underlying impairment in striatal neuronal plasticity. These results validate the usefulness of this system for assessing behavior in mouse models of HD and other neurologic disorders.</p>

                <p>How do we attend to relevant auditory information in complex naturalistic scenes? Much research has focused on detecting which information is attended, without regarding underlying top-down control mechanisms. Studies investigating attentional control generally manipulate and cue specific features in simple stimuli. However, in naturalistic scenes it is impossible to dissociate relevant from irrelevant information based on low-level features. Instead, the brain has to parse and select auditory objects of interest. The neural underpinnings of object-based auditory attention remain not well understood. Here we recorded MEG while 15 healthy human subjects (9 female) prepared for the repetition of an auditory object presented in one of two overlapping naturalistic auditory streams. The stream containing the repetition was prospectively cued with 70% validity. Crucially, this task could not be solved by attending low-level features, but only by processing the objects fully. We trained a linear classifier on the cortical distribution of source-reconstructed oscillatory activity to distinguish which auditory stream was attended. We could successfully classify the attended stream from alpha (8&ndash;14 Hz) activity in anticipation of repetition onset. Importantly, attention could only be classified from trials in which subjects subsequently detected the repetition, but not from miss trials. Behavioral relevance was further supported by a correlation between classification accuracy and detection performance. Decodability was not sustained throughout stimulus presentation, but peaked shortly before repetition onset, suggesting that attention acted transiently according to temporal expectations. We thus demonstrate anticipatory alpha oscillations to underlie top-down control of object-based auditory attention in complex naturalistic scenes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In everyday life, we often find ourselves bombarded with auditory information, from which we need to select what is relevant to our current goals. Previous research has highlighted how we attend to specific highly controlled aspects of the auditory input. Although invaluable, it is still unclear how this relates to attentional control in naturalistic auditory scenes. Here we used the high precision of magnetoencephalography in space and time to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying top-down control of object-based attention in ecologically valid sound scenes. We show that rhythmic activity in auditory association cortex at a frequency of ~10 Hz (alpha waves) controls attention to currently relevant segments within the auditory scene and predicts whether these segments are subsequently detected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Cortex Causally Contributes to Vocabulary Translation following Sensorimotor-Enriched Training</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of the motor cortex in perceptual and cognitive functions is highly controversial. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the motor cortex can be instrumental for translating foreign language vocabulary. Human participants of both sexes were trained on foreign language (L2) words and their native language translations over 4 consecutive days. L2 words were accompanied by complementary gestures (sensorimotor enrichment) or pictures (sensory enrichment). Following training, participants translated the auditorily presented L2 words that they had learned. During translation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied bilaterally to a site within the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) located in the vicinity of the arm functional compartment. Responses within the stimulated motor region have previously been found to correlate with behavioral benefits of sensorimotor-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Compared to sham stimulation, effective perturbation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation slowed down the translation of sensorimotor-enriched L2 words, but not sensory-enriched L2 words. This finding suggests that sensorimotor-enriched training induced changes in L2 representations within the motor cortex, which in turn facilitated the translation of L2 words. The motor cortex may play a causal role in precipitating sensorimotor-based learning benefits, and may directly aid in remembering the native language translations of foreign language words following sensorimotor-enriched training. These findings support multisensory theories of learning while challenging reactivation-based theories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the potential for sensorimotor enrichment to serve as a powerful tool for learning in many domains, its underlying brain mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation and a foreign language (L2) learning paradigm, we found that sensorimotor-enriched training can induce changes in L2 representations within the motor cortex, which in turn causally facilitate the translation of L2 words. The translation of recently acquired L2 words may therefore rely not only on auditory information stored in memory or on modality-independent L2 representations, but also on the sensorimotor context in which the words have been experienced.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitatory Contribution to Binocular Interactions in Human Visual Cortex Is Reduced in Strabismic Amblyopia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Binocular summation in strabismic amblyopia is typically reported as being absent or greatly reduced in behavioral studies and is thought to be because of a preferential loss of excitatory interactions between the eyes. Here, we studied how excitatory and suppressive interactions contribute to binocular contrast interactions along the visual cortical hierarchy of humans with strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia in both sexes, using source-imaged steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) over a wide range of relative contrast between the two eyes. Dichoptic parallel grating stimuli modulated at unique temporal frequencies in each eye allowed us to quantify spectral response components associated with monocular inputs (self-terms) and the response components because of interaction of the inputs of the two eyes [intermodulation (IM) terms]. Although anisometropic amblyopes revealed a similar pattern of responses to normal-vision observers, strabismic amblyopes exhibited substantially reduced IM responses across cortical regions of interest (V1, V3a, hV4, hMT+ and lateral occipital cortex), indicating reduced interocular interactions in visual cortex. A contrast gain control model that simultaneously fits self- and IM-term responses within each cortical area revealed different patterns of binocular interactions between individuals with normal and disrupted binocularity. Our model fits show that in strabismic amblyopia, the excitatory contribution to binocular interactions is significantly reduced in both V1 and extra-striate cortex, whereas suppressive contributions remain intact. Our results provide robust electrophysiological evidence supporting the view that disruption of binocular interactions in strabismus or amblyopia is because of preferential loss of excitatory interactions between the eyes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We studied how excitatory and suppressive interactions contribute to binocular contrast interactions along the visual cortical hierarchy of humans with normal and amblyopic vision, using source-imaged SSVEP and frequency-domain analysis of dichoptic stimuli over a wide range of relative contrast between the two eyes. A dichoptic contrast gain control model was used to characterize these interactions in amblyopia and provided a quantitative comparison to normal vision. Our model fits revealed different patterns of binocular interactions between normal and amblyopic vision. Strabismic amblyopia significantly reduced excitatory contributions to binocular interactions, whereas suppressive contributions remained intact.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Critical Role of Astrocyte NAD+ Glycohydrolase in Myelin Injury and Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Western-style diets cause disruptions in myelinating cells and astrocytes within the mouse CNS. Increased CD38 expression is present in the cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models of demyelination and CD38 is the main nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-depleting enzyme in the CNS. Altered NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism is linked to both high fat consumption and multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we identify increased CD38 expression in the male mouse spinal cord following chronic high fat consumption, after focal toxin [lysolecithin (LL)]-mediated demyelinating injury, and in reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD38 catalytically inactive mice are substantially protected from high fat-induced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, oligodendrocyte loss, oxidative damage, and astrogliosis. A CD38 inhibitor, 78c, increased NAD<sup>+</sup> and attenuated neuroinflammatory changes induced by saturated fat applied to astrocyte cultures. Conditioned media from saturated fat-exposed astrocytes applied to oligodendrocyte cultures impaired myelin protein production, suggesting astrocyte-driven indirect mechanisms of oligodendrogliopathy. In cerebellar organotypic slice cultures subject to LL-demyelination, saturated fat impaired signs of remyelination effects that were mitigated by concomitant 78c treatment. Significantly, oral 78c increased counts of oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons after focal LL-induced spinal cord demyelination. Using a RiboTag approach, we identified a unique <I>in vivo</I> brain astrocyte translatome profile induced by 78c-mediated CD38 inhibition in mice, including decreased expression of proinflammatory astrocyte markers and increased growth factors. Our findings suggest that a high-fat diet impairs oligodendrocyte survival and differentiation through astrocyte-linked mechanisms mediated by the NAD<sup>+</sup>ase CD38 and highlights CD38 inhibitors as potential therapeutic candidates to improve myelin regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin disturbances and oligodendrocyte loss can leave axons vulnerable, leading to permanent neurologic deficits. The results of this study suggest that metabolic disturbances, triggered by consumption of a diet high in fat, promote oligodendrogliopathy and impair myelin regeneration through astrocyte-linked indirect nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-dependent mechanisms. We demonstrate that restoring NAD<sup>+</sup> levels via genetic inactivation of CD38 can overcome these effects. Moreover, we show that therapeutic inactivation of CD38 can enhance myelin regeneration. Together, these findings point to a new metabolic targeting strategy positioned to improve disease course in multiple sclerosis and other conditions in which the integrity of myelin is a key concern.</p>

                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the revealing manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts as probiotics on the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune responses of broiler: A meta-analysis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The number of publications in Scopus on this topic increased from less than 50 in 1995 to more than 250 in 2015. In other hand, inconsistency in results about the correlation between yeast and lactic acid bacteria as probiotics has been evident since the early publications on use in broilers. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine relationship between lactic acid bacteria and yeast as probiotics to broiler diets on the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.  A database was designed based on published data that reported the use of probiotics on the broiler. The method used for selecting articles was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. Articles selected were taken from PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science direct databases as well as individual. Results: The final database consists of 49 in vivo articles, 93 studies, and 225 treatments. The analysis statement in the system was a PROC MIXED procedure of SAS software. The level of probiotic increased (p <0.001) body weight, body weight gain, and feed intake of broiler. There was a reduction (p <0.01) on feed conversion ratio and mortality on the level probiotic given to broiler. Supplementation of probiotics in broiler diet increased (p <0.001) the weight of liver, spleen, gizzard, bursa of fabricius and carcass yield, while reduced (p<0.001) abdominal fat weight. The probiotic given increased the total of red and white blood cells (both at p < 0.001) but did not affect lymphocyte.  Discussion: It can be concluded the yeast act as supporting agent that serves lactic acid bacteria as probiotic increases the growth performance, relative organ weight, blood parameters, and immune response of the broiler.

                <p>by Michael Pan, Peter J. Gawthrop, Joseph Cursons, Edmund J. Crampin</p>

It is widely acknowledged that the construction of large-scale dynamic models in systems biology requires complex modelling problems to be broken up into more manageable pieces. To this end, both modelling and software frameworks are required to enable modular modelling. While there has been consistent progress in the development of software tools to enhance model reusability, there has been a relative lack of consideration for how underlying biophysical principles can be applied to this space. Bond graphs combine the aspects of both modularity and physics-based modelling. In this paper, we argue that bond graphs are compatible with recent developments in modularity and abstraction in systems biology, and are thus a desirable framework for constructing large-scale models. We use two examples to illustrate the utility of bond graphs in this context: a model of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade to illustrate the reusability of modules and a model of glycolysis to illustrate the ability to modify the model granularity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Steady-state measures of visual suppression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel H. Baker, Greta Vilidaite, Alex R. Wade</p>

In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The novel anti-CRISPR AcrIIA22 relieves DNA torsion in target plasmids and impairs SpyCas9 activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin J. Forsberg, Danica T. Schmidtke, Rachel Werther, Ruben V. Uribe, Deanna Hausman, Morten O. A. Sommer, Barry L. Stoddard, Brett K. Kaiser, Harmit S. Malik</p>

To overcome CRISPR-Cas defense systems, many phages and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) encode CRISPR-Cas inhibitors called anti-CRISPRs (Acrs). Nearly all characterized Acrs directly bind Cas proteins to inactivate CRISPR immunity. Here, using functional metagenomic selection, we describe AcrIIA22, an unconventional Acr found in hypervariable genomic regions of clostridial bacteria and their prophages from human gut microbiomes. AcrIIA22 does not bind strongly to SpyCas9 but nonetheless potently inhibits its activity against plasmids. To gain insight into its mechanism, we obtained an X-ray crystal structure of AcrIIA22, which revealed homology to PC4-like nucleic acid–binding proteins. Based on mutational analyses and functional assays, we deduced that <i>acrIIA22</i> encodes a DNA nickase that relieves torsional stress in supercoiled plasmids. This may render them less susceptible to SpyCas9, which uses free energy from negative supercoils to form stable R-loops. Modifying DNA topology may provide an additional route to CRISPR-Cas resistance in phages and MGEs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Plasmid fitness costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts enabling resolution by compensatory mutation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James P. J. Hall, Rosanna C. T. Wright, Ellie Harrison, Katie J. Muddiman, A. Jamie Wood, Steve Paterson, Michael A. Brockhurst</p>

Plasmids play an important role in bacterial genome evolution by transferring genes between lineages. Fitness costs associated with plasmid carriage are expected to be a barrier to gene exchange, but the causes of plasmid fitness costs are poorly understood. Single compensatory mutations are often sufficient to completely ameliorate plasmid fitness costs, suggesting that such costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts rather than generic properties of plasmids, such as their size, metabolic burden, or gene expression level. By combining the results of experimental evolution with genetics and transcriptomics, we show here that fitness costs of 2 divergent large plasmids in <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> are caused by inducing maladaptive expression of a chromosomal tailocin toxin operon. Mutations in single genes unrelated to the toxin operon, and located on either the chromosome or the plasmid, ameliorated the disruption associated with plasmid carriage. We identify one of these compensatory loci, the chromosomal gene <i>PFLU4242</i>, as the key mediator of the fitness costs of both plasmids, with the other compensatory loci either reducing expression of this gene or mitigating its deleterious effects by up-regulating a putative plasmid-borne ParAB operon. The chromosomal mobile genetic element Tn6291, which uses plasmids for transmission, remained up-regulated even in compensated strains, suggesting that mobile genetic elements communicate through pathways independent of general physiological disruption. Plasmid fitness costs caused by specific genetic conflicts are unlikely to act as a long-term barrier to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) due to their propensity for amelioration by single compensatory mutations, helping to explain why plasmids are so common in bacterial genomes.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Impact of Cardiopulmonary Bypass on Neurogenesis and Cortical Maturation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurodevelopmental delays and frontal lobe cortical dysmaturation are widespread among children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest pool of neural stem/progenitor cells in the postnatal brain. Our aim is to determine the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on neurogenesis and cortical maturation in piglets whose SVZ development is similar to human infants.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three-week-old piglets (n = 29) were randomly assigned to control (no surgery), mild-CPB (34°C full flow for 60 minutes) and severe-CPB groups (25°C circulatory-arrest for 60 minutes). The SVZ and frontal lobe were analyzed with immunohistochemistry 3 days and 4 weeks postoperatively. MRI of the frontal lobe was used to assess cortical development.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SVZ neurogenic activity was reduced up to 4 weeks after both mild and severe CPB-induced insults. CPB also induced decreased migration of young neurons to the frontal lobe, demonstrating that CPB impairs postnatal neurogenesis. MRI 4 weeks after CPB displayed a decrease in gyrification index and cortical volume of the frontal lobe. Cortical fractional anisotropy was increased after severe CPB injury, indicating a prolonged deleterious impact of CPB on cortical maturation. Both CPB-induced insults displayed a significant change in densities of three major inhibitory neurons, suggesting excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the frontal cortex. In addition, different CPB insults altered different subpopulations of inhibitory neurons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms contributing to CHD-induced neurological impairments. Further refinement of CPB hardware and techniques is necessary to improve long-term frontal cortical dysmaturation observed in children with CHD. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Survival models for right censored breast cancer data: theory, application and comparison [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Censoring frequently occurs in disease data analysis, which is a key characteristic of time to failure modeling. Typically, time to failure studies are conducted through non-parametric and semi-parametric modelling techniques. Parametric models provide more efficient estimates, but are seldomly used, because of some of the limitations and assumptions which need to be fulfilled to apply them. The aim of this study is to illustrate the theoretical and application limitations and performance of different flexible and standard parametric models to evaluate the prognostic value for mortality risk of breast cancer after recurrence among women. Methods: This article describes the theoretical properties of flexible parametric models and compares their performances to standard parametric models, by studying mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer. We describe how time to failure data may be analyzed with nonlinear flexible models. In this regard, we apply fractional polynomials, spline models, piecewise exponential models, and piecewise exponential additive mixed models. We also illustrate properties of standard parametric models. All analyses have been conducted with multiple covariates to identify significant predictors. Information criteria have been used to evaluate performances of models. Results: Fractional polynomial and spline-based generalized additive models work well in capturing local fluctuations. Parameter estimation with a piecewise exponential additive mixed model (PAMM) as an extension of the piecewise exponential modelling (PEM) approach automatically penalizes model complexity, which is very helpful to avoid over fitting. Conclusions: Flexible parametric time to failure models are more efficient than standard parametric time to failure models. By incorporating time dependent covariates, PAMM is a good approach to perform in-depth studies of predictors over different finite intervals of follow-up time. Until now, this approach is rarely used in time to failure right censored studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Applying machine learning EEG signal classification to emotion‑related brain anticipatory activity [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning approaches have been fruitfully applied to several neurophysiological signal classification problems. Considering the relevance of emotion in human cognition and behaviour, an important application of machine learning has been found in the field of emotion identification based on neurophysiological activity. Nonetheless, there is high variability in results in the literature depending on the neuronal activity measurement, the signal features and the classifier type. The present work aims to provide new methodological insight into machine learning applied to emotion identification based on electrophysiological brain activity. For this reason, we analysed previously recorded EEG activity measured while emotional stimuli, high and low arousal (auditory and visual) were provided to a group of healthy participants. Our target signal to classify was the pre-stimulus onset brain activity. Classification performance of three different classifiers (LDA, SVM and kNN) was compared using both spectral and temporal features. Furthermore, we also contrasted the performance of static and dynamic (time evolving) approaches. The best static feature-classifier combination was the SVM with spectral features (51.8%), followed by LDA with spectral features (51.4%) and kNN with temporal features (51%). The best dynamic feature‑classifier combination was the SVM with temporal features (63.8%), followed by kNN with temporal features (63.70%) and LDA with temporal features (63.68%). The results show a clear increase in classification accuracy with temporal dynamic features.

                Dudok et al. introduce a transgenic mouse line for selectively labeling hippocampal axo-axonic cells (AACs). AACs are activated by movements in awake, behaving mice and exert inhibitory postsynaptic effects on CA1 pyramidal cells. During a spatial navigation task, location-specific AAC silencing induces novel place fields in pyramidal cells.

                Hennig et al. consider learning in the brain through the lens of optimization, a powerful framework for training artificial networks. They identify three aspects of how neural population activity changes during learning that cannot be readily described as optimization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during economic choices under variable action costs</a></h4>

              
                The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACCd) in decision making has often been discussed but remains somewhat unclear. On the one hand, numerous studies implicated this area in decisions driven by effort or action cost. On the other hand, work on economic choices between goods (under fixed action costs) found that neurons in ACCd encoded only post-decision variables. To advance our understanding of the role played by this area in decision making, we trained monkeys to choose between different goods (juice types) offered in variable amounts and with different action costs. Importantly, the task design dissociated computation of the action cost from planning of any particular action. Neurons in ACCd encoded the chosen value and the binary choice outcome in several reference frames (chosen juice, chosen cost, chosen action). Thus, this area provided a rich representation of post-decision variables. In contrast to the OFC, neurons in ACCd did not represent pre-decision variables such as individual offer values in any reference frame. Hence, ongoing decisions are unlikely guided by ACCd. Conversely, neuronal activity in this area might inform subsequent actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simplifying the development of portable, scalable, and reproducible workflows</a></h4>

              
                Command-line software plays a critical role in biology research. However, processes for installing and executing software differ widely. The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a community standard that addresses this problem. Using CWL, tool developers can formally describe a tool’s inputs, outputs, and other execution details. CWL documents can include instructions for executing tools inside software containers. Accordingly, CWL tools are portable—they can be executed on diverse computers—including personal workstations, high-performance clusters, or the cloud. CWL also supports workflows, which describe dependencies among tools and using outputs from one tool as inputs to others. To date, CWL has been used primarily for batch processing of large datasets, especially in genomics. But it can also be used for analytical steps of a study. This article explains key concepts about CWL and software containers and provides examples for using CWL in biology research. CWL documents are text-based, so they can be created manually, without computer programming. However, ensuring that these documents conform to the CWL specification may prevent some users from adopting it. To address this gap, we created ToolJig, a Web application that enables researchers to create CWL documents interactively. ToolJig validates information provided by the user to ensure it is complete and valid. After creating a CWL tool or workflow, the user can create ‘input-object’ files, which store values for a particular invocation of a tool or workflow. In addition, ToolJig provides examples of how to execute the tool or workflow via a workflow engine. ToolJig and our examples are available at <a href="https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig">https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig</a>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of irreversible somatic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                A key innovation emerging in complex animals is irreversible somatic differentiation: daughters of a vegetative cell perform a vegetative function as well, thus, forming a somatic lineage that can no longer be directly involved in reproduction. Primitive species use a different strategy: vegetative and reproductive tasks are separated in time rather than in space. Starting from such a strategy, how is it possible to evolve life forms which use some of their cells exclusively for vegetative functions? Here, we develop an evolutionary model of development of a simple multicellular organism and find that three components are necessary for the evolution of irreversible somatic differentiation: (i) costly cell differentiation, (ii) vegetative cells that significantly improve the organism’s performance even if present in small numbers, and (iii) large enough organism size. Our findings demonstrate how an egalitarian development typical for loose cell colonies can evolve into germ-soma differentiation dominating metazoans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Control of Arabidopsis shoot stem cell homeostasis by two antagonistic CLE peptide signalling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell homeostasis in plant shoot meristems requires tight coordiantion between stem cell proliferation and cell differentiation. In Arabidopsis, stem cells express the secreted dodecapeptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3), which signals through the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-receptor kinase CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and related CLV1-family members to downregulate expression of the homeodomain transcription factor <i>WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>). WUS protein moves from cells below the stem cell domain to the meristem tip and promotes stem cell identity, together with <i>CLV3</i> expression, generating a negative feedback loop. How stem cell activity in the meristem centre is coordinated with organ initiation and cell differentiation at the periphery is unknown. We show here that the <i>CLE40</i> gene, encoding a secreted peptide closely related to CLV3, is expressed in the SAM in differentiating cells in a pattern complementary to that of <i>CLV3</i>. <i>CLE40</i> promotes <i>WUS</i> expression via BAM1, a CLV1-family receptor, and <i>CLE40</i> expression is in turn repressed in a <i>WUS</i>-dependent manner. Together, <i>CLE40-BAM1-WUS</i> establish a second negative feedback loop. We propose that stem cell homeostasis is achieved through two intertwined pathways that adjust WUS activity and incorporate information on the size of the stem cell domain, via <i>CLV3-CLV1</i>, and on cell differentiation via <i>CLE40-BAM1</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tbx5 drives aldh1a2 expression to regulate a RA-Hedgehog-Wnt gene regulatory network coordinating cardiopulmonary development</a></h4>

              
                The gene regulatory networks that coordinate the development of the cardiac and pulmonary systems are essential for terrestrial life but poorly understood. The T-box transcription factor Tbx5 is critical for both pulmonary specification and heart development, but how these activities are mechanistically integrated remains unclear. Here using <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse embryos, we establish molecular links between Tbx5 and retinoic acid (RA)-signaling in the mesoderm and between RA signaling and sonic hedgehog expression in the endoderm to unveil a conserved RA-Hedgehog-Wnt signaling cascade coordinating cardiopulmonary development. We demonstrate that Tbx5 directly maintains expression of <i>aldh1a2, </i>the RA-synthesizing enzyme, in the foregut lateral plate mesoderm via an evolutionarily conserved intronic enhancer. Tbx5 promotes posterior second heart field identity in a positive feedback loop with RA, antagonizing a Fgf8-Cyp regulatory module to restrict FGF activity to the anterior. We find that Tbx5/Aldh1a2-dependent RA signaling directly activates <i>shh</i> transcription in the adjacent foregut endoderm through a conserved MACS1 enhancer. Hedgehog signaling coordinates with Tbx5 in the mesoderm to activate expression of <i>wnt2/2b,</i> which induces pulmonary fate in the foregut endoderm. These results provide mechanistic insight into the interrelationship between heart and lung development informing cardiopulmonary evolution and birth defects.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A bacterial membrane sculpting protein with BAR domain-like activity</a></h4>

              
                Bin/Amphiphysin/RVS (BAR) domain proteins belong to a superfamily of coiled-coil proteins influencing membrane curvature in eukaryotes and are associated with vesicle biogenesis, vesicle-mediated protein trafficking, and intracellular signaling. Here we report a bacterial protein with BAR domain-like activity, BdpA, from <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> MR-1, known to produce redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer-scale outer membrane extensions (OMEs). BdpA is required for uniform size distribution of membrane vesicles and influences scaffolding of OMEs into a consistent diameter and curvature. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy reveals a strain lacking BdpA produces lobed, disordered OMEs rather than membrane tubules or narrow chains produced by the wild type strain. Overexpression of BdpA promotes OME formation during planktonic growth of <i>S. oneidensis</i> where they are not typically observed. Heterologous expression results in OME production in <i>Marinobacter atlanticus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Based on the ability of BdpA to alter membrane architecture <i>in vivo</i>, we propose that BdpA and its homologs comprise a newly identified class of bacterial BAR domain-like proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">White matter microstructural and morphometric alterations in autism: Implications for intellectual and verbal capabilities</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neuroimage literature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a moderate-to-high risk of bias, partially because those combined with intellectual impairment (II) and/or minimally verbal (MV) status are generally ignored. We aimed to provide more comprehensive insights into white matter alterations of ASD, inclusive of individuals with II (ASD-II-Only) or MV expression (ASD-MV). Methods: Sixty-five participants with ASD (ASD-Whole; 16.6{+/-}5.9 years; comprising 34 intellectually able youth, ASD-IA, and 31 intellectually impaired youth, ASD-II, including 24 ASD-II-Only plus 7 ASD-MV) and 38 demographic-matched typically developing controls (TDC; 17.3{+/-}5.6 years) were scanned in accelerated diffusion-weighted MRI. Fixel-based analysis was undertaken to investigate the categorical differences in fiber density (FD), fiber cross-section (FC), and a combined index (FDC), and brain-symptom/cognition associations. Results: ASD-Whole had reduced FD in the anterior and posterior corpus callosum and left cerebellum Crus I, and smaller FDC in right cerebellum Crus II, compared to TDC. ASD-II, relative to TDC, showed almost identical alterations to those from ASD-Whole vs. TDC. ASD-II-Only had greater FD/FDC in the isthmus-splenium of callosum than ASD-MV. Autistic severity negatively correlated with FC in right Crus I. Non-verbal full-scale IQ positively correlated with FC/FDC in cerebellum VI. FD/FDC of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a diagnosis-by-executive function interaction. Conclusions: ASD-associated white matter alterations appear driven by individuals combined with II and/or MV. Results suggest that changes in the corpus callosum and cerebellum are key for psychopathology and cognition associated with ASD. Our work highlights an essential to include understudied sub-populations on the spectrum in research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Benchmarking functional connectivity by the structure and geometry of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The brain's structural connectivity supports the propagation of electrical impulses, manifesting as patterns of co-activation, termed functional connectivity. Functional connectivity emerges from the underlying sparse structural connections, particularly through poly-synaptic communication. As a result, functional connections between brain regions without direct structural links are numerous, but their organization is not completely understood. Here we investigate the organization of functional connections without direct structural links. We develop a simple, data-driven method to benchmark functional connections with respect to their underlying structural and geometric embedding. We then use this method to re-weigh and re-express functional connectivity. We find evidence of unexpectedly strong functional connectivity within the canonical intrinsic networks of the brain. We also find unexpectedly strong functional connectivity at the apex of the unimodal-transmodal hierarchy. Our results suggest that both phenomena -- functional modules and functional hierarchies -- emerge from functional interactions that transcend the underlying structure and geometry. These findings also potentially explain recent reports that structural and functional connectivity gradually diverge in transmodal cortex. Collectively, we show how structural connectivity and geometry can be used as a natural frame of reference with which to study functional connectivity patterns in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representations of temporal community structure in hippocampus and precuneus predict inductive reasoning decisions</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the world is shaped by inferences about underlying structure. For example, at the gym, you might notice that the same people tend to arrive around the same time and infer that they are friends that work out together. Consistent with this idea, after participants are presented with a temporal sequence of objects that follows an underlying community structure, they are biased to infer that objects from the same community share the same properties. Here, we used fMRI to measure neural representations of objects after temporal community structure learning and examine how these representations support inference about object relationships. We found that community structure learning affected inferred object similarity: when asked to spatially group items based on their experience, participants tended to group together objects from the same community. Neural representations in perirhinal cortex predicted individual differences in object grouping, suggesting that high-level object representations are affected by temporal community learning. Furthermore, participants were biased to infer that objects from the same community would share the same properties. Using computational modeling of temporal learning and inference decisions, we found that inductive reasoning is influenced by both detailed knowledge of temporal statistics and abstract knowledge of the temporal communities. The fidelity of temporal community representations in hippocampus and precuneus predicted the degree to which temporal community membership biased reasoning decisions. Our results suggest that temporal knowledge is represented at multiple levels of abstraction, and that perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, and precuneus may support inference based on this knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus-striatum wiring diagram revealed by directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and the striatum represent two major systems in the brain for learning, memory and navigation. Although they were traditionally considered as two parallel systems responsible for distinct types of learning or navigation, increasing evidence indicates a close synergetic or competitive interaction between them. Both the hippocampus and the striatum consist of multiple anatomical and functional domains. Besides the limited direct projection from the hippocampus to the ventral striatum, most of the functional interaction between them may be mediated by polysynaptic projections. Polysynaptic connectivity has been difficult to examine due to a lack of methods to continuously track the pathways in a controlled manner. Here we developed a novel approach for directed stepwise polysynaptic tracing by reconstituting a replication-deficient retrograde transneuronal virus - pseudorabies virus lacking gene IE180 (PRV{Delta}IE. We minimized PRV neurotoxicity by temporally restricting viral replication; and enabled both anatomical tracing and functional analysis of the circuits. With these tools, we delineated a hippocampus striatum wiring diagram, which consists of pathways from specific functional domains in the hippocampus to corresponding domains in the striatum via distinct intermediate regions. This polysynaptic wring diagram provides a structural foundation for further elucidation of the interaction between the hippocampus and the stratum in multiple brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Time-based binding as a solution to and a limitation for flexible cognition</a></h4>

              
                Why can't we keep as many items as we want in working memory? It has long been debated whether this resource limitation is a bug (a downside of our fallible biological system) or instead a feature (an optimal response to a computational problem). We propose that the resource limitation is a consequence of a useful feature. Specifically, we propose that flexible cognition requires time-based binding, and time-based binding necessarily limits the number of (bound) memoranda that can be stored simultaneously. Time-based binding is most naturally instantiated via neural oscillations, for which there exists ample experimental evidence. We report simulations that illustrate this theory and that relate it to empirical data. We also compare the theory to several other (feature and bug) resource theories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic remodeling of ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum in axon terminals of motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                In neurons, endoplasmic reticulum forms a highly dynamic network that enters axons and presynaptic terminals and plays a central role in Ca2+ homeostasis and synapse maintenance. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in regulation of its dynamic remodeling as well as its function in axon development and presynaptic differentiation remain elusive. Here, we used high resolution microscopy and live cell imaging to investigate rapid movements of endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes in axons of cultured motoneurons after stimulation with Brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Our results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum extends into axonal growth cone filopodia where its integrity and dynamic remodeling are regulated mainly by actin and its motor protein myosin VI. Additionally, we found that in axonal growth cones, ribosomes assemble into 80S subunits within seconds and associate with ER in response to extracellular stimuli which describes a novel function of axonal ER in dynamic regulation of local translation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermanual transfer of visuomotor learning is facilitated by a cognitive strategy</a></h4>

              
                Humans continuously adapt their movement to a novel environment by recalibrating their sensorimotor system. Recent evidence, however, shows that explicit planning to compensate for external changes, i.e. a cognitive strategy, can also aid performance. If such a strategy is indeed planned in external space, it should improve performance in an effector independent manner. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether promoting a cognitive strategy during a visual-force adaptation task performed in one hand can facilitate learning for the opposite hand. Participants rapidly adjusted the height of visual bar on screen to a target level by isometrically exerting force on a handle using their right hand. Visuomotor gain increased during the task and participants learned the increased gain. Visual feedback was continuously provided for one group, while for another group only the endpoint of the force trajectory was presented. The latter has been reported to promote cognitive strategy use. We found that endpoint feedback produced stronger intermanual transfer of learning and slower response times than continuous feedback. In a separate experiment, we confirmed that the aftereffect is indeed reduced when only endpoint feedback is provided, a finding that has been consistently observed when cognitive strategies are used. The results suggest that intermanual transfer can be facilitated by a cognitive strategy. This indicates that the behavioral observation of intermanual transfer can be achieved either by forming an effector-independent motor representation, or by sharing an effector-independent cognitive strategy between the hands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics of illusory tactile pulling sensations</a></h4>

              
                The sensation of directional forces and their associated sensorimotor commands are inextricably intertwined, complicating the identification of brain circuits responsible for tactile pulling sensations. One hypothesis is that, like tactile frequency discrimination, pulling sensations are generated by early sensory-frontal activity. Alternatively, they may be generated later in the somatosensory association cortex. To dissociate these accounts and uncouple the pulling sensation from unrelated but correlated sensory and motor processing, we combined high-density EEG with an oddball paradigm and asymmetric vibration, which creates an illusory sensation of the hand being directionally pulled. Oddballs that created a pulling sensation in the opposite direction to common stimuli were compared to the same oddballs in the context of neutral common stimuli (symmetric vibration) and to neutral oddballs. Brain responses to having directional pulling expectations violated by directional stimuli were therefore isolated. Contrary to the sensory-frontal account, frontal N140 brain activity was actually larger for neutral than pulling oddballs. Instead, pulling sensations were associated with amplitude and latency modulations of midline P200 and P3b potentials, and specifically, to contralateral parietal lobe activity 280ms post-stimulus. The timing of this activity suggested pulling sensations involve spatial processing, such as tactile remapping between coordinate frames. Source localization showed this activity to be centered on the postcentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus, suggesting that pulling sensations arise via the processing of body position, tactile orientation and peripersonal space. Our results demonstrate how tactile illusions can uniquely disambiguate parietal contributions to somatosensation by removing unrelated sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predictive regulation of cardiovascular system on emergence of auditory-motor interaction in young infants</a></h4>

              
                Humans develop auditory-motor interaction to produce a variety of rhythmic sounds using body movements, which are often produced and amplified with tools, such as drumming. The extended production of sounds allows us to express a wide range of emotions, accompanied by physiological changes. According to previous studies, even young infants exhibit movements in response to auditory feedback. However, their exhibition of physiological adaptation on emergence of auditory-motor interaction is unclear. We investigated the heart rate change associated with auditory feedback to spontaneous limb movements in 3-month-old infants. The results showed that, in response to the auditory feedback, infants begin to increase heart rate more selectively immediately before the timing of the feedback. Furthermore, they gradually suppress the peak intensity of the heart rate increase through auditory-motor experience. These findings suggest that emergence of auditory-motor interaction in young infants involves predictive regulation to implicitly maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system. The predictive regulation, which is referred to as allostasis, may contribute to the prolonged sound production and provide a developmental basis for more sophisticated goal-directed behavior of producing rhythmic sounds.
