              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16865">An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.16865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07572">Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.07572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How neurons integrate the myriad synaptic inputs scattered across their dendrites is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. These non-linearities have motivated mathematical descriptions of single neuron as a two-layer computational units, which have been shown to increase substantially the computational abilities of neurons, compared to linear dendritic integration. However, current analytical studies are restricted to neurons with unconstrained synaptic weights and unplausible dendritic non-linearities. Here, we introduce a two-layer model with sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, and investigate its properties using both statistical physics methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dendritic non-linearity enhances both the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity. We characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We calculate analytically the distribution of synaptic weights in networks close to maximal capacity, and find that a large fraction of zero-weight ('silent' or 'potential') synapses naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses, as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. We test our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets and observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11164">The Influence of Initial Connectivity on Biologically Plausible Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain learns can be advanced by investigating biologically plausible learning rules -- those that obey known biological constraints, such as locality, to serve as valid brain learning models. Yet, many studies overlook the role of architecture and initial synaptic connectivity in such models. Building on insights from deep learning, where initialization profoundly affects learning dynamics, we ask a key but underexplored neuroscience question: how does initial synaptic connectivity shape learning in neural circuits? To investigate this, we train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are widely used for brain modeling, with biologically plausible learning rules. Our findings reveal that initial weight magnitude significantly influences the learning performance of such rules, mirroring effects previously observed in training with backpropagation through time (BPTT). By examining the maximum Lyapunov exponent before and after training, we uncovered the greater demands that certain initialization schemes place on training to achieve desired information propagation properties. Consequently, we extended the recently proposed gradient flossing method, which regularizes the Lyapunov exponents, to biologically plausible learning and observed an improvement in learning performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine the impact of initialization on biologically plausible learning rules for RNNs and to subsequently propose a biologically plausible remedy. Such an investigation can lead to neuroscientific predictions about the influence of initial connectivity on learning dynamics and performance, as well as guide neuromorphic design.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05378">A Portable Solution for Simultaneous Human Movement and Mobile EEG Acquisition: Readiness Potentials for Basketball Free-throw Shooting</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in wireless electroencephalography (EEG) technology promise to record brain-electrical activity in everyday situations. To better understand the relationship between brain activity and natural behavior, it is necessary to monitor human movement patterns. Here, we present a pocketable setup consisting of two smartphones to simultaneously capture human posture and EEG signals. We asked 26 basketball players to shoot 120 free throws each. First, we investigated whether our setup allows us to capture the readiness potential (RP) that precedes voluntary actions. Second, we investigated whether the RP differs between successful and unsuccessful free-throw attempts. The results confirmed the presence of the RP, but the amplitude of the RP was not related to shooting success. However, offline analysis of real-time human pose signals derived from a smartphone camera revealed pose differences between successful and unsuccessful shots for some individuals. We conclude that a highly portable, low-cost and lightweight acquisition setup, consisting of two smartphones and a head-mounted wireless EEG amplifier, is sufficient to monitor complex human movement patterns and associated brain dynamics outside the laboratory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05558">Quantum Simplicial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from graph-structured data but are limited to modeling pairwise interactions, insufficient for capturing higher-order relationships present in many real-world systems. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) has allowed for systematic modeling of hierarchical higher-order interactions by relying on combinatorial topological spaces such as simplicial complexes. In parallel, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have been introduced to leverage quantum mechanics for enhanced computational and learning power. In this work, we present the first Quantum Topological Deep Learning Model: Quantum Simplicial Networks (QSNs), being QNNs operating on simplicial complexes. QSNs are a stack of Quantum Simplicial Layers, which are inspired by the Ising model to encode higher-order structures into quantum states. Experiments on synthetic classification tasks show that QSNs can outperform classical simplicial TDL models in accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the potential of combining quantum computing with TDL for processing data on combinatorial topological spaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05735">ELENA: Epigenetic Learning through Evolved Neural Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of metaheuristic algorithms in solving complex network optimization problems, they often struggle with adaptation, especially in dynamic or high-dimensional search spaces. Traditional approaches can become stuck in local optima, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal solutions. Most of the widely accepted advanced algorithms do well either on highly complex or smaller search spaces due to the lack of adaptation. To address these limitations, we present ELENA (Epigenetic Learning through Evolved Neural Adaptation), a new evolutionary framework that incorporates epigenetic mechanisms to enhance the adaptability of the core evolutionary approach. ELENA leverages compressed representation of learning parameters improved dynamically through epigenetic tags that serve as adaptive memory. Three epigenetic tags (mutation resistance, crossover affinity, and stability score) assist with guiding solution space search, facilitating a more intelligent hypothesis landscape exploration. To assess the framework performance, we conduct experiments on three critical network optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). Experiments indicate that ELENA achieves competitive results, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods on network optimization tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05663">Learning to Measure Quantum Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has attracted growing attention, prompting extensive research into quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to solve diverse and complex problems. Designing high-performance QML models demands expert-level proficiency, which remains a significant obstacle to the broader adoption of QML. A few major hurdles include crafting effective data encoding techniques and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are crucial to the performance of QML models. Additionally, the measurement phase is frequently overlooked-most current QML models rely on pre-defined measurement protocols that often fail to account for the specific problem being addressed. We introduce a novel approach that makes the observable of the quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-learnable. Our method features an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, where the parameterized observable is trained alongside the ordinary quantum circuit parameters simultaneously. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method can identify observables for variational quantum circuits that lead to improved outcomes, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby boosting the overall performance of QML models.

                arXiv:2501.05684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility is a fundamental aspect of social behavior, with broad applications in transportation, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. However, for decades new mathematical formulas to model mobility phenomena have been scarce and usually discovered by analogy to physical processes, such as the gravity model and the radiation model. These sporadic discoveries are often thought to rely on intuition and luck in fitting empirical data. Here, we propose a systematic approach that leverages symbolic regression to automatically discover interpretable models from human mobility data. Our approach finds several well-known formulas, such as the distance decay effect and classical gravity models, as well as previously unknown ones, such as an exponential-power-law decay that can be explained by the maximum entropy principle. By relaxing the constraints on the complexity of model expressions, we further show how key variables of human mobility are progressively incorporated into the model, making this framework a powerful tool for revealing the underlying mathematical structures of complex social phenomena directly from observational data.

                arXiv:2501.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to the numbers that are located in its headers. In this study, we analyze different techniques to solve this type of logical problem using an Heuristic Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Heuristic Algorithm with Neural Network. Furthermore, we generate a public dataset to train the neural networks. We published this dataset and the code of the algorithms. Combination of the heuristic algorithm with a neural network obtained the best results. From state of the art review, no previous works used neural network to solve nonograms, nor combined a network with other algorithms to accelerate the resolution process.

	<p>Background: This study examined the prevalence of mental health issues among Paraguayan researchers and their relationships with emotional regulation and psychosocial factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 235 researchers was conducted using validated instruments: the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ); and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Sociodemographic, academic, and behavioral variables were also analyzed. Results: Findings revealed significant rates of depression (26.4%), anxiety (30.6%), and stress (32.3%), with female researchers reporting nearly twice the rates of anxiety and stress compared to males. Researchers with doctoral degrees exhibited lower anxiety levels, emphasizing the protective role of advanced academic qualifications. Conversely, younger and early-career researchers were more vulnerable to psychological distress. High job demands and emotional dysregulation were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes, while hazardous alcohol consumption and low physical activity further exacerbated risks. Conclusions: These findings highlight the urgent need for institutional reforms to prioritize mental health and well-being in academic environments. By advancing the understanding of occupational health in resource-limited settings, this study provides actionable recommendations to improve the working conditions and mental health of researchers in Paraguay and beyond.</p>

">Vascular contribution to cognitive impairment in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: TRPV4 and KLF2 as key mediators of neurovascular dysfunction in the ZSF1 model</a></h4>

              
                Background The development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are strongly associated with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and aging. Microvascular dysfunction may be key a pathological step in the development of cognitive dysfunction during HFpEF. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the cerebrovascular and cognitive phenotype in ZSF1 rats and identify molecular processes central to the development of VCI during HFpEF. Methods Male Lean and Obese rats underwent blood pressure and glucose measurements, echocardiography and a series of behavioural tasks at three different time points. Cerebral blood flow was measured over the barrel cortex using laser speckle contrast imaging and neurovascular coupling was assessed upon whisker stimulation. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and vascular density. Lastly, isolated cortical microvessels were used for transcriptomic analysis, and selected targets were validated in brain sections via fluorescent multiplex in-situ hybridization. Results Obese ZSF1 rats exhibited neurovascular uncoupling, along with an impaired short- and long-term memory, as well as spatial learning. In addition, BBB permeability and cerebral vascular density were elevated in Obese vs Lean at 22-23 and 34-35 weeks of age, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of brain microvessels revealed the regulation of processes related to angiogenesis, vasoreactivity, immune mechanisms and vascular remodelling. Among the top regulated biological processes, Trpv4 and Klf2 were found to be consistently downregulated in Obese vs Lean rats and involved in many of the top regulated biological processes. This was further verified in brain sections at 22-23 weeks of age. Conclusion Obese ZSF1 rats develop cognitive impairment, which is related to dysfunction of the neurovascular unit. This cerebrovascular phenotype progresses along with the onset of HFpEF and is associated with downregulation of Trpv4 and Klf2 in cerebral microvessels, two key genes known for their vasoprotective actions.

">Regenerative failure of sympathetic axons contributes to deficits in functional recovery after nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                Renewed scientific interest in sympathetic modulation of muscle and neuromuscular junctions has spurred a flurry of new discoveries with major implications for motor diseases. However, the role sympathetic axons play in the persistent dysfunction that occurs after nerve injuries remains to be explored. Peripheral nerve injuries are common and lead to motor, sensory, and autonomic deficits that result in lifelong disabilities. Given the importance of sympathetic signaling in muscle metabolic health and maintaining bodily homeostasis, it is imperative to understand the regenerative capacity of sympathetic axons after injury. Therefore, we tested sympathetic axon regeneration and functional reinnervation of skin and muscle, both acute and long-term, using a battery of anatomical, pharmacological, chemogenetic, cell culture, analytical chemistry, and electrophysiological techniques. We employed several established growth-enhancing interventions, including electrical stimulation and conditioning lesion, as well as an innovative tool called bioluminescent optogenetics. Our results indicate that sympathetic regeneration is not enhanced by any of these treatments and may even be detrimental to sympathetic regeneration. Despite the complete return of motor reinnervation after sciatic nerve injury, gastrocnemius muscle atrophy and deficits in muscle cellular energy charge, as measured by relative ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations, persisted long after injury, even with electrical stimulation. We suggest that these long-term deficits in muscle energy charge and atrophy are related to the deficiency in sympathetic axon regeneration. New studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying sympathetic regeneration to develop therapeutics that can enhance the regeneration of all axon types.

">A Mean Field Theory for Pulse-Coupled Oscillators based on the Spike Time Response Curve</a></h4>

              
                A mean field method for pulse-coupled oscillators with delays used a self-connected oscillator to represent a synchronous cluster of N-1 oscillators and a single oscillator assumed to be perturbed from the cluster. A periodic train of biexponential conductance input was divided into a tonic and a phasic component representing the mean field input. A single cycle of the phasic conductance from the cluster was applied to the single oscillator embedded in the tonic component at different phases to measure the change in the cycle length which the perturbation was initiated, that is, the first order phase response curve (PRC), and the second order PRC in the following cycle. A homogeneous network of 100 biophysically calibrated inhibitory interneurons with either shunting or hyperpolarizing inhibition tested the predictive power of the method. A self-consistency criterion predicted the oscillation frequency of the network from the PRCs as a function of the synaptic delay. The major determinant of the stability of synchrony was the sign of the slope of the first order PRC of the single oscillator in response to an input from the self-connected cluster at a phase corresponding to the delay value. For most short delays, first order PRCs correctly predicted the frequency and stability of simulated network activity. However, considering the second order PRC improved the frequency prediction and resolved an incorrect prediction of stability of global synchrony at delays close to the free running period of single neurons in which a discontinuity in the PRC precluded existence of 1:1 self-locking.

">ACTIVITY IN HUMAN DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS SIGNALS CHANGES IN BEHAVIOURAL POLICY</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is an important source of serotonin to the human forebrain, however there is little consensus about its behavioural function. We build on recent results from animal models to demonstrate that activity in human DRN represents changes between general behavioural policies. We use a novel behavioural task to show that human participants change their policy to pursue or reject reward opportunities as a function of the average value of opportunities in the environment. Activity in DRN - but no other neuromodulatory nucleus - signalled such policy changes. Patterns of multivariate activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insular cortex (AI), meanwhile, tracked the relative value of reward opportunities given the average value of the environment. We therefore suggest that DRN, dACC and AI form a circuit in which dACC/AI compute the relative value of reward opportunities given the current context, and DRN implements changes in behavioural policy based on context-specific values.

">PHYSICAL EXERCISE RESTORES NEUROCOGNITIVE HOMEOSTASIS DISRUPTED BY NON-SEVERE MURINE MALARIA</a></h4>

              
                Malaria disrupts neurocognitive homeostasis in humans, including in the non-severe manifestation of the disease - which is the most prevalent form of malaria in the world. This disruption is classically observed in human and experimental models of cerebral malaria. More recently, we demonstrated that this can also be observed in an experimental model of non-severe malaria and that Th2-immune response improves cognition and attenuates anxiety-like behavior associated to malaria. Complementarily, we have been studying the effect of physical exercise in restoring the neurocognitive homeostasis lost after non-severe murine malaria.

">Alprazolam induces anterograde amnesia for contextual fear memory and alters dorsoventral hippocampal neuronal ensembles in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed anxiolytic drugs that act on GABAa receptors, and can result in anterograde amnesia, or the inability to form new memories. While BZDs have been used for decades, the brain regions and neuronal mechanisms responsible for this detrimental side effect are largely unknown at the systems neuroscience level. To analyze the effects of BZDs on long-term memory, activity-dependent ArcCreERT2 x eYFP mice were injected with Alprazolam 30 minutes prior to a 3-shock contextual fear conditioning (CFC) procedure and encoding ensembles were tagged with eYFP. Mice were re-exposed to the same context 5 days later, and retrieval cell activation was analyzed using the immediate early gene (IEG), c-Fos, allowing us to determine which brain regions undergo changes after alprazolam injection. Additionally, we address the question of whether alprazolam induces state-dependent memory by altering the timelines of injection. We found that 1) alprazolam treated male and female mice exhibit a decrease in memory retention and, 2) alprazolam treated female and male mice show a decrease in memory retention with saline injection prior to re-exposure, 3) alprazolam treated female mice exhibit increased EYFP+ (encoding) activation in the dCA1 and enhanced engram activation in the dCA3, and 4) alprazolam treated females showed less c-Fos+ activation in the vCA1. These results suggest that alprazolam induces sex-specific ensemble activation throughout the hippocampus and will help us understand the long-term memory deficits associated with BZD use.

">Autosuggestion and Mental Imagery Bias the Perception of Social Emotions</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive processes that modulate social emotion perception are of pivotal interest for psychological and clinical research. Autosuggestion and mental imagery are two candidate processes for such a modulation, however, their precise effect on social emotion perception has not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated if autosuggestion and mental imagery during an adaptation period influence the perception of subsequent facial emotions, and if so, to which extent. Separate cohorts of participants took part in five experiments, where they either mentally affirmed (autosuggested, Experiments 1a and 1b) or imagined (Experiment 2) that a neutral face would be expressing a specific emotion (happy or sad). Subsequent facial emotion perception was then assessed by calculating points of subjective equality (PSEs) along a happiness-sadness continuum. Our results show that both autosuggestion and mental imagery induce a bias toward perceiving facial emotions in the direction of the desired emotion, with larger Bayes factors supporting autosuggestion. Experiment 3 confirmed no effects when emotional words were presented instead, suggesting a reduced role of response bias to drive this effect. Finally, experiment 4 validated the experimental setup by demonstrating standard contrastive aftereffects when participants are adapted to actual, physical emotional faces. Together, our findings provide an initial step toward understanding the potential of intentional cognitive processes to modulate social emotions, specifically by biasing emotional face perception. With comparable effect sizes observed for both autosuggestion and mental imagery, these strategies appear promising as tools for self-directed interventions.

">Overcoming pride via the dorsal ACC underlies acceptance of unfair offers</a></h4>

              
                Bargaining is a fundamental social behavior in which individuals often accept unfair offers. Traditional behavioral models, based solely on choice data, typically interpret this acceptance as simple reward-maximization. However, the suppression of emotions such as inequity aversion or pride may also play a critical role in this decision. Incorporating response time alongside choice data provides a means to quantify participants' internal conflict in suppressing these emotions and deciding to accept unfair offers. In this study, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the ultimatum game, where participants decided within 10 seconds whether to accept or reject monetary distribution offers from a proposer. Using the drift diffusion model (DDM), we quantified decision-making dynamics based on both choice and response time. Participants who suppressed disadvantageous inequity (DI)-driven rejection (reflected by a lower DDM weight for DI) exhibited heightened dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity in response to DI. Functional connectivity analysis revealed a negative correlation between the dACC and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) when DI was large, which encoded both the rejection rates, and the response times associated with accepting DI offers. Furthermore, vlPFC activity was significantly correlated with amygdala activity during high DI conditions, specifically encoding response time for accepting DI offers but not rejection rates. Importantly, these findings could not be captured using standard value-based models that rely solely on choice data. Our results underscore the dACC's critical role in mediating the suppression of emotional responses to DI, enabling the acceptance of unfair offers in a dynamic bargaining process.

">Constructing structural and functional brain networks from regional brain profiles</a></h4>

              
                Brain network analysis has become an important approach to understanding brain function. Given the human brain's complexity and dynamic nature, traditional brain networks based on temporal synchronization may not capture all the nuances of brain activity. The emerging trend is to construct brain networks from regional information, creating pathways that connect regional profiles to network-level insights to better understand brain function. In this study, we constructed structural networks based on regional brain structural information, specifically gray matter volume (GMV), and functional networks based on regional brain activity, measured by brain entropy (BEN). We compared these newly constructed networks with traditional networks: functional connectivity networks (FCN) based on temporal synchronization, structural connectivity networks (SCN) derived from fiber tracking, and MEG-derived functional networks. Our results reveal that GMV network (GMVN) and BEN network (BENN) show correlations with these networks but also exhibit distinct differences. Furthermore, we conducted connectome gradient analyses, uncovering meaningful brain function distribution patterns in both GMVN and BENN. Finally, we used GMVN, BENN, and traditional FCN to predict cognitive and emotional scores. The results showed that BENN, in the resting state, provided the best prediction of both cognitive and emotional scores. This study systematically evaluates the relationship between brain networks constructed from regional brain information and existing networks, as well as their ability to predict behavioral phenotypes. It demonstrates that networks built from regional information capture aspects of brain activity that traditional networks cannot represent and may even provide superior predictive power for behavioral phenotypes. This opens a new path for understanding brain function from regional to network-level information and lays the foundation for future applications in brain development, individual differences, and clinical research.

">Sleep increases propagation speed of physiological brain pulsations</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, there is an increase in the brain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) solute convection driven by physiological pulsations. Although the main drivers of CSF flow, namely cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotor pulsations, become more powerful during sleep, there is relatively little information regarding their effects on CSF flow velocity across human brain during sleep. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG) to measure non-invasively changes in brain water flow during to sleep by tracking the propagating ultrafast signal changes induced by physiological brain pulsations. We first undertook a phantom study confirming that dense optical flow analysis of MREG data accurately detects water flow velocity, and reflects the power of the physiological pulsations. We then applied the method to quantify CSF water flow velocity in brain of healthy volunteers during EEG-verified awake and sleep recordings of ultrafast MREG data. Sleep induced an increase in CSF flow speed, as demonstrated by elevated vasomotor and respiratory pulsation speeds, while the speed of cardiovascular impulse propagation remained unchanged. The speed increases match previous findings of respective pulsation power changes, and correlated with slow delta EEG power. The sleep-induced CSF flow speed increases occurred dynamically over both pulsation cycles, without the large effects on flow directions reported previously in several neurological conditions. In conclusion, sleep increases 3D water flow speed dynamically in human brain regions showing concomitant pulse power increases, supporting a porous media model of hydrodynamics in brain cortex.

">Memory engram synapse 3D molecular architecture visualized by cryoCLEM-guided cryoET</a></h4>

              
                Memory is incorporated into the brain as physicochemical changes to engram cells. These are neuronal populations that form complex neuroanatomical circuits, are modified by experiences to store information, and allow for memory recall. At the molecular level, learning modifies synaptic communication to rewire engram circuits, a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity. However, despite its functional role on memory formation, the 3D molecular architecture of synapses within engram circuits is unknown. Here, we demonstrate the use of engram labelling technology and cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy (cryoCLEM)-guided cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) to visualize the in-tissue 3D molecular architecture of engram synapses of a contextual fear memory within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. Engram cells exhibited structural diversity of macromolecular constituents and organelles in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments and within the synaptic cleft, including in clusters of membrane proteins, synaptic vesicle occupancy, and F-actin copy number. This "engram to tomogram" approach, harnessing in vivo functional neuroscience and structural biology, provides a methodological framework for testing fundamental molecular plasticity mechanisms within engram circuits during memory encoding, storage and recall.

">Absolute measurement of fast and slow neuronal signals with fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution</a></h4>

              
                The concentrations of extracellular and intracellular signaling molecules, such as dopamine and cAMP, change over both fast and slow timescales and impact downstream pathways in a cell-type specific manner. Fluorescence sensors currently used to monitor such signals in vivo are typically optimized to detect fast, relative changes in concentration of the target molecule. They are less well suited to detect slowly-changing signals and rarely provide absolute measurements of either fast and slow signaling components. Here, we developed a system for fluorescence lifetime photometry at high temporal resolution (FLIPR) that utilizes frequency-domain analog processing to measure the absolute fluorescence lifetime of genetically-encoded sensors at high speed but with long-term stability and picosecond precision in freely moving mice. We applied FLIPR to investigate dopamine signaling in two functionally distinct regions in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and the tail of striatum (TOS). We observed higher tonic dopamine levels at baseline in the TOS compared to the NAC and detected differential and dynamic responses in phasic and tonic dopamine to appetitive and aversive stimuli. Thus, FLIPR enables simple monitoring of fast and slow time-scale neuronal signaling in absolute units, revealing previously unappreciated spatial and temporal variation even in well-studied signaling systems.

">Enhanced Neural Speech Tracking in Aging and Hearing Loss: The Role of Stochastic Resonance</a></h4>

              
                Tracking the envelope of speech in the brain is important for speech comprehension. Recent research suggests that acoustic background noise can enhance neural speech tracking, enabling the auditory system to robustly encode speech even under unfavorable conditions. Aging and hearing loss are associated with internal, neural noise in the auditory system, which raises the question whether additional acoustic background noise can enhance neural speech tracking in older adults. In the current electroencephalography study, younger (~25.5 years) and older adults (~68.5 years) listened to spoken stories either in quiet (clear) or in the presence of background noise at a wide range of different signal-to-noise ratios. In younger adults, neural speech tracking was enhanced by minimal background noise, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, that is, the response facilitation through noise. In contrast, older adults, compared to younger adults, showed enhanced neural speech tracking for clear speech and speech masked by minimal background noise, but the acoustic noise led to little enhancement in neural tracking in older people. The data demonstrate different sensitivity of the auditory cortex to speech masked by noise between younger and older adults. The results are consistent with the idea that the auditory cortex of older people exhibits more internal, neural noise that enhances neural speech tracking - through stochastic resonance - but that additional acoustic noise does not further support speech encoding. The work points to a highly non-linear auditory system that differs between younger and older adults.

">Long-term multichannel recordings in Drosophila flies reveal distinct responses to deviant visual stimuli during sleep compared to wake</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, behavioral responsiveness to external stimuli is decreased. This classical definition of sleep has been applied effectively across the animal kingdom to identify this common behavioral state in a growing list of creatures, from mammals to invertebrates. Yet it remains unclear whether decreased behavioral responsiveness during sleep is necessarily associated with decreased responsiveness in brain activity, especially in relative latecomers to the sleep field, such as insects. Here, we perform long-term multichannel electrophysiology in tethered Drosophila melanogaster flies exposed continuously to flashing visual stimuli. Flies were still able to sleep under these visual stimulation conditions, as determined by traditional immobility duration criteria for the field. Interestingly, local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in a transect through the fly brain failed to show any difference in amplitude during sleep compared to wake when the visual stimuli were invariant. In contrast, LFP responses were lower when visual stimuli were variable and of lower probability, especially in the central brain. Central brain responses to deviant stimuli were lowest during the deepest stage of sleep, characterized by more regular proboscis extensions. This shows that the sleeping fly brain processes low-probability visual stimuli in a different way than more repeated stimuli and presents Drosophila as a model system for studying the potential role of sleep in regulating predictive processing.

">Understanding the high-order network plasticity mechanisms of ultrasound neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation technique, offering a potential alternative to pharmacological treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders. While functional analysis has been instrumental in characterizing TUS effects, understanding the underlying mechanisms remains a challenge. Here, we developed a whole-brain model to represent functional changes as measured by fMRI, enabling us to investigate how TUS-induced effects propagate throughout the brain with increasing stimulus intensity. We implemented two mechanisms: one based on anatomical distance and another on broadcasting dynamics, to explore plasticity-driven changes in specific brain regions. Finally, we highlighted the role of higher-order functional interactions in localizing spatial effects of off-line TUS at two target areas-the right thalamus and inferior frontal cortex-revealing distinct patterns of functional reorganization. This work lays the foundation for mechanistic insights and predictive models of TUS, advancing its potential clinical applications.

">Transgenic A53T mice have astrocytic α-synuclein aggregates in dopamine and striatal regions</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease is considered biologically a neuronal alpha synuclein disease, largely ignoring the more widespread alpha synuclein deposition that occurs in astrocytes. Recent single cell transcriptomics have identified early astrocytic differences in both Parkinsons disease and mouse models with an increase in reactive astrocytes associated with proteostasis. To identify whether astrocytes accumulate alpha synuclein before or after neurons, the present study histologically assessed astrocytes and alpha synuclein accumulation in the M83 A53T transgenic mouse model of Parkinsons disease prior to significant neuronal alpha synuclein accumulation. The brains of M83 A53T transgenic and wild-type mice were perfusion fixed and serial sections of the midbrain and striatum processed for multiplex labelling. Digital images were captured from standardised sampling regions and astrocyte quantitation performed using QuPath software. Multivariate linear region models with Turkey posthoc tests were used to evaluate the effects of genotype on regional astrocyte morphology and numbers. The density of astrocytes within the substantia nigra pars compacta was approximately thirty percent greater compared with other sampled regions. Small aggregates of alpha synuclein were observed in astrocytic processes, including in wild-type mice where a quarter of all astrocytes had an obvious alpha synuclein aggregate. Compared to wild-type, A53T transgenic astrocytes had significantly enlarged somas with more processes consistent with a reactive phenotype. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A was present in analysed astrocytes, but not the synthesising enzyme for vitamin D CYP27B1. The A53T transgenic mice had more than double the numbers of astrocytes and 2.5 times more astrocytes with alpha synuclein aggregates compared to wild-type mice. These data suggest that alpha synuclein is normally cleared by astrocytes and that the substantia nigra pars compacta requires more astrocytic support than other midbrain dopaminergic regions or the striatum. This adds another vulnerability factor to those already known for the substantia nigra. In the A53T transgenic mouse model, astrocytes have an early upregulation of their clearance of alpha synuclein aggregates. While speculative, a loss of this ability to take up alpha synuclein in these regions may precipitate the selective neuronal degeneration and pathologies observed in Parkinsons disease. As we move to a biological definition for this disease, understanding this early role astrocytes needs to be considered further.

">Neural decoding of competitive decision-making in Rock-Paper-Scissors using EEG hyperscanning</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are fundamental to daily life, yet social neuroscience research has often studied individuals' brains in isolation. Hyperscanning, the simultaneous recording of neural data from multiple participants, enables real-time investigation of social processes by examining multiple brains while they interact. Previous hyperscanning research has mostly focused on cooperative tasks and remains limited in competitive contexts. Here, we obtained electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning data for 62 participants (31 pairs) who played a computerised version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, a classic paradigm for studying competitive decision-making. Although the optimal strategy is to be unpredictable and thus act randomly, participants exhibited behavioural biases, deviating from this ideal. Using multivariate decoding methods, we found that neural signals contained information about decisions made by participants during gameplay, revealing certain strategies. Notably, losers showed unique reliance on prior trials, suggesting memory-based strategies that may impair optimal performance. These results reveal how competitive decision-making is shaped by cognitive biases and memory of previous outcomes, highlighting the difficulty of achieving randomness in strategic contexts. This work advances our understanding of decision-making and cognitive dynamics in competitive interactions.

">The dependency of TMS-evoked potentials on electric-field orientation in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimulates the brain by electromagnetic induction. The outcome depends on multiple stimulation parameters such as the induced electric-field pattern (in particular, the location of the peak field and its orientation), intensity and timing. However, it is not clear how the TMS-evoked responses are affected by all the stimulation parameters. This study elucidates the dependency of the TMS-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) responses on the orientation of the stimulating electric field. To achieve this, we analysed a dataset from six subjects who were given pulses with 36 stimulus orientations to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and induced oscillations were analysed with cluster-based statistics. Source estimation was performed to assess the effects of stimulus orientation on the TMS-evoked signal propagation. The amplitudes of the early peaks (20 and 40 ms after the TMS pulse) strongly depended on the electric field orientation. Our analysis suggested orientation dependency up to 100 ms post-stimulus in most subjects, indicating changes in stimulation efficacy and potential changes in signal propagation from the stimulated site. These results suggest that different orientations may perturb different networks. Thus, the orientation is a crucial parameter for the stimulation outcome and should be adjusted according to the cortical network under investigation.

">OPTN protects retinal ganglion cells and ameliorates neuroinflammation in optic neuropathies</a></h4>

              
                Optineurin (OPTN) is a crucial component of the homeostatic pathway, playing a pivotal role in regulating a number of essential signaling pathways including NF-kB, interferon, autophagy, and vesicular trafficking. The dysfunction of OPTN has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal lobar dementia. Interestingly, mutations in OPTN are implicated as gain-of-function in glaucoma pathology and loss-of-function in ALS. However, the role of loss-of-function OPTN in glaucoma pathology remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that OPTN dysfunction contributes to chronic neuroinflammation, leading to sustained RGC death, which may represent a shared pathological mechanism in both normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and high-tension glaucoma (HTG). Retinal conditioned OPTN knockout contributes to short-term astrogliosis and long-term microglia activation, with the propagation of microglia activation spreading to the optic nerve. Moreover, OPTN loss-of-function and ocular hypertension affect the overlapped group of vulnerable RGCs, combined with the downregulation of OPTN in glaucoma patients, indicating an IOP-independent mechanism of glaucoma pathogenesis. Furthermore, we found that OPTN-driven NPY upregulation may suppress the CHOP-associated neurodegeneration. Our findings reveal a neuroprotective role for the OPTN-NPY signaling pathway, and its dysfunction promotes RGC loss in glaucoma pathology. The OPTN-NPY-mediated neuroinflammatory pathway provides a potential therapy for IOP-resistant glaucoma and highlights a druggable target for CHOP-associated neurodegeneration.

">Monoamine-induced diacylglycerol signaling rapidly accumulates Unc13 in nanoclusters for fast presynaptic potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators control mood, arousal, and behavior by inducing synaptic plasticity via G-protein coupled receptors. Long-term potentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release requires structural changes, but how fast potentiation is achieved within minutes remains enigmatic. Using the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction, we show that on the timescale of one minute, octopamine, the invertebrate analog of nor-epinephrine, rapidly potentiates evoked neurotransmitter release by a G protein coupled pathway involving presynaptic OAMB receptors and phospholipase C. No changes of presynaptic calcium influx were seen, but confocal signals of the release factor Unc13A and the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot increased within one minute of octopamine treatment. On the same timescale, live, single-molecule imaging of endogenously tagged Unc13 revealed its instantly reduced motility and its increased concentration in synaptic nanoclusters with potentiation. Presynaptic knockdown of Unc13A fully blocked fast potentiation and removal of its N-terminal localization sequence delocalized the protein fragment to the cytosol, but it was rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane by DAG analog phorbol esters and octopamine, pointing to a role in C-terminal domains. Point mutation of endogenous Unc13 disrupting diacylglycerol-binding to its C1 domain blocked plasticity-induced nanoscopic enrichment and synaptic potentiation. The mutation increased basal neurotransmission but reduced Unc13 levels, revealing a gain of function and potential homeostatic compensation. The mutation also blocked phorbol ester-induced potentiation, decreased the calcium-sensitivity of neurotransmission and caused short-term synaptic depression. At the organismal level, the mutation reduced locomotion and survival while enhancing reproduction. Thus, the Unc13 C1 domain mediates acute subsynaptic compaction of Unc13 under monoamine-induced potentiation and influences short-term plasticity, locomotion, reproduction, and survival.

">Neural correlates of approach and avoidance tendencies toward physical activity and sedentary stimuli: An fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Automatic tendencies toward physical activity and sedentary stimuli are involved in the regulation of physical activity behavior. However, the brain regions underlying these automatic tendencies remain largely unknown. Here, we used an approach-avoidance task and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 42 healthy young adults to investigate whether cortical and subcortical brain regions underpinning reward processing and executive function are associated with these tendencies. At the behavioral level, results showed more errors in avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli than physical activity stimuli. At the brain level, avoidance behavior following sedentary stimuli was associated with more activation of the motor control network (dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex, primary and secondary motor cortices, somatosensory cortex). In addition, increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, and structural deformation of the right hippocampus, were associated with a tendency toward approaching sedentary stimuli. Together, these results suggest that avoiding sedentary stimuli requires higher levels of behavioral control than avoiding physical activity stimuli.

">Neural signatures of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning across prefrontal cortex and striatum</a></h4>

              
                Animals integrate knowledge about how the state of the environment evolves to choose actions that maximise reward. Such goal-directed behaviour - or model-based (MB) reinforcement learning (RL) - can flexibly adapt choice to changes, being thus distinct from simpler habitual - or model-free (MF) RL - strategies. Previous inactivation and neuroimaging work implicates prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the caudate striatal region in MB-RL; however, details are scarce about its implementation at the single-neuron level. Here, we recorded from two PFC regions - the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and two striatal regions, caudate and putamen - while two rhesus macaques performed a sequential decision-making (two-step) task in which MB-RL involves knowledge about the statistics of reward and state transitions. All four regions, but particularly the ACC, encoded the rewards received and tracked the probabilistic state transitions that occurred. However, ACC (and to a lesser extent caudate) encoded the key variables of the task - namely the interaction between reward, transition and choice - which underlies MB decision-making. ACC and caudate neurons also encoded MB-derived estimates of choice values. Moreover, caudate value estimates of the choice options flipped when a rare transition occurred, demonstrating value update based on structural knowledge of the task. The striatal regions were unique (relative to PFC) in encoding the current and previous rewards with opposing polarities, reminiscent of dopaminergic neurons, and indicative of a MF prediction error. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of selective and temporally dissociable neural mechanisms underlying goal-directed behaviour.

">How Intrinsic Neural Timescales Relate To Event-Related Activity - Key Role For Intracolumnar Connections</a></h4>

              
                The relationship of the brain's intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) during the resting state with event-related activity in response to external stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we bridge this gap by combining computational modeling with magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to investigate the relation of intrinsic neuronal timescales (INT) with task-related activity, e.g., event-related fields (ERFs). Using the Jansen-Rit model, we first show that intracolumnar (and thus intra-regional) excitatory and inhibitory connections (rather than inter-regional feedback, feedforward and lateral connections between the columns of different regions) strongly influence both resting state INTs and task-related ERFs. Secondly, our results demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of event-related fields (mERFs) and INTs, observed in both model simulations and empirical MEG data collected during an emotional face recognition task. Thirdly, modeling shows that the positive relationship of mERF and INT depends on intracolumnar connections through observing that the correlation between them disappears for fixed values of intracolumnar connections. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intracolumnar connections as a shared biological mechanism underlying both the resting-state's INTs and the task-state's event-related activity including their interplay.

">Correlation between circadian and photoperiodic latitudinal clines in Drosophila littoralis</a></h4>

              
                Insects can survive harsh conditions, including Arctic winters, by entering a hormonally induced state of dormancy, known as diapause. Diapause is triggered by environmental cues such as shortening of the photoperiod (lengthening of the night). The time of entry into diapause depends on the latitude of the insects' habitat, and this applies even within a species: populations living at higher latitudes enter diapause earlier in the year than populations living at lower latitudes. A long-standing question in biology is whether the internal circadian clock, which governs daily behaviour and serves as a reference clock to measure night length, shows similar latitudinal adaptations. To address this question, we examined the onset of diapause and various behavioural and molecular parameters of the circadian clock in the cosmopolitan fly, Drosophila littoralis, a species distributed throughout Europe from the Black Sea (41 degrees N) to arctic regions (69 degrees N). We found that all clock parameters examined showed the same correlation with latitude as the critical night length for diapause induction. We conclude that the circadian clock has adapted to the latitude and that this may result in the observed latitudinal differences in the onset of diapause.

">Dynamic Norm-Based Coding of Vocal Identity in the Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Voice identity recognition is vital for social communication, yet its neural encoding mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated whether neurons in the anterior temporal voice area (aTVA) of macaques use norm-based coding (NBC), similar to face encoding in vision. Using synthetic vocalizations morphed along identity trajectories, we found that early neuronal responses (100 to 150 ms) exhibited V-shaped tuning, with minimal activity for the average voice and increased responses for extreme identities. Later (200 ms), a distinct rebound in activity for the average voice emerged, driven by a unique subpopulation. These results highlight a dynamic, multi-stage encoding strategy, extending NBC principles to auditory processing.

     alt="Neurological and Cognitive Effects of Hypothyroidism in Patients With Epilepsy: A Study on Anti-Seizure Medicines Therapy"/>
<p>The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of neurological disorders and cognitive pathologies in hypothyroidism and epilepsy patients undergoing anti-seizure medicines therapy. The study findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in managing cognitive and neurological impairments in patients with hypothyroidism and epilepsy. To enhance clinical practice, specific measures that could be implemented include integrating routine cognitive assessments into the standard care of patients with thyroid dysfunction and personalizing treatment protocols based on individual risk factors such as hormone levels, family history, and stress indicators.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine neurological disorders and cognitive impairments in patients with secondary hypothyroidism and epilepsy undergoing treatment with antiepileptic medications. The study included 184 patients divided into three groups: Group 1 (subclinical hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 60), Group 2 (manifest hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 64), and Group 3 (control, <i>n</i> = 60). Patients in Group 2 received levothyroxine therapy (initial dose of 25 μg/day, titrated to 50–100 μg/day), while Groups 1 and 2 were treated with anti-seizure medications (valproic acid, 40 mg/kg/day). Neurological symptoms, including Babinski's reflex abnormalities (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 8.15, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and sensory disturbances (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 12.44, <i>p</i> = 0.005), were significantly more frequent in Group 2 than in Group 1. Cognitive test scores were significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 3 across all domains (<i>F</i>(2, 181) = 6.55, <i>p</i> = 0.002 for MMSE; <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 4.70, <i>p</i> = 0.010 for FAB; and <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 5.75, <i>p</i> = 0.006 for CDT), with Group 1 showing intermediate results. Regression analysis identified neurodegenerative disease risk (<i>β</i> = 0.34, CI: 0.20–0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), anemia (<i>β</i> = 0.32, CI: 0.15–0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and prolonged stress (<i>β</i> = 0.26, CI: 0.12–0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.002) as significant predictors of cognitive decline, while higher education was protective (<i>β</i> = −0.28, CI: −0.42 to −0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003). An inverse relationship was observed between TSH levels and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = −0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>In this study, we used immunoelectron microscopic methods combined with tract-tracing approaches to demonstrate that GluD1 is primarily expressed in the core of symmetric synapses formed by GABAergic terminals that originate from the lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus in the rodent and primate lateral habenula.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamate delta receptor 1 (GluD1) is a unique synaptogenic molecule expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that regulates negative reward prediction error and major monoaminergic systems, is enriched in GluD1. LHb dysfunction has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, both of which are associated with <i>GRID1</i>, the gene that encodes GluD1. Thus, disruption in GluD1 synaptic signaling may contribute to LHb dysfunction and the pathophysiology of LHb-associated disorders. Despite its strong cellular expression, little is known about the subsynaptic and subcellular localization of GluD1 in LHb neurons. Given that GluD1 is involved in the development and/or regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in various brain regions, a detailed map of GluD1 synaptic localization is essential to elucidate its role in the LHb. To address this issue, we used immunoelectron microscopy methods in rodents and monkeys. In both species, GluD1 immunoreactivity was primarily expressed in dendritic profiles, with lower expression in somata, spines, and glial elements. Pre- and post-embedding immunogold experiments revealed strong GluD1 expression in the core of symmetric GABAergic synapses. Albeit less frequent, GluD1 was also found at the edges (i.e., perisynaptic) of asymmetric, putative glutamatergic synapses. Through the combination of anterograde tracing with immunogold labeling in rats, we showed that axon terminals from the entopeduncular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus express postsynaptic GluD1 immunolabeling in the LHb. Our findings suggest that GluD1 may play a critical role in modulating GABAergic transmission in the rodent and primate LHb.</p>

">Seeking rhythmic patterns in microglial cells within the circadian pineal gland from male rats</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, constitute a highly dynamic cell population that displays several functions influenced by the light:dark (L:D) cycle. Within the pineal gland (PG), a key organ of the circadian timing system, microglia actively participate in its development and homeostasis. However, little is known about their rhythmic features in this circadian organ. This study aimed to elucidate morphological and functional phenotypes of pineal microglial cells at two time points of the L:D cycle. We performed immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy on paraffin-embedded pineal sections from 3- and 18-month-old Wistar rats, analyzing samples collected at midday (ZT6) and midnight (ZT18). Our results showed that the density and spatial distribution of IBA1+ microglial cells did not vary between ZT6 and ZT18 in the 3-month-old PG. However, these cells exhibited reduced size and amoeboid-like shapes, along with a reduction in the expression of the phagocytosis inhibitor SIRP alpha, at ZT18 compared to ZT6. Moreover, IBA1+ cells were immunoreactive for the lysosomal marker CD68 and the autophagic marker LC3B at both ZTs. Additionally, contacts with PAX6+ cells were detected in the two ZTs analyzed. Interestingly, IBA1+ cells showed attenuated or abolished rhythmicity in morphological parameters and SIRP alpha expression levels in the 18-month-old PG. Our findings suggest that microglia undergo transitions into alerted states at night, characterized by small, rounded shapes and enhanced phagocytic capacity. This adaptation likely prepares them to respond to potential invading agents and other insults in the PG, which could impact the nocturnal melatonin production.

">Respiration facilitates behaviour during multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                The brain processes information from the external environment alongside signals generated by the body. Among bodily rhythms, respiration emerges as a key modulator of sensory processing. Multisensory integration, the non-linear combination of information from multiple senses to reduce environmental uncertainty, may be influenced by respiratory dynamics. This study investigated how respiration modulates reaction times and multisensory integration in a simple detection task. Forty healthy participants were presented with unimodal (Auditory, Visual, Tactile) and bimodal (Audio-Tactile, Audio-Visual, Visuo-Tactile) stimuli while their respiratory activity was recorded. Results revealed that reaction times systematically varied with respiration, with faster responses during peak inspiration and early expiration but slower responses during the expiration-to-inspiration transition. Applying the race model inequality approach to quantify multisensory integration, we found that Audio-Tactile and Audio-Visual stimuli exhibited the highest integration during the expiration-to-inspiration phase. These findings conceivably reflect respiration phase-locked changes in cortical excitability which in turn, orchestrates multisensory integration. Interestingly, participants also tended to adapt their respiratory cycles, aligning response onsets preferentially with early expiration. This suggests that, rather than a mere bottom-up mechanism, respiration is actively adjusted to maximise the signal-to-noise balance between interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.

">Non-mutated human tau stimulates Alzheimer's disease-relevant neurodegeneration in a microglia-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The accumulation of abnormal, non-mutated tau protein is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite its strong association with disease progression, the mechanisms by which tau drives neurodegeneration in the brain remain poorly understood. Here, we selectively expressed non-mutated or mutated human microtubule-associated protein tau (hMAPT) in neurons across the brain and observed neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, especially associated with non-mutated human tau. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing confirmed a selective loss of hippocampal excitatory neurons by the wild-type tau and revealed the upregulation of neurodegeneration-related pathways in the affected populations. The accumulation of phosphorylated tau was accompanied by cellular stress in neurons and reactive gliosis in multiple brain regions. Notably, the lifelong absence of microglia significantly and differentially influenced the extent of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and thalamus. Therefore, our study established an AD-relevant tauopathy mouse model, elucidated both neuron-intrinsic and neuron-extrinsic responses, and highlighted critical and complex roles of microglia in modulating tau-driven neurodegeneration.

">The Neurocognitive efficiency score: Derivation, validation, and application of a novel combination of concurrent electrophysiological and behavioral data</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual and cognitive work require the expenditure of brain energy, and the efficiency of that energy expenditure can vary as a function of a range of exogenous and endogenous factors. The same is true for physical work, and tools have been developed to quantify energetic efficiency in the performance of physical work. The same is not true for the study of perceptual and cognitive work. We here draw on two lines of research---the formal characterization of workload capacity in perception and cognition, and the study of physical work---to propose a novel measure of neurocognitive efficiency. This neurocognitive efficiency score (NES) combines reaction time data with measures on concurrently acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) data to form a ratio that can be interpreted in terms of work accomplished relative to energy. We consider three measures on the EEG and show that one of them---global field power (GFP)---evidences a strong relationship to measures of metabolic energy expended. We then show how the NES can provide insights into differences in perceptual performance as a function of biological state. We argue that the NES has the potential for a wide range of applications in the study of perception and cognition in the context of factors including (but not limited to) aging, disease, stress, and differences in levels of expertise.

">Enhancer Dynamics and Spatial Organization Drive Anatomically Restricted Cellular States in the Human Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                Here, we report the spatial organization of RNA transcription and associated enhancer dynamics in the human spinal cord at single-cell and single-molecule resolution. We expand traditional multiomic measurements to reveal epigenetically poised and bivalent active transcriptional enhancer states that define cell type specification. Simultaneous detection of chromatin accessibility and histone modifications in spinal cord nuclei reveals previously unobserved cell-type specific cryptic enhancer activity, in which transcriptional activation is uncoupled from chromatin accessibility. Such cryptic enhancers define both stable cell type identity and transitions between cells undergoing differentiation. We also define glial cell gene regulatory networks that reorganize along the rostrocaudal axis, revealing anatomical differences in gene regulation. Finally, we identify the spatial organization of cells into distinct cellular organizations and address the functional significance of this observation in the context of paracrine signaling. We conclude that cellular diversity is best captured through the lens of enhancer state and intercellular interactions that drive transitions in cellular state. This study provides fundamental insights into the cellular organization of the healthy human spinal cord.

	<p>Background: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most dreaded complication after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57&amp;amp;ndash;1.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78&amp;amp;ndash;1.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80&amp;amp;ndash;2.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27&amp;amp;ndash;24.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90&amp;amp;ndash;1.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;2.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes. Concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis and the use of MT in the extended therapeutic window do not raise the risk of sICH.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have shown that multiple post-traumatic irradiations of the cochlea with near-infrared light (NIR) can significantly reduce noise-induced hearing loss. However, a single NIR pre-treatment was shown to have the same effect. Extending the pre-treatment time did not result in any further reduction in hearing loss. The present study investigated whether a combined NIR pre- and post-treatment had an increased effect on hearing preservation. Methods: Frequency-specific auditory brainstem potential thresholds (ABR) were determined in young adult mice. One group (n = 8) underwent NIR irradiation (808 nm, 120 mW, 15 min) of the cochlea, followed by a 30 min noise exposure (5&amp;amp;ndash;20 kHz, 115 dB SPL). A post-NIR treatment was administered for 30 min immediately following the noise trauma. After 14 days, hearing loss was determined by ABR measurements. The results were compared with a trauma-only group (n = 8) and an untreated control group (n = 5). Subsequently, the spiral ganglion neuron density was investigated. Results: A peri-traumatic NIR treatment resulted in a significantly lower hearing loss compared to the trauma-only group. Hearing protection in these animals significantly exceeded the effect of an exclusive pre- or post-treatment across all frequencies. A loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the trauma-only group was observed, which was significantly rescued by the peri-traumatic NIR treatment. Conclusions: A single peri-traumatic NIR treatment seems to be the more effective approach for the preservation of hearing thresholds after noise trauma compared to an isolated pre- or post-treatment. One target of the protective effect seems to be the spiral ganglion.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life.</p>

	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                The splenic localization of hydatid cysts is extremely rare. A 50-year-old obese female who consults with a painful and febrile syndrome of the right hypochondrium. Abdominal ultrasound and a CT scan computed tomography revealed a complete situs inversus, a mass of the right hypochondrium measuring 152 mm with membrane detachment, and infiltration of the surrounding fat, evoking a type II complicated splenic hydatic cyst. The patient was operated on in an emergency via midline laparotomy. Exploration revealed situs inversus, an angiant cyst of the spleen. Exposition of the splenic pedicle is difficult. The samples were then infected. Total splenectomy was performed. The postoperative period was unproblematic, and the patient was discharged with antibiotic and antiparasitic treatment and habitual vaccination.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).

                Abstract* Background This study investigates how perceived work alienation influences whistleblowing intention, with religious political orientation as a mediator and social value orientation as a moderator. Previous research has shown work alienation negatively correlates with prosocial behavior and activism while positively correlating with knowledge hiding. The study proposes that work alienation negatively predicts whistleblowing intention, with both religious political orientation and social value orientation playing influential roles in this relationship. Methods Predictive correlational design with a mediation and moderation analysis was used in this study. The participants of this study were 263 Indonesians (131 males, 132 females; M age = 25.91 years old; SD age = 5.47 years). Results The findings confirm that higher work alienation leads to lower whistleblowing intention. While religious political orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention as hypothesized, the study revealed that prosocial-type social value orientation weakens the negative relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention. The individualistic type showed no significant moderating effect. Conclusion The research demonstrates that work alienation significantly predicts whistleblowing intention, with prosocial social value orientation serving as a buffer against the negative effects of work alienation on whistleblowing intention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological factors influencing whistleblowing behavior in corruption prevention and eradication efforts.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices. By promoting collaborative care approaches, these educational resources can contribute to better preventive practices, potentially reducing the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

                Background The deductive system of BCL-algebra has not been thoroughly explored, and its fuzzification remains undefined. This study aims to the association of this gap by introducing a fuzzy extension of the deductive system of BCL-algebra using Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Methods We define a Pythagorean fuzzy set as a pair of membership and non-membership functions, where the sum of their squares lies between 0 and 1. These functions are used to extend the classical deductive system of BCL-algebra, allowing for reasoning based on fuzzy degrees. The system incorporates fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement, while maintaining the structure of BCL-algebra. We also introduce key components such as the accuracy function, score function, degree of indeterminacy, and square deviation to measure the certainty, truth, uncertainty, and deviation of fuzzy sets. Results We prove that the intersection of two Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems remains a valid Pythagorean fuzzy deductive system within BCL-algebra. However, we show that the union of such systems does not necessarily form a valid fuzzy deductive system. The study also provides detailed proofs using induction, logical derivations, and algebraic techniques. Conclusion The results disclose that while the intersection of Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems preserves the system's structure, the union does not, offering new insights into the behavior and limitations of fuzzy systems in BCL-algebra.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

                <p>by Ahmed Daoud, Asa Ben-Hur</p>

Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA language model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.

Transfer learning aims to integrate useful information from multi-source datasets to improve the learning performance of target data. This can be effectively applied in genomics when we learn the gene associations in a target tissue, and data from other tissues can be integrated. However, heavy-tail distribution and outliers are common in genomics data, which poses challenges to the effectiveness of current transfer learning approaches. In this paper, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional linear models with t-distributed error (Trans-PtLR), which aims to improve the estimation and prediction of target data by borrowing information from useful source data and offering robustness to accommodate complex data with heavy tails and outliers. In the oracle case with known transferable source datasets, a transfer learning algorithm based on penalized maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithm is established. To avoid including non-informative sources, we propose to select the transferable sources based on cross-validation. Extensive simulation experiments as well as an application demonstrate that Trans-PtLR demonstrates robustness and better performance of estimation and prediction when heavy-tail and outliers exist compared to transfer learning for linear regression model with normal error distribution.

Computational models are complex scientific constructs that have become essential for us to better understand the world. Many models are valuable for peers within and beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, there are no widely agreed-upon standards for sharing models. This paper suggests 10 simple rules for you to both (i) ensure you share models in a way that is at least “good enough,” and (ii) enable others to lead the change towards better model-sharing practices.

                <p>by Julien Laussu, Deborah Michel, Léa Magne, Stephane Segonds, Steven Marguet, Dimitri Hamel, Muriel Quaranta-Nicaise, Frederick Barreau, Emmanuel Mas, Vincent Velay, Florian Bugarin, Audrey Ferrand</p>

Understanding the interplay between biology and mechanics in tissue architecture is challenging, particularly in terms of 3D tissue organization. Addressing this challenge requires a biological model enabling observations at multiple levels from cell to tissue, as well as theoretical and computational approaches enabling the generation of a synthetic model that is relevant to the biological model and allowing for investigation of the mechanical stresses experienced by the tissue. Using a monolayer human colon epithelium organoid as a biological model, freely available tools (Fiji, Cellpose, Napari, Morphonet, or Tyssue library), and the commercially available Abaqus FEM solver, we combined vertex and FEM approaches to generate a comprehensive viscoelastic finite element model of the human colon organoid and demonstrated its flexibility. We imaged human colon organoid development for 120 hours, following the evolution of the organoids from an immature to a mature morphology. According to the extracted architectural/geometric parameters of human colon organoids at various stages of tissue architecture establishment, we generated organoid active vertex models. However, this approach did not consider the mechanical aspects involved in the organoids’ morphological evolution. Therefore, we applied a finite element method considering mechanical loads mimicking osmotic pressure, external solicitation, or active contraction in the vertex model by using the Abaqus FEM solver. Integration of finite element analysis (FEA) into the vertex model achieved a better fit with the biological model. Therefore, the FEM model provides a basis for depicting cell shape, tissue deformation, and cellular-level strain due to imposed stresses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a combination of vertex and FEM approaches, combining geometrical and mechanical parameters, improves modeling of alterations in organoid morphology over time and enables better assessment of the mechanical cues involved in establishing the architecture of the human colon epithelium.

The structure of the early metabolic network is unknown. Here, we report that when considered together, pentose utilization pathways form all life-essential precursors. We speculate that the chemistry preserved in pentose metabolism could therefore have been a central structural element in early metabolism.

                This study explored the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce across Nigeria and selected developing countries, applying a holistic health perspective through a structured review and quantitative synthesis of available research published between 2006 and 2022. Following PRISMA standards, a pre-specified protocol for the review was designed and documented in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42024521833). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Data were extracted using standardized protocols, and pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. The overall prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3-10.8%), with higher contamination in West Africa (10.5%) compared to Southeast Asia (5.2%). Leafy vegetables exhibited the highest contamination (12.1%). Molecular detection via PCR had higher detecting sensitivity (11.6%) compared to traditional culture methods (7.3%). The analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 97.79%, p < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in the reported prevalence of Listeria spp. Environmental factors, such as temperature and poor agricultural practices, contributed to contamination. These findings underscore the need for robust hygiene controls and monitoring to mitigate L. monocytogenes risks in fresh produce.

                Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healthcare approaches in the world, underpinning the interdependency of mind, body, and spirit in encouraging harmony and preventing disease. The safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda were explored systematically through this review in various global contexts, including its historical development, current practice, and epidemiological trends. This study assesses the integration of Ayurveda into healthcare systems by analyzing experiences in India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East and its potential to contribute to global health challenges. As Ayurveda’s originator, India has established a robust regulatory framework, extensive clinical research, and government policy support for its integration into mainstream medicine. Evidence supports the efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies, such as Panchakarma and herbal formulations, for treating chronic diseases with minimal side effects. Ayurveda has entered the fold of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States and Germany. Ayurveda treatments have been shown to be effective in various conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, although regulatory inconsistencies and quality assurance remain significant barriers. There is a cultural affinity towards traditional medicine in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, leading to a growing adoption supported by collaborative initiatives and research. Despite the globally relevant Ayurveda, the non-uniform nature of regulatory standards, lack of large-scale clinical trials, and standardization of formulations form barriers to its more general acceptance. Recommendations for the future include fostering interdisciplinary research, harmonizing regulation, and leveraging digital health in furthering personalized medicine. This study underscores Ayurveda’s transformative potential in global healthcare, advocating sustainable, patient-centered solutions to address chronic and emerging health issues.

                Background Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-59/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical and cultural approaches to managing hematocolpos in adolescents: A Tunisian case report with video insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hematocolpos is a gynecological disorder characterized by the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina due to anatomical obstruction, often resulting from an imperforate hymen (IH), the most common etiology in approximately 90% of cases. This condition can remain undiagnosed until adolescence, when menarche triggers clinical symptoms such as cyclical lower abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea, and in severe cases, a rapidly enlarging pelvic mass. Complications may include urinary retention, constipation, and infection if not promptly treated. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term consequences such as endometriosis, retrograde menstruation, and infertility. In Tunisia, the hymen holds significant cultural and social value, symbolizing virginity and moral purity, complicating the surgical management of hematocolpos. This case report discusses the surgical and cultural considerations involved in the treatment of a 13-year-old Tunisian girl diagnosed with hematocolpos. A hymen-sparing hymenotomy was selected, preserving the hymenal ring while creating an adequate orifice for menstrual flow, ensuring a balance between medical treatment and cultural sensitivities. The procedure, which included drainage of 600 ml of retained blood and meticulous suturing to maintain the hymen’s appearance, was successful. The patient experienced regular menstrual cycles and expressed satisfaction with the outcome 12 months postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of providing culturally sensitive care in regions where the hymen holds symbolic value. Virginity-sparing surgical techniques offer a suitable approach that addresses both medical and social concerns, ensuring patient well-being while respecting cultural beliefs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-58/v1?src=rss">Social pain: A systematic review on interventions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Social pain is emotional distress caused harm or threat to social connections that results in social exclusion, rejection, or loss. Social Pain is also a potentiator of physical pain. Supportive social relationships are widely recognized for their impact on maintaining health and well-being. The Passion of Jesus Christ serves as a quintessential example of social pain (i.e., desertion, betrayal, denial) potentiating physical pain (i.e., beatings, Crown of Thorns, crucifixion). Christ opts to forgive. Although forgiveness is one solution to reduce social pain, other interventions exist. This review seeks to identify and summarize interventions associated with reducing social pain. We conducted a systematic review using Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant articles. Results: The database searches produced 548 articles. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Acetaminophen, both deceptive and open-label placebos, mindfulness training, and psilocybin were found to reduce social pain. Of note, the combination of acetaminophen and forgiveness yielded superior results compared to either acetaminophen or forgiveness alone. Pharmacological interventions operate on the premise that the neural pathways responsible for physical pain also play a role in social pain. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for reducing social pain.

                Ramakrishnan et al. deleted AMPK in a spontaneous breast cancer metastasis mouse model and metastatic cell lines and showed that it is required for breast cancer metastasis. AMPK is required to mitigate ROS levels by generating NADPH, and thus, antioxidants could restore metastasis in AMPK-deficient cells.

                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/75393">Oversized cells activate global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating animal cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (S. Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101523">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neuron during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amyplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92979">Surprising features of nuclear receptor interaction networks revealed by live-cell single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) require heterodimerization with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), to bind cognate DNA recognition sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97731">Mapping patterns of thought onto brain activity during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Movie-watching is a central aspect of our lives and an important paradigm for understanding the brain mechanisms behind cognition as it occurs in daily life. Contemporary views of ongoing thought argue that the ability to make sense of events in the ‘here and now’ depend on the neural processing of incoming sensory information by auditory and visual cortex, which are kept in check by systems in association cortex. However, we currently lack an understanding of how patterns of ongoing thoughts map onto the different brain systems when we watch a film, partly because methods of sampling experience disrupt the dynamics of brain activity and the experience of movie-watching. Our study established a novel method for mapping thought patterns onto the brain activity that occurs at different moments of a film, which does not disrupt the time course of brain activity or the movie-watching experience. We found moments when experience sampling highlighted engagement with multi-sensory features of the film or highlighted thoughts with episodic features, regions of sensory cortex were more active and subsequent memory for events in the movie was better—on the other hand, periods of intrusive distraction emerged when activity in regions of association cortex within the frontoparietal system was reduced. These results highlight the critical role sensory systems play in the multi-modal experience of movie-watching and provide evidence for the role of association cortex in reducing distraction when we watch films.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83973">Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96600">The protective roles of eugenol on type 1 diabetes mellitus through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95135">The NeuroML ecosystem for standardized multi-scale modeling in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.

	<p>Backgrounds and Objectives: Obesity presents a significant global public health challenge and is associated with declines in both general and food-related inhibitory control, crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity progression. An increasing body of research suggests that acute aerobic exercise may improve inhibitory function. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of acute aerobic exercise on both general and food-related inhibition in obese adults remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential impacts and underlying neuroelectronic mechanisms of a single session of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on general and food-related inhibitory functions among young adult males with obesity. Design: A within-subject design comprising three sessions (control, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise) &amp;amp;times; three picture types (high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral picture) was employed. Methods: Eighteen young adult males with obesity [body mass index (BMI): 34.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.21 kg/m2, aged 24.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.13 years (Mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD)] were recruited. They participated in three intervention sessions: acute aerobic exercise at low [40&amp;amp;ndash;50% maximal Heart Rate (HRmax)], moderate (65&amp;amp;ndash;70% HRmax), and a control session (sitting rest), separated by five-day intervals in a counterbalanced order. Following each session, participants performed a food-related Go/No-go task, and EEG recordings (N2 and P3 components) were conducted within 15 min. Results: Moderate-intensity exercise elicited larger N2 amplitudes compared to the control session across different picture types and task conditions. However, there was no significant effect on behavioral indicators or P3 amplitude across sessions. Additionally, food stimuli (both high- and low-calorie) resulted in lower No-go accuracy and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Acute moderate-intensity exercise might influence general and food-related inhibitory function in obese individuals at the neuroelectric stage, potentially by enhancing attentional resources for managing cognitive control and conflict detection. Moreover, reduced N2 amplitudes and No-go accuracy in response to food stimuli compared to non-food stimuli indicate a diminished ability to allocate attentional and neural resources to manage food-related conflicts. However, due to the relatively small sample size, caution is advised when generalizing these findings to the broader population. The pilot test indicated that obese participants had difficulty sustaining high-intensity exercise at 80&amp;amp;ndash;90% of their maximum heart rate for a continuous or 20 min period, highlighting potential challenges in exercise adherence at high intensities within this population. Future research is needed to utilize interdisciplinary approaches and multimodal technologies to clarify how exercise influences food-related cognition, appetite regulation, and brain mechanisms in obesity, aiming to better contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) often requires surgical intervention, such as craniotomy, to relieve mass lesions and pressure. The extent of hematoma evacuation significantly impacts patient outcomes. This study utilizes 3D Slicer software to analyse post-craniotomy hematoma volume changes and evaluate their prognostic significance in aSDH patients. Methods: Among 178 adult patients diagnosed with aSDH from January 2015 to December 2022, 64 underwent hematoma evacuation via craniotomy. Initial scans were performed within 24 h of trauma, followed by routine postoperative scans to assess residual hematoma. We conducted radiomic analysis of preoperative and postoperative volumes, surface area, Feret diameter, sphericity, flatness, and elongation. Clinical parameters, including SOFA score, APACHE score, pupillary response, comorbidities, age, anticoagulation status, and preoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, were also evaluated. Results: Changes in &amp;amp;Delta; surface area significantly correlated with 30-day outcomes (p = 0.03) and showed moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65). Patients with a &amp;amp;Delta; surface area &amp;amp;gt; 30,090 mm2 experienced poorer outcomes (OR = 6.66, p = 0.02). Significant features included preoperative surface area (p = 0.009), Feret diameter (p = 0.0012). In multivariate analysis, only the Feret diameter remained significant (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Postoperative &amp;amp;Delta; surface area is, among other variables, a strong predictor of 30-day outcomes, while in multivariate analysis, preoperative Feret diameter remains the only independent predictor. Radiomic analysis with 3D Slicer may enhance prognostic accuracy and inform tailored therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect effects through cognitive planning&amp;amp;mdash;mainly as rule violation total score&amp;amp;mdash;on specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize people by their faces. Developmental prosopagnosia is the hereditary or congenital variant of the condition. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the assessment of developmental prosopagnosia in a clinical context, using a combination of commercially available clinical assessment tools and experimental tools described in the research literature. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of a man with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient (ON) had experienced difficulties with face identity recognition throughout his life but believed they were caused by a lack of interest in others. Results: The neuropsychological assessment revealed varying degrees of difficulties primarily related to executive functions, attention, reaction time, and memory processes, as expected in a person with Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome and ADHD. In addition, ON reported severe problems with face recognition on a prosopagnosia questionnaire and demonstrated severely impaired performance on tests of face memory and face perception commonly used to diagnose prosopagnosia. Interestingly, he reported familial face recognition problems on the maternal side of the family, while tics and ADHD symptoms occurred on the paternal side. This suggests that, in this case, the conditions were likely inherited through different genetic pathways. Conclusions: Proper assessment of face recognition problems, which includes a broad spectrum of clinical assessment tools, could help patients develop awareness and acceptance of themselves and their difficulties, and could serve as a basis for the development of clinical interventions. While ON&amp;amp;rsquo;s DP, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD may have distinct genetic origins, impairment in face identity recognition has been observed across several neurodevelopmental conditions and is likely more common than currently thought.</p>

                <p>The full complement of ion channels which influence insect auditory mechanotransduction and the mechanisms by which their influence is exerted remain unclear. <I>Shal</I> (K<SUB>v</SUB>4), a <I>Shaker</I> family member encoding voltage-gated potassium channels in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, has been shown to localize to dendrites in some neuron types, suggesting the potential role of <I>Shal</I> in <I>Drosophila</I> hearing, including mechanotransduction. A GFP trap was used to visualize the localization of the <I>Shal</I> channel in Johnston's organ neurons responsible for hearing in the antenna. <I>Shal</I> protein was localized strongly to the cell body and inner dendritic segment of sensory neurons. It was also detectable in the sensory cilium, suggesting its involvement not only in general auditory function but specifically in mechanotransduction. Electrophysiological recordings to assess neural responses to auditory stimuli in mutant <I>Shal</I> flies revealed significant decreases in auditory responses. Laser Doppler vibrometer recordings indicated abnormal antennal free fluctuation frequencies in mutant lines, indicating an effect on active antennal tuning, and thus active transduction mechanisms. This suggests that <I>Shal</I> participates in coordinating energy-dependent antennal movements in <I>Drosophila</I> that are essential for tuning the antenna to courtship song frequencies.</p>

                <p>The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance use, which is often modeled in rodents using operant conditioning. However, most operant chambers only accommodate one rodent at a time. We present PeerPub&mdash;a unique social operant chamber. PeerPub employs touch sensors to track the licking behavior on drinking spouts. When the number of licks meets a set reinforcement schedule, it dispenses a drop of solution with a fixed volume as a reward at the tip of the spout. A radio frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted in each rat&rsquo;s skull identifies it throughout the experiment. The system is managed by a Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluated PeerPub using Sprague Dawley rats in daily 1&nbsp;h sessions, where supersac (a glucose and saccharin solution) was provided under a fixed-ratio five schedule. We discovered that male rats consumed more supersac in dual rat conditions compared with single rat conditions. These findings illustrate PeerPub&rsquo;s effectiveness in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We expect devices like PeerPub will help highlight the role of social environments in substance use disorder phenotypes. All computer code, 3D design, and build instructions for PeerPub can be found at <A HREF="http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub">http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub</A>.</p>

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, this research protocol depicts our proposed study assessing the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In the planned comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the planned comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for the prevention of HPV-related diseases later in life. However, HPV vaccination uptake remains suboptimal in this population. This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting parents and parent-adolescent dyads in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the impact of parent-directed and parent-adolescent dyad interventions on HPV vaccination uptake in children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Specific objectives include reviewing existing literature on parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions, assessing vaccination uptake, identifying influencing factors, and providing evidence-based recommendations for intervention development and implementation. Methods A systematic review will be conducted, encompassing literature published up to the present day. Various databases will be searched for relevant studies on parent-focused and parent-adolescent dyad interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination uptake. Data extraction and analysis will be performed to assess the proportion of children and adolescents receiving HPV vaccination following interventions, factors influencing vaccination uptake, and completion rates of the recommended vaccine series. Results The review findings will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect size of interventions. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Conclusion This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents. The findings will inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions to address barriers and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases.

                Background Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients has gained significant attention; however, its impact on long-term survival and recurrence rates remains under investigation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of NAC on metastasis, recurrence rates, and overall survival in BC patients. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to assess differences between groups. Methods In this retrospective study, 46 Sudanese patients with locally advanced BC were consecutively collected attending Alsharif Specialized Hospital during the period from 2015 to 2016, comprising 28 patients who received NAC (case group) and 18 patients who underwent upfront surgery (control group). Data regarding demographics, histological types, treatment regimens, prognostic markers, survival, recurrence and metastasis were collected Results Most of patients in both groups were > 40 years old. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the predominant histological type observed. Notably, the metastasis rate was lower in the case group than in the control group (n=6; 21.4% vs. n=9; 50%, P = 0.043). However, the recurrence rates and overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.353 and P = 0.454, respectively). The estimated mean survival time was 74.1 months for the case group compared to 82.0 months for the control group, but without significant difference (log-rank P = 0.973). Conclusion While NAC appears to reduce metastasis rates in breast cancer patients, it does not significantly impact recurrence rates or overall survival. These results underscore the need for further research to explore additional factors that influence long-term outcomes of breast cancer management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-54/v1?src=rss">Applications of MR Finger printing derived T1 and T2 values in Adult brain: A Systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for brain imaging, but conventional methods rely on qualitative contrast, are time-intensive, and prone to variability. Magnetic resonance finger printing (MRF) addresses these limitations by enabling fast, simultaneous mapping of multiple tissue properties like T1, T2. Using dynamic acquisition parameters and a precomputed signal dictionary, MRF provides robust, qualitative maps, improving diagnostic precision and expanding clinical and research applications in brain imaging. Methods Database searches were performed through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of science to identify relevant articles focusing on the application of MR finger printing in the adult brain. We utilized the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines to extract data from the selected studies. Results Nine articles were included in the final review, with a total sample size of 332 participants. In healthy brains, notable regional, sex, age, and hemispheric variations were identified, particularly in the corpus callosum and thalamus. MRF effectively differentiated meningioma subtypes, glioma grades, and IDH mutation status, with T2 values providing particularly predictive for glioma classification. In brain metastases, significant relaxometry differences were noted between normal and lesional tissues. For multiple sclerosis, MRF values correlated with clinical and disability measures, distinguishing relapsing-remitting secondary progressive forms. In traumatic brain injury, longitudinal T1 changes strongly correlated with clinical recovery, surpassing T2 values. Conclusions The systematic review highlighted MRD as a groundbreaking technique that enhances neurological diagnosis by simultaneously quantifying T1 and T2 relaxation times. With reduced acquisition times, MRF outperforms conventional MRI in detecting subtle pathologies, distinguishing properties, and providing reliable biomarkers.

                Background Good animal welfare is important ethically but also to ensure animals provide valid scientific models. Despite thousands of amphibians in research laboratories there is minimal quantitative evidence pertaining to their management and welfare. This study validated methods to non-invasively measure corticosterone, the amphibian ‘stress’ hormone, from tank water to provide a robust and reliable welfare assessment tool. Methods We report experiments (A) that evaluate parameters linked to the performance of our biochemical extraction methods for waterborne corticosterone and, importantly, associated sampling procedures. We evaluate appropriate sampling water type, sampling vessel, filtration methods, potential degradation of waterborne corticosterone over time and the impact of sampling procedures on animal corticosterone levels. We wanted to determine sampling parameters that yielded the least background corticosterone and had minimum negative impact on the animals. The second series of experiments (B) evaluated parameters linked to the biology of Xenopus, including the influence of circadian rhythm, sex and snout-vent length on waterborne corticosterone levels, since fundamental knowledge of a species’ biology is essential for designing robust experiments and in the interpretation of the results. Results We propose collecting corticosterone samples in deionised water in either plastic or glass containers. The filtering process does not impact the amount of corticosterone measured in the water sample. Levels of corticosterone collected in the water change over a 48-hr period so we advocate standardising time from hormone collection to storage at - 20 °C. Repeated transfer of frogs to sampling containers does not increase corticosterone, suggesting our methods are not cumulatively stressful. Corticosterone levels were not impacted by circadian phase, sex or snout-vent length. Conclusion We have developed and validated robust methods to quantify waterborne corticosterone. We hope they provide a template for researchers wishing to develop methods to measure waterborne corticosterone in aquatic amphibians.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyi Wang, Zhen Jin</p>

Human mobility between different regions is a major factor in large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Deep learning models incorporating infectious disease transmission dynamics for predicting the spread of multi-regional outbreaks due to human mobility have become a hot research topic. In this study, we incorporate the Graph Transformer Neural Network and graph learning mechanisms into a metapopulation SIR model to build a hybrid framework, Metapopulation Graph Transformer Neural Network (M-Graphormer), for high-dimensional parameter estimation and multi-regional epidemic prediction. The framework effectively solves the problem that existing models may lose some hidden spatial dependencies in the data when dealing with the dynamic graph structure of the network due to human mobility. We performed multi-wave infectious disease prediction in multiple regions based on real epidemic data. The results show that the framework is capable of performing high-dimensional parameter estimation and accurately predicting epidemic transmission dynamics in multiple regions even with low data quality. In addition, we retrospectively extrapolate the temporal evolution patterns of contact rate under different interventions implemented in different regions, reflecting the dynamics of intervention intensity and the need for flexibility in adjusting interventions in different regions. To provide early warning of infectious disease transmission, we retrospectively predicted the arrival time of infectious diseases using data from the early stages of outbreaks.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for computational analysis in the biomedical sciences, with its effectiveness significantly enhanced by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This integration has give rise to informed machine learning, in contrast to studies that lack domain knowledge and treat all variables equally (uninformed machine learning). While the application of informed machine learning to bioinformatics and health informatics datasets has become more seamless, the likelihood of errors has also increased. To address this drawback, we present eight guidelines outlining best practices for employing informed machine learning methods in biomedical sciences. These quick tips offer recommendations on various aspects of informed machine learning analysis, aiming to assist researchers in generating more robust, explainable, and dependable results. Even if we originally crafted these eight simple suggestions for novices, we believe they are deemed relevant for expert computational researchers as well.

                <p>by Amrit Bagchi, Bapi Sarker, Jialiang Zhang, Marcus Foston, Amit Pathak</p>

Cell collectives, like other motile entities, generate and use forces to move forward. Here, we ask whether environmental configurations alter this proportional force-speed relationship, since aligned extracellular matrix fibers are known to cause directed migration. We show that aligned fibers serve as active conduits for spatial propagation of cellular mechanotransduction through matrix exoskeleton, leading to efficient directed collective cell migration. Epithelial (MCF10A) cell clusters adhered to <i>soft</i> substrates with aligned collagen fibers (AF) migrate faster with much lesser traction forces, compared to random fibers (RF). Fiber alignment causes higher motility waves and transmission of normal stresses deeper into cell monolayer while minimizing shear stresses and increased cell-division based fluidization. By contrast, fiber randomization induces cellular jamming due to breakage in motility waves, disrupted transmission of normal stresses, and heightened shear driven flow. Using a novel motor-clutch model, we explain that such ‘force-effective’ fast migration phenotype occurs due to rapid stabilization of contractile forces at the migrating front, enabled by higher frictional forces arising from simultaneous compressive loading of parallel fiber-substrate connections. We also model ‘<i>haptotaxis</i>’ to show that increasing ligand connectivity (but not continuity) increases migration efficiency. According to our model, increased rate of front stabilization via higher resistance to substrate deformation is sufficient to capture ‘<i>durotaxis’</i>. Thus, our findings reveal a new paradigm wherein the rate of leading-edge stabilization determines the efficiency of supracellular collective cell migration.

                <p>by Kwang Su Kim, Masashi Iwamoto, Kosaku Kitagawa, Hyeongki Park, Sanae Hayashi, Senko Tsukuda, Takeshi Matsui, Masanori Atsukawa, Kentaro Matsuura, Natthaya Chuaypen, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Lena Allweiss, Takara Nishiyama, Naotoshi Nakamura, Yasuhisa Fujita, Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Masamichi Muramatsu, Kazuyuki Aihara, Takaji Wakita, Alan S.

Quantification of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key for evaluating an elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in infected patients. However, quantifying cccDNA requires invasive methods such as a liver biopsy, which makes it impractical to access the dynamics of cccDNA in patients. Although HBV RNA and HBV core-related antigens (HBcrAg) have been proposed as surrogate markers for evaluating cccDNA activity, they do not necessarily estimate the amount of cccDNA. Here, we employed a recently developed multiscale mathematical model describing intra- and intercellular viral propagation and applied it in HBV-infected patients under treatment. We developed a model that can predict intracellular HBV dynamics by use of extracellular viral markers, including HBsAg, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg in peripheral blood. Importantly, the model prediction of the amount of cccDNA in patients over time was confirmed to be well correlated with the data for quantified cccDNA by paired liver biopsy. Thus, our method combining classic and emerging surrogate markers enables us to predict the decay dynamics of cccDNA in patients undergoing treatment.

<p>Fossils work well for reconstructing the evolutionary history of brain shape and size but are mute to the evolution of subcortical structures. Leveraging the use of scaling attributes, simulation and 3D mapping we predict subcortical anatomy for fossil Carnivora. These data help to expand the search space for paleoneurological study.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Paleoneurology reconstructs the evolutionary history of nervous systems through direct observations from the fossil record and comparative data from extant species. Although this approach can provide direct evidence of phylogenetic links among species, it is constrained by the availability and quality of data that can be gleaned from the fossil record. Here, we sought to translate brain component relationships in a sample of extant Carnivora to make inferences about brain structure in fossil species. Using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging on extant canids and felids and 3D laser scanning on fossil Carnivora, spanning some 40 million years of evolution, we derived measurements for select brain components. From these primary data, predictive equations of cortical (gray matter mass, cortical thickness, and gyrification index) and subcortical structures (caudate nucleus, putamen, and external globus pallidus mass) were used to derive estimates for select fossil Carnivora. We found that regression equations based on both extant and simulation samples provided moderate to high predictability of subcortical masses for fossil Carnivora. We also found that using exploratory probabilistic mapping of subcortical structures in extant Carnivora, a reasonable prediction could be made of the 3D subcortical morphospace of fossil endocasts. These results identify allometric departures and establish adult species ranges in brain component size for fossil species. The integrative approach taken in this study may serve as a model to promote further dialog between neurobiologists working on extant Carnivora models and paleoneurologists describing the nervous system of fossils from this understudied group of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

                Background Glaucoma, the primary cause of irreversible blindness globally, mainly presents as primary open-angle glaucoma and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa. This chronic disease of the optic nerve often goes undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic early stages. Increased awareness and regular eye exams can help in early detection and management. Purpose/Objectives This study aims to comprehensively identify the existing literature on screening programs or interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at the primary healthcare level. Additionally, the study aims to outline the characteristics of these screening programs/interventions and emphasize the most successful programs that have been implemented at the primary healthcare level. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al. (2010) methodological enhancement for conducting a scoping review project. The search will cover peer-reviewed articles published in English between the inception and May 2024 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and the WHO Global Database. The search on the EBSCOhost platform will include databases such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with full text, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analyzed using QualCoder 1.9 version. The study findings will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and a checklist will be completed to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines. Conclusion This review will help identify research gaps in primary healthcare POAG screening programs and recommend effective interventions.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                Background Radiological case reports summarize the imaging characteristics of individual cases to identify patterns and valuable lessons. Their writing can be guided by the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines. However, the impact of following these guidelines, or not following them, on the quality and efficiency of radiological case reports writing remain unclear. Objective To examine whether following the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines, or not following any reporting guidelines, affects the quality and writing efficiency of radiological case reports. Protocol The purpose of this protocol is to outline the background and objectives of this study, as well as the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). We will design a three-arm, multicentre cRCT, targeting radiologists or radiology students from different medical institutions. The intervention include training on the CARE-radiology checklist; the second intervention involves training on the CARE checklist. The control group will follow standard procedures without any intervention. After the intervention, participants will be required to write a case report within a period of 10 days. The primary outcome measures will be the completeness and clarity of the case reports. Discussion This study aims to enhance the adherence of researchers to reporting guidelines for case reports through rigorous design. The results will be further explained and interpreted in the final trial outcomes. Registration This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with the registration number: ChiCTR2400089973.

                Background Intestinal parasitoses are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa, with a prevalence of 42.18%. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitoses remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: Entamoeba H., the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by Trichomonas I. and Giardia L. with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. Ascaris L. had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by Schistosoma M., Ankylostoma D., and Enterobius V. with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher during the dry season. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

                Objective To develop predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare personnel (n=430) who transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand during 2023-2024. The SVM model evaluated 37 predictor variables spanning demographic characteristics, benefits, and welfare domains. Four kernel functions were compared to identify optimal model performance, and feature importance analysis was conducted to determine key predictors. Results The linear kernel demonstrated superior performance (accuracy: 71.43%, sensitivity: 49.02%, specificity: 85.37%) compared to other kernel functions. Analysis revealed five key predictors (feature weights >0.25): competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). While employee qualifications (0.236) emerged as a significant demographic predictor, organizational support factors, particularly financial incentives and professional development opportunities, showed stronger predictive power for transition success. Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Fu et al. discover a non-metabolic function of TKT in gliomas. Mechanistically, TKT undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following chemotherapy. Nuclear TKT interacts with XRN2 to prevent excessive R-loop accumulation, while depletion of TKT leads to increased R-loop accumulation and genome instability, potentiating chemotherapy efficacy.

                Novak et al. show how Miro1 regulates mitochondrial transfer from the tumor microenvironment to mtDNA-deficient melanoma cells. The authors argue that delayed tumor formation observed in Miro1KO mice results from impaired mitochondrial transfer, which involves reduced microtubule association, disruption of the mitochondrial network, and TNT formation.

                Transcription factor partners can cooperatively bind to DNA composite elements to augment gene transcription. Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. Using SPICE, we successfully identified known composite elements, such as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) and STAT5 tetramers, and also uncovered several novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements. One such novel interaction was identified at CNS9, an upstream conserved noncoding region in the human <i>IL10</i> gene, which harbors a non-canonical IKZF1 binding site. We confirmed the cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <i>IL10</i>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96784">Fractal cycles of sleep, a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles</a></h4>

              
                Sleep cycles are defined as episodes of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep followed by an episode of REM sleep. Fractal or aperiodic neural activity is a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages measured using electroencephalography. We introduce a new concept of ‘fractal cycles’ of sleep, defined as a time interval during which time series of fractal activity descend to their local minimum and ascend to the next local maximum. We assess correlations between fractal and classical (i.e. non-REM – REM) sleep cycle durations and study cycles with skipped REM sleep. The sample comprised 205 healthy adults, 21 children and adolescents and 111 patients with depression. We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89±34 vs 90±25 min) correlated positively (<i>r</i>=0.5, p&lt;0.001). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles than young adults (76±34 vs 94±32 min). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91–98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their unmedicated state (107±51 vs 92±38 min) and age-matched controls (104±49 vs 88±31 min). In conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95528">High-resolution awake mouse fMRI at 14 tesla</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 µm×100 µm×200 µm resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98742">Nitric oxide modulates contrast suppression in a subset of mouse retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators have major influences on the regulation of neural circuit activity across the nervous system. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a prominent neuromodulator in many circuits and has been extensively studied in the retina. Here, it has been associated with the regulation of light adaptation, gain control, and gap junctional coupling, but its effect on the retinal output, specifically on the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings to measure light-evoked activity of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer in the ex vivo mouse retina. This approach allowed us to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of NO on a cell type-level. Our findings reveal that NO selectively modulates the suppression of temporal responses in a distinct subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types, increasing their activity without altering the spatial properties of their receptive fields. Given that under photopic conditions, NO release is triggered by quick changes in light levels, we propose that these RGC types signal fast contrast changes to higher visual regions. Remarkably, we found that about one-third of the RGC types, recorded using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, exhibited consistent, cell type-specific adaptational response changes throughout an experiment, independent of NO. By employing a sequential-recording paradigm, we could disentangle those additional adaptational response changes from drug-induced modulations. Taken together, our research highlights the selective neuromodulatory effects of NO on RGCs and emphasizes the need of considering non-pharmacological activity changes, like adaptation, in such study designs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93183">A high-throughput platform for single-molecule tracking identifies drug interaction and cellular mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of cell physiology depends largely upon interactions of functionally distinct proteins and cellular components. These interactions may be transient or long-lived, but often affect protein motion. Measurement of protein dynamics within a cellular environment, particularly while perturbing protein function with small molecules, may enable dissection of key interactions and facilitate drug discovery; however, current approaches are limited by throughput with respect to data acquisition and analysis. As a result, studies using super-resolution imaging are typically drawing conclusions from tens of cells and a few experimental conditions tested. We addressed these limitations by developing a high-throughput single-molecule tracking (htSMT) platform for pharmacologic dissection of protein dynamics in living cells at an unprecedented scale (capable of imaging &gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/day and screening &gt;10<sup>4</sup> compounds). We applied htSMT to measure the cellular dynamics of fluorescently tagged estrogen receptor (ER) and screened a diverse library to identify small molecules that perturbed ER function in real time. With this one experimental modality, we determined the potency, pathway selectivity, target engagement, and mechanism of action for identified hits. Kinetic htSMT experiments were capable of distinguishing between on-target and on-pathway modulators of ER signaling. Integrated pathway analysis recapitulated the network of known ER interaction partners and suggested potentially novel, kinase-mediated regulatory mechanisms. The sensitivity of htSMT revealed a new correlation between ER dynamics and the ability of ER antagonists to suppress cancer cell growth. Therefore, measuring protein motion at scale is a powerful method to investigate dynamic interactions among proteins and may facilitate the identification and characterization of novel therapeutics.

	<p>Acute vertigo or dizziness is a frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED), making up between 2.1% and 4.4% of all consultations. Given the nature of the ED where the priority is triage, diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses are common, with as many as a third of vertebrobasilar strokes presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness being missed. Here, we review diagnostic errors identified in the evaluation and treatment of the acutely dizzy patient and discuss strategies to overcome them. Lessons learned include focusing on structured history taking, asking about timing and triggers to inform a targeted examination, assessing subtle ocular motor findings (e.g., by use of HINTS(+)), and avoiding overreliance on brain imaging (including early magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted sequences [DWI-MRI]). Importantly, up to 20% of DWI-MRI may be false negatives if obtained within the first 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h after symptom onset. Likewise, overreliance on focal neurologic findings to confirm a stroke diagnosis should be avoided because isolated dizziness, vertigo, or even unsteadiness may be the only symptoms in some patients with vertebrobasilar stroke. Furthermore, in patients with triggered episodic vestibular symptoms provocation maneuvers should be preferred over HINTS(+), and a potential diagnosis of stroke should not be immediately dismissed in younger patients presenting with a headache (where migraine may be more common), but the possibility of a vertebral artery dissection should be further evaluated. Importantly, moderate training of non-experts allows for significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy in the acutely dizzy patient and thus should be prioritized.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A neurobiological framework of bi- or multilingual neurocognitive development must consider the following: (i) longitudinal behavioral and neural measures; (ii) brain developmental constraints across structure and function; and (iii) the development of global multilingual competence in a homogeneous social environment. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual competence yields early changes in executive attention control mechanisms and their underlying neural structures in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal system, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplemental area and the left caudate. Methods: We employed longitudinal neuroimaging and functional connectivity methods in a small group of multilingual children over two years. Results: We found that the dACC/preSMA is functionally influenced by changes in multilingual competence but not yet structurally adapted, while the left caudate, in a developmental stage, is influenced, adapts, and specializes due to multilingual experience. Furthermore, increases in multilingual competence strengthen connections between the dACC/preSMA, left caudate, and other structures of the cognitive control network, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These findings suggest that multilingual competence impacts brain &amp;amp;ldquo;adaptation&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;specialization&amp;amp;rdquo; during childhood. The results may provide insights and guide future research on experience-expectant and experience-dependent brain plasticity to explain the &amp;amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;amp;rdquo; between multilingualism and neurodevelopment.</p>
