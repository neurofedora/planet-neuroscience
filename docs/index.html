              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of Npas1-neurons in the Ventral Pallidum Mediates Stress Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Background: Altered activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) underlies disrupted motivation after stress exposure. The VP is a very heterogeneous structure comprised of many different neuron types with distinct electrophysiological properties and projections. Neuronal PAS 1-positive (Npas1+) VP neurons are thought to send projections to brain regions critical for stress response. In this study, we evaluated how activity of VP Npas1+ neurons affect emotional behaviors and responses to social stress. Methods: We used a chemogenetic approach to manipulate VP Npas1+ neurons during social defeat stress (SDS) and behavioral tasks related to anxiety and motivation in Npas1-Cre mice. We employed a similar approach in females using the chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS). Finally, to characterize VP Npas1+ neuron circuitry and molecular identity we evaluated the projection targets of the VP Npas1+ neurons and performed RNA-seq on ribosome-associated mRNA from VP Npas1+ neurons. Results: Chemogenetic activation of VP Npas1+ neurons increased susceptibility to a subthreshold (S)SDS and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and open field. Inhibition of VP Npas1+ neurons enhanced resilience to chronic (C)SDS and CWDS. We identified VP Npas1+ projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial and lateral habenula (LHb), lateral hypothalamus (LH), thalamus, medial and lateral septum, and periaqueductal gray area. VP Npas1+ neurons displayed distinct transcriptomes representing distinct biological processes. Conclusions: Activity, of VP Npas1+ neurons, modulates susceptibility to social stressors and anxiety-like behavior. These outcomes could be related to their projections to brain regions that modulate reward and aversion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social experience dependent plasticity of mouse song selectivity without that of song components</a></h4>

              
                Syllable sequences in male mouse ultrasonic-vocalizations (USVs), songs, contain structure - quantified through predictability, like birdsong and aspects of speech. Apparent USV innateness and lack of learnability, discount mouse USVs for modelling speech-like social communication and its deficits. Informative contextual natural sequences (SN) were theoretically extracted and they were preferred by female mice. Primary auditory cortex (A1) supragranular neurons show differential selectivity to the same syllables in SN and random sequences (SR). Excitatory neurons (EXNs) in females showed increases in selectivity to whole SNs over SRs based on extent of social exposure with male, but syllable selectivity remained unchanged. Thus mouse A1 single neurons adaptively represent entire order of acoustic units without altering selectivity of individual units, fundamental to speech perception. Additionally, observed plasticity was replicated with silencing of somatostatin positive neurons, which had plastic effects opposite to EXNs, thus pointing out possible pathways involved in perception of sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Left angular gyrus disconnection impairs multiplication fact retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Arithmetic fact retrieval has been suggested to recruit a left-lateralized network comprising perisylvian language areas, parietal areas such as the angular gyrus (AG), and subcortical structures such as the hippocampus. However, the underlying white matter connectivity of these areas has not been evaluated systematically so far. Using simple multiplication problems, we evaluated how disconnections in parietal brain areas affected arithmetic fact retrieval following stroke. We derived disconnectivity measures by jointly considering data from n=73 patients with acute unilateral lesions in either hemisphere and a white-matter tractography atlas (HCP-842) using the Lesion Quantification Toolbox (LQT). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis indicated a left-hemispheric cluster of white matter fibers connecting the AG and superior temporal areas to be associated with a fact retrieval deficit. Subsequent analyses of direct grey-to-grey matter disconnections revealed that disconnections of additional left-hemispheric areas (e.g., between the superior temporal gyrus and parietal areas) were significantly associated with the observed fact retrieval deficit. Results imply that disconnections of parietal areas (i.e., the AG) with language-related areas (i.e., superior and middle temporal gyri) seem specifically detrimental to arithmetic fact retrieval. This suggests that arithmetic fact retrieval recruits a widespread left-hemispheric network and emphasizes the relevance of white matter connectivity for number processing.

	<p>Brain dopamine signaling is essential for the motivation to eat, and obesity is associated with altered dopaminergic signaling and increased food craving. We used molecular neuroimaging to explore whether striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability is associated with craving as measured with the General Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (G-FCQ-T). We here show that humans with obesity (n = 34) experienced significantly more craving for food compared with lean subjects (n = 32), but food craving did not correlate significantly with striatal DAT availability as assessed with 123I-FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography. We conclude that food craving is increased in obesity, but the scores for food craving are not related to changes in striatal DAT availability.</p>

	<p>The interrelation between motor and emotional processes has been a recurrent question since several decades in the scientific literature. An interesting experimental technique to explore this question is posturography which assess the modulation of human postural control. In an emerging scientific field, this technique has been used to explore the reaction of the body in different emotional conditions. However, among available studies, some inconsistencies appear. In this brief report, we want to show how a widely used experimental model, i.e., empathy for pain, allowed in several study to provide comprehensive understanding elements on the postural correlates of socioemotional information processing. In particular, the role of mental simulation is discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Heterogeneity Shapes Patterns of Spiral Ganglion Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural response properties that typify primary sensory afferents are critical to fully appreciate because they establish and, ultimately represent, the fundamental coding design used for higher-level processing. Studies illuminating the center-surround receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells, for example, were ground-breaking because they determined the foundation of visual form detection. For the auditory system, a basic organizing principle of the spiral ganglion afferents is their extensive electrophysiological heterogeneity establishing diverse intrinsic firing properties in neurons throughout the spiral ganglion. Moreover, these neurons display an impressively large array of neurotransmitter receptor types that are responsive to efferent feedback. Thus, electrophysiological diversity and its neuromodulation are a fundamental encoding mechanism contributed by the primary afferents in the auditory system. To place these features into context, we evaluated the effects of hyperpolarization and cAMP on threshold level as indicators of overall afferent responsiveness in CBA/CaJ mice of either sex. Hyperpolarization modified threshold gradients such that distinct voltage protocols could shift the relationship between sensitivity and stimulus input to reshape resolution. This resulted in an "accordion effect" that appeared to stretch, compress, or maintain responsivity across the gradient of afferent thresholds. cAMP targeted threshold and kinetic shifts to rapidly adapting neurons, thus revealing multiple cochleotopic properties that could potentially be independently regulated. These examples of dynamic heterogeneity in primary auditory afferents not only have the capacity to shift the range, sensitivity, and resolution, but to do so in a coordinated manner that appears to orchestrate changes with a seemingly unlimited repertoire.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How do we discriminate the more nuanced qualities of the sound around us? Beyond the basics of pitch and loudness, aspects, such as pattern, distance, velocity, and location, are all attributes that must be used to encode acoustic sensations effectively. While higher-level processing is required for perception, it would not be unexpected if the primary auditory afferents optimized receptor input to expedite neural encoding. The findings reported herein are consistent with this design. Neuromodulation compressed, expanded, shifted, or realigned intrinsic electrophysiological heterogeneity to alter neuronal responses selectively and dynamically. This suggests that diverse spiral ganglion phenotypes provide a rich substrate to support an almost limitless array of coding strategies within the first neural element of the auditory pathway.</p>

                <p>Cortical parvalbumin-expressing (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) neurons provide robust inhibition to neighboring pyramidal neurons, crucial for the proper functioning of cortical networks. This class of inhibitory neurons undergoes extensive synaptic formation and maturation during the first weeks after birth and continue to dynamically maintain their synaptic output throughout adulthood. While several transcription factors, such as Nkx2-1, Lhx6, and Sox6, are known to be necessary for the differentiation of progenitors into Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons, which transcriptional programs underlie the postnatal maturation and maintenance of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons' innervation and synaptic function remains largely unknown. Because Sox6 is continuously expressed in Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons until adulthood, we used conditional knock-out strategies to investigate its putative role in the postnatal maturation and synaptic function of cortical Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons in mice of both sexes. We found that early postnatal loss of Sox6 in Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons leads to failure of synaptic bouton growth, whereas later removal in mature Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons in the adult causes shrinkage of already established synaptic boutons. Paired recordings between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons and pyramidal neurons revealed reduced release probability and increased failure rate of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons' synaptic output. Furthermore, Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons lacking Sox6 display reduced expression of full-length tropomyosin-receptor kinase B (TrkB), a key modulator of GABAergic transmission. Once re-expressed in neurons lacking Sox6, TrkB was sufficient to rescue the morphologic synaptic phenotype. Finally, we showed that Sox6 mRNA levels were increased by motor training. Our data thus suggest a constitutive role for Sox6 in the maintenance of synaptic output from Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons into adulthood.</p>

These inhibitory neurons undergo extensive synaptic formation and maturation during the first weeks after birth and continue to dynamically maintain their synaptic output throughout adulthood. However, it remains largely unknown which transcriptional programs underlie the postnatal maturation and maintenance of Pvalb<sup>+</sup> neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">STK25 and MST3 Have Overlapping Roles to Regulate Rho GTPases during Cortical Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Precise control of neuronal migration is required for the laminar organization of the neocortex and critical for brain function. We previously reported that the acute disruption of the <I>Stk25</I> gene (<I>Stk25</I> conditional knock-out; cKO) during mouse embryogenesis causes anomalous neuronal migration in the neocortex, but paradoxically the <I>Stk25</I> cKO did not have a cortical phenotype, suggesting some forms of compensation exist. In this study, we report that MST3, another member of the GCKIII subgroup of the Ste20-like kinase family, compensates for loss of <I>Stk25</I> and vice versa with sex independent manner. MST3 overexpression rescued neuronal migration deficit and abnormal axonogenesis in <I>Stk25</I> cKO brains. Mechanistically, STK25 leads to Rac1 activation and reduced RhoA levels in the developing brain, both of which are required to fully restore neuronal migration in the <I>Stk25</I> cKO brain. Abnormal migration phenotypes are also rescued by overexpression of Bacurd1and Cul3, which target RhoA for degradation, and activate Rac1. This study reveals that MST3 upregulation is capable of rescuing acute <I>Stk25</I> deficiency and resolves details of signaling downstream STK25 required for corticogenesis both common to and distinct from MST3 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Proper neuronal migration during cortical development is required for normal neuronal function. Here, we show that STK25 and MST3 kinases regulate neuronal migration and polarization in a mutually compensatory manner. Furthermore, STK25 balances Rac1 activity and RhoA level through forming complexes with &alpha;-PIX and &beta;-PIX, GTPase regulatory enzymes, and Cullin3-Bacurd1/Kctd13, a pair of RhoA ubiquitination molecules in a kinase activity-independent manner. Our findings demonstrate the importance of overlapping and unique roles of STK25 and MST3 to regulate Rho GTPase activities in cortical development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tonotopic Specializations in Number, Size, and Reversal Potential of GABAergic Inputs Fine-Tune Temporal Coding at Avian Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic inhibition in neurons plays a critical role in determining the output of neural circuits. Neurons in avian nucleus magnocellularis (NM) use several tonotopic-region-dependent specializations to relay the timing information of sound in the auditory nerve to higher auditory nuclei. Previously, we showed that feedforward GABAergic inhibition in NM has a different dependence on the level of auditory nerve activity, with the low-frequency region having a low-threshold and linear relationship, while the high-frequency region has a high-threshold and step-like relationship. However, it remains unclear how the GABAergic synapses are tonotopically regulated and interact with other specializations of NM neurons. In this study, we examined GABAergic transmission in the NM of chickens of both sexes and explored its contributions to the temporal coding of sound at each tonotopic region. We found that the number and size of unitary GABAergic currents and their reversal potential were finely tuned at each tonotopic region in the NM. At the lower-frequency region, unitary GABAergic currents were larger in number but smaller in size. In addition, their reversal potential was close to the resting potential of neurons, which enabled reliable inhibition despite the smaller potassium conductance. At the higher-frequency region, on the other hand, unitary GABAergic currents were fewer, larger, and highly depolarizing, which enabled powerful inhibition via activating the large potassium conductance. Thus, we propose that GABAergic synapses are coordinated with the characteristics of excitatory synapses and postsynaptic neurons, ensuring the temporal coding for wide frequency and intensity ranges.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found in avian cochlear nucleus that the number and size of unitary GABAergic inputs differed among tonotopic regions and correlated to respective excitatory inputs; it was larger in number but smaller in size for neurons tuned to lower-frequency sound. Furthermore, GABAergic reversal potential also differed among the regions in accordance with the size of Kv1 current; it was less depolarized in the lower-frequency neurons with smaller Kv1 current. These differentiations of GABAergic transmission maximized the effects of inhibition at each tonotopic region, ensuring precise and reliable temporal coding across frequencies and intensities. Our results emphasize the importance of optimizing characteristics of GABAergic transmission within individual neurons for proper neural circuit function.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have shown that self-generated stimuli in auditory, visual, and somatosensory domains are attenuated, producing decreased behavioral and neural responses compared with the same stimuli that are externally generated. Yet, whether such attenuation also occurs for higher-level cognitive functions beyond sensorimotor processing remains unknown. In this study, we assessed whether cognitive functions such as numerosity estimations are subject to attenuation in 56 healthy participants (32 women). We designed a task allowing the controlled comparison of numerosity estimations for self-generated (active condition) and externally generated (passive condition) words. Our behavioral results showed a larger underestimation of self-generated compared with externally generated words, suggesting that numerosity estimations for self-generated words are attenuated. Moreover, the linear relationship between the reported and actual number of words was stronger for self-generated words, although the ability to track errors about numerosity estimations was similar across conditions. Neuroimaging results revealed that numerosity underestimation involved increased functional connectivity between the right intraparietal sulcus and an extended network (bilateral supplementary motor area, left inferior parietal lobule, and left superior temporal gyrus) when estimating the number of self-generated versus externally generated words. We interpret our results in light of two models of attenuation and discuss their perceptual versus cognitive origins.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We perceive sensory events as less intense when they are self-generated compared with when they are externally generated. This phenomenon, called attenuation, enables us to distinguish sensory events from self and external origins. Here, we designed a novel fMRI paradigm to assess whether cognitive processes such as numerosity estimations are also subject to attenuation. When asking participants to estimate the number of words they had generated or passively heard, we found bigger underestimation in the former case, providing behavioral evidence of attenuation. Attenuation was associated with increased functional connectivity of the intraparietal sulcus, a region involved in numerosity processing. Together, our results indicate that the attenuation of self-generated stimuli is not limited to sensory consequences but is also impact cognitive processes such as numerosity estimations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Trial-to-Trial Variability of Spiking Delay Activity in Prefrontal Cortex Constrains Burst-Coding Models of Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>A hallmark neuronal correlate of working memory (WM) is stimulus-selective spiking activity of neurons in PFC during mnemonic delays. These observations have motivated an influential computational modeling framework in which WM is supported by persistent activity. Recently, this framework has been challenged by arguments that observed persistent activity may be an artifact of trial-averaging, which potentially masks high variability of delay activity at the single-trial level. In an alternative scenario, WM delay activity could be encoded in bursts of selective neuronal firing which occur intermittently across trials. However, this alternative proposal has not been tested on single-neuron spike-train data. Here, we developed a framework for addressing this issue by characterizing the trial-to-trial variability of neuronal spiking quantified by Fano factor (FF). By building a doubly stochastic Poisson spiking model, we first demonstrated that the burst-coding proposal implies a significant increase in FF positively correlated with firing rate, and thus loss of stability across trials during the delay. Simulation of spiking cortical circuit WM models further confirmed that FF is a sensitive measure that can well dissociate distinct WM mechanisms. We then tested these predictions on datasets of single-neuron recordings from macaque PFC during three WM tasks. In sharp contrast to the burst-coding model predictions, we only found a small fraction of neurons showing increased WM-dependent burstiness, and stability across trials during delay was strengthened in empirical data. Therefore, reduced trial-to-trial variability during delay provides strong constraints on the contribution of single-neuron intermittent bursting to WM maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There are diverging classes of theoretical models explaining how information is maintained in working memory by cortical circuits. In an influential model class, neurons exhibit persistent elevated memorandum-selective firing, whereas a recently developed class of burst-coding models suggests that persistent activity is an artifact of trial-averaging, and spiking is sparse in each single trial, subserved by brief intermittent bursts. However, this alternative picture has not been characterized or tested on empirical spike-train data. Here we combine mathematical analysis, computational model simulation, and experimental data analysis to test empirically these two classes of models and show that the trial-to-trial variability of empirical spike trains is not consistent with burst coding. These findings provide constraints for theoretical models of working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Generalizable EEG Encoding Models with Naturalistic Audiovisual Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                <p>In natural conversations, listeners must attend to what others are saying while ignoring extraneous background sounds. Recent studies have used encoding models to predict electroencephalography (EEG) responses to speech in noise-free listening situations, sometimes referred to as "speech tracking." Researchers have analyzed how speech tracking changes with different types of background noise. It is unclear, however, whether neural responses from acoustically rich, naturalistic environments with and without background noise can be generalized to more controlled stimuli. If encoding models for acoustically rich, naturalistic stimuli are generalizable to other tasks, this could aid in data collection from populations of individuals who may not tolerate listening to more controlled and less engaging stimuli for long periods of time. We recorded noninvasive scalp EEG while 17 human participants (8 male/9 female) listened to speech without noise and audiovisual speech stimuli containing overlapping speakers and background sounds. We fit multivariate temporal receptive field encoding models to predict EEG responses to pitch, the acoustic envelope, phonological features, and visual cues in both stimulus conditions. Our results suggested that neural responses to naturalistic stimuli were generalizable to more controlled datasets. EEG responses to speech in isolation were predicted accurately using phonological features alone, while responses to speech in a rich acoustic background were more accurate when including both phonological and acoustic features. Our findings suggest that naturalistic audiovisual stimuli can be used to measure receptive fields that are comparable and generalizable to more controlled audio-only stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding spoken language in natural environments requires listeners to parse acoustic and linguistic information in the presence of other distracting stimuli. However, most studies of auditory processing rely on highly controlled stimuli with no background noise, or with background noise inserted at specific times. Here, we compare models where EEG data are predicted based on a combination of acoustic, phonetic, and visual features in highly disparate stimuli&mdash;sentences from a speech corpus and speech embedded within movie trailers. We show that modeling neural responses to highly noisy, audiovisual movies can uncover tuning for acoustic and phonetic information that generalizes to simpler stimuli typically used in sensory neuroscience experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Neurocomputational Model for Intrinsic Reward</a></h4>

              
                <p>Standard economic indicators provide an incomplete picture of what we value both as individuals and as a society. Furthermore, canonical macroeconomic measures, such as GDP, do not account for non-market activities (e.g., cooking, childcare) that nevertheless impact well-being. Here, we introduce a computational tool that measures the affective value of experiences (e.g., playing a musical instrument without errors). We go on to validate this tool with neural data, using fMRI to measure neural activity in male and female human subjects performing a reinforcement learning task that incorporated periodic ratings of subjective affective state. Learning performance determined level of payment (i.e., extrinsic reward). Crucially, the task also incorporated a skilled performance component (i.e., intrinsic reward) which did not influence payment. Both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influenced affective dynamics, and their relative influence could be captured in our computational model. Individuals for whom intrinsic rewards had a greater influence on affective state than extrinsic rewards had greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity for intrinsic than extrinsic rewards. Thus, we show that computational modeling of affective dynamics can index the subjective value of intrinsic relative to extrinsic rewards, a "computational hedonometer" that reflects both behavior and neural activity that quantifies the affective value of experience.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traditional economic indicators are increasingly recognized to provide an incomplete picture of what we value as a society. Standard economic approaches struggle to accurately assign values to non-market activities that nevertheless may be intrinsically rewarding, prompting a need for new tools to measure what really matters to individuals. Using a combination of neuroimaging and computational modeling, we show that despite their lack of instrumental value, intrinsic rewards influence subjective affective state and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity. The relative degree to which extrinsic and intrinsic rewards influence affective state is predictive of their relative impacts on neural activity, confirming the utility of our approach for measuring the affective value of experiences and other non-market activities in individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cognitive and Neural State Dynamics of Narrative Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                <p>Narrative comprehension involves a constant interplay of the accumulation of incoming events and their integration into a coherent structure. This study characterizes cognitive states during narrative comprehension and the network-level reconfiguration occurring dynamically in the functional brain. We presented movie clips of temporally scrambled sequences to human participants (male and female), eliciting fluctuations in the subjective feeling of comprehension. Comprehension occurred when processing events that were highly causally related to the previous events, suggesting that comprehension entails the integration of narratives into a causally coherent structure. The functional neuroimaging results demonstrated that the integrated and efficient brain state emerged during the moments of narrative integration with the increased level of activation and across-modular connections in the default mode network. Underlying brain states were synchronized across individuals when comprehending novel narratives, with increased occurrences of the default mode network state, integrated with sensory processing network, during narrative integration. A model based on time-resolved functional brain connectivity predicted changing cognitive states related to comprehension that are general across narratives. Together, these results support adaptive reconfiguration and interaction of the functional brain networks on causal integration of the narratives.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain can integrate temporally disconnected pieces of information into coherent narratives. However, the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of how the brain builds a narrative representation remain largely unknown. We showed that comprehension occurs as the causally related events are integrated to form a coherent situational model. Using fMRI, we revealed that the large-scale brain states and interaction between brain regions dynamically reconfigure as comprehension evolves, with the default mode network playing a central role during moments of narrative integration. Overall, the study demonstrates that narrative comprehension occurs through a dynamic process of information accumulation and causal integration, supported by the time-varying reconfiguration and brain network interaction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanisms Underlying the Selective Therapeutic Efficacy of Carbamazepine for Attenuation of Trigeminal Nerve Injury Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Different peripheral nerve injuries cause neuropathic pain through distinct mechanisms. Even the site of injury may impact underlying mechanisms, as indicated by the clinical finding that the antiseizure drug carbamazepine (CBZ) relieves pain because of compression injuries of trigeminal but not somatic nerves. We leveraged this observation in the present study hypothesizing that because CBZ blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), its therapeutic selectivity reflects differences between trigeminal and somatic nerves with respect to injury-induced changes in VGSCs. CBZ diminished ongoing and evoked pain behavior in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the infraorbital nerve (ION) but had minimal effect in rats with sciatic nerve CCI. This difference in behavior was associated with a selective increase in the potency of CBZ-induced inhibition of compound action potentials in the ION, an effect mirrored in human trigeminal versus somatic nerves. The increase in potency was associated with a selective increase in the efficacy of the Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 channel blocker ICA-121431 and Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 protein in the ION, but no change in Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 mRNA in trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, local ICA-121431 administration reversed ION CCI-induced hypersensitivity. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study is based on evidence of differences in pain and its treatment depending on whether the pain is above (trigeminal) or below (somatic) the neck, as well as evidence that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) may contribute to these differences. The focus of the present study was on channels underlying action potential propagation in peripheral nerves. There were differences between somatic and trigeminal nerves in VGSC subtypes underlying action potential propagation both in the absence and presence of injury. Importantly, because the local block of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 in the trigeminal nerve reverses nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, the selective upregulation of Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.1 in trigeminal nerves suggests a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Addiction-Associated Genetic Variants Implicate Brain Cell Type- and Region-Specific Cis-Regulatory Elements in Addiction Neurobiology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent large genome-wide association studies have identified multiple confident risk loci linked to addiction-associated behavioral traits. Most genetic variants linked to addiction-associated traits lie in noncoding regions of the genome, likely disrupting <I>cis</I>-regulatory element (CRE) function. CREs tend to be highly cell type-specific and may contribute to the functional development of the neural circuits underlying addiction. Yet, a systematic approach for predicting the impact of risk variants on the CREs of specific cell populations is lacking. To dissect the cell types and brain regions underlying addiction-associated traits, we applied stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to compare genome-wide association studies to genomic regions collected from human and mouse assays for open chromatin, which is associated with CRE activity. We found enrichment of addiction-associated variants in putative CREs marked by open chromatin in neuronal (NeuN<sup>+</sup>) nuclei collected from multiple prefrontal cortical areas and striatal regions known to play major roles in reward and addiction. To further dissect the cell type-specific basis of addiction-associated traits, we also identified enrichments in human orthologs of open chromatin regions of female and male mouse neuronal subtypes: cortical excitatory, D1, D2, and PV. Last, we developed machine learning models to predict mouse cell type-specific open chromatin, enabling us to further categorize human NeuN<sup>+</sup> open chromatin regions into cortical excitatory or striatal D1 and D2 neurons and predict the functional impact of addiction-associated genetic variants. Our results suggest that different neuronal subtypes within the reward system play distinct roles in the variety of traits that contribute to addiction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We combine statistical genetic and machine learning techniques to find that the predisposition to for nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis use behaviors can be partially explained by genetic variants in conserved regulatory elements within specific brain regions and neuronal subtypes of the reward system. Our computational framework can flexibly integrate open chromatin data across species to screen for putative causal variants in a cell type- and tissue-specific manner for numerous complex traits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CDKL5 Deficiency Augments Inhibitory Input into the Dentate Gyrus That Can Be Reversed by Deep Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic behaviors. Although loss of CDKL5 affects a number of molecular pathways, very little has been discovered about the physiological effects of these changes on the neural circuitry. We therefore studied synaptic plasticity and local circuit activity in the dentate gyrus of both <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>&ndash;/<I>y</I></sup> and <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mutant mice. We found that CDKL5 haploinsufficiency in both male and female mice impairs hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in multiple tasks. <I>In vivo</I>, loss of CDKL5 reduced LTP of the perforant path to the dentate gyrus and augmented feedforward inhibition in this pathway; <I>ex vivo</I> experiments confirmed that excitatory/inhibitory input into the dentate gyrus is skewed toward inhibition. Injecting the GABAergic antagonist gabazine into the dentate improved contextual fear memory in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>&ndash;/<I>y</I></sup> mice. Finally, chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 is important for maintaining proper dentate excitatory/inhibitory balance, with consequences for hippocampal memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive impairment is a core feature of cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder. Although CDKL5 deficiency has been found to affect a number of molecular pathways, little is known about its physiological effects on the neural circuitry. We find that CDKL5 loss reduces hippocampal synaptic plasticity and augments feedforward inhibition in the perforant path to the dentate gyrus <I>in vivo</I> in <I>Cdkl5</I> mutant mice. Chronic forniceal deep brain stimulation rescued hippocampal memory deficits, restored synaptic plasticity, and relieved feedforward inhibition in <I>Cdkl5</I><sup>+/&ndash;</sup> mice, as it had previously done with Rett syndrome mice, suggesting that such stimulation may be useful for other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Slo2/KNa Channels in Drosophila Protect against Spontaneous and Induced Seizure-like Behavior Associated with an Increased Persistent Na+ Current</a></h4>

              
                <p>Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity is a unique feature of Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (K<SUB>Na</SUB>) channels, making them naturally suited to counter a sudden influx in Na<sup>+</sup> ions. As such, it has long been suggested that K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels may serve a protective function against excessive excitation associated with neuronal injury and disease. This hypothesis, however, has remained largely untested. Here, we examine K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels encoded by the <I>Drosophila Slo2</I> (<I>dSlo2</I>) gene in males and females. We show that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels are selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons in the adult brain, as well as in glutamatergic motor neurons, where dampening excitation may function to inhibit global hyperactivity and seizure-like behavior. Indeed, we show that effects of feeding <I>Drosophila</I> a cholinergic agonist are exacerbated by the loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels. Similar to mammalian Slo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels, we show that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels encode a TTX-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> conductance, indicating that dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels can be activated by Na<sup>+</sup> carried by voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels. We then tested the role of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels in established genetic seizure models in which the voltage-dependent persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<SUB>Nap</SUB>) is elevated. We show that the absence of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels increased susceptibility to mechanically induced seizure-like behavior. Similar results were observed in WT flies treated with veratridine, an enhancer of I<SUB>Nap</SUB>. Finally, we show that loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels in both genetic and pharmacologically primed seizure models resulted in the appearance of spontaneous seizures. Together, our results support a model in which dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels, activated by neuronal overexcitation, contribute to a protective threshold to suppress the induction of seizure-like activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Slo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels are unique in that they constitute a repolarizing K<sup>+</sup> pore that is activated by the depolarizing Na<sup>+</sup> ion, making them naturally suited to function as a protective "brake" against overexcitation and Na<sup>+</sup> overload. Here, we test this hypothesis <I>in vivo</I> by examining how a null mutation of the <I>Drosophila Slo2</I> (<I>dSlo2</I>)/<I>K<SUB>Na</SUB></I> gene affects seizure-like behavior in genetic and pharmacological models of epilepsy. We show that indeed the loss of dSlo2/K<SUB>Na</SUB> channels results in increased incidence and severity of induced seizure behavior, as well as the appearance of spontaneous seizure activity. Our results advance our understanding of neuronal excitability and protective mechanisms that preserve normal physiology and the suppression of seizure susceptibility.</p>

                Background: Natural products with antibacterial potential have begun to be tested on biofilm models, bringing us closer to understanding the response generated by the complex microbial ecosystems of the oral cavity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities and chemical compositions of Peruvian propolis in an in vitro biofilm of Streptococcus gordonii and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Methods: The experimental work involved a consecutive, in vitro, longitudinal, and double-blinded study design. Propolis samples were collected from 13 different regions of the Peruvian Andes. The disk diffusion method was used for the antimicrobial susceptibility test. The cytotoxic effect of propolis on human gingival fibroblasts was determined by cell viability method using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the effect of propolis on the biofilm was evaluated by confocal microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The 0.78 mg/mL and 1.563 mg/mL concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the chloroform residue of Oxapampa propolis showed effects on biofilm thickness and the copy numbers of the srtA gene of S. gordonii and the radD gene of F. nucleatum at 48 and 120 hours, and chromatography (UV, λ 280 nm) identified rhamnocitrin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, kaempferol, diosmetin, acacetin, glycerol, and chrysoeriol. Conclusions: Of the 13 propolis evaluated, it was found that only the methanolic fraction of Oxapampa propolis showed antibacterial and antibiofilm effects without causing damage to human gingival fibroblasts. Likewise, when evaluating the chemical composition of this fraction, eight flavonoids were identified.

                Background: Orofacial myofunctional therapy (OMT), for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is emerging with recognition of specific phenotypes. Since many OSA sufferers are already familiar with positive airway pressure machines, we designed an OMT protocol involving the modification of such a machine to deliver negative airway pressure.  We hypothesized that a three-month trial of using this protocol while awake would reduce the signs and symptoms of OSA. Methods: Fifteen adults with OSA enrolled for 30-minute sessions/three days a week for a three-month trial of “upper airway muscle physical therapy” while awake. Overnight sleep studies were performed before and after the intervention to determine each subject’s apnea hypopnea index (AHI), the primary outcome measure. Negative airway pressure application was determined by estimation of each subject’s one-repetition maximum (an exercise physiology measure of strength capacity). Exercise sessions consisted of subjects breathing against this pressure for a series of repetitions, and sets. Results: While the mean post study AHI was slightly improved (-4.3 ± 12.0 [ -10.9, 2.3], mean ± standard deviation, 95% confidence interval), it was not statistically significant.  The results were similar when the AHI was divided by the sleep state (REM vs. non-REM).  The nadir saturation was also essentially unchanged. The eight subjects with mild or moderate OSA (AHI < 30) showed similar results. Conclusions: Though there was no significant reduction in AHI in this small cohort, the methods elucidate a new daytime use for a machine with which many OSA sufferers are familiar.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Evolution of Gross Forelimb and Fine Digit Kinematics during Skilled Reaching Acquisition in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to learn dexterous motor skills is a fundamental aspect of human behavior. However, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms for dexterous skill learning are unclear. Advancing our understanding of motor skill learning requires the integration of modern neuroscientific techniques with a rigorously characterized dexterous task. The development of automated rodent skilled reaching with paw tracking allows detailed analysis of how reach-to-grasp kinematics evolve during learning. We assessed how both "gross" forelimb and "fine" digit kinematics changed as rats learned skilled reaching. Rats whose success rates increased (learners) consistently reduced the variability in their reach trajectories. Refinement of fine digit control generally continued after consistency in gross hand transport to the pellet plateaued. Interestingly, most rats whose success rates did not increase (non-learners) also converged on consistent reach kinematics. Some non-learners, however, maintained substantial variability in hand and digit trajectories throughout training. These results suggest that gross and fine motor components of dexterous skill are, on average, learned over different timescales. Nonetheless, there is significant intersubject variability in learning rates as assessed by both reaching success and consistency of reach kinematics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Individual Differences in Frustrative Nonreward Behavior for Sucrose in Rats Predict Motivation for Fentanyl under Progressive Ratio</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Frustrative nonreward (FN) is a construct in the Negative Valence Systems domain of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) from the National Institute of Mental Health. An organism&rsquo;s response to frustrating situations (e.g., inability to obtain an expected reward) has broad implications for a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders. The current project developed a first of its kind rat operant behavioral model of FN based loosely on the human Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). The current study shows that individual differences in FN for sucrose pellets are consistent across sessions at baseline and that the task is sensitive to reward size in male rats. More importantly, high FN behavior for sucrose predicts early "breaking" for intravenous fentanyl self-administration under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. These results solidify frustration/ FN as an important factor for substance use disorders in addition to craving, impulsivity, and habit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical use of antiviral, antibiotic and immunomodulatory drugs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study in Bandung, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Evidence of highly effective repurposed drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is insufficient. However, empirical therapy using antiviral, antibiotic and immunomodulatory drugs is massive. Studies evaluating the clinical use of these drugs in Indonesia are sparse. Methods: We performed a retrospective study using medical records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from July 2020 to March 2021 in Bandung, Indonesia. Data were collected at relevant timelines: age, sex, comorbid condition, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and hematology at admission; antiviral, antibiotic, and immunomodulator treatment during hospitalization; length of stay hospitalization (LOS) and death at discharge. Clinical use of the drug regimens included dose, frequency, and duration of therapy. The main outcome of hospitalization care was LOS and death. Results: Out of 249 patients, 43.3% had a comorbid condition, 74.7% had non-severe COVID-19 (SpO2 ≥ 90%), and almost all received antiviral or antibiotic agents. Remdesivir was the most frequent drug composing various antiviral regimens. Patients receiving a combination of remdesivir and favipiravir had lower SpO2 compared to those receiving oseltamivir (p=0.01). The short LOS was associated with remdesivir alone (p=0.03), the combination of favipiravir and oseltamivir (p=0.01), and the combination of intravenous levofloxacin and ceftriaxone (p<0.0001). Immunomodulatory drugs (methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, tocilizumab) were used in 47.1% of patients with low SpO2 (p=0.001). Its use was associated with prolonged LOS (p=0.0043). The increased risk of death in patients treated with the combination of remdesivir and favipiravir (OR 4.1;95%CI 1.4-12.2), and immunomodulatory drugs (OR 6.2; 95%CI 1.7-23.3) was confounded by the baseline characteristics of older age, comorbid condition, SpO2 level, and low lymphocyte number. Conclusions: Some treatment regimens were associated with short LOS, but there were drug regimens which might increase the risk of death. Further study should control the clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients at admission to confirm the outcome of death following drug therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The network structure affects the fixation probability when it couples to the birth-death dynamics in finite population</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Ali Dehghani, Amir Hossein Darooneh, Mohammad Kohandel</p>

The study of evolutionary dynamics on graphs is an interesting topic for researchers in various fields of science and mathematics. In systems with finite population, different model dynamics are distinguished by their effects on two important quantities: fixation probability and fixation time. The isothermal theorem declares that the fixation probability is the same for a wide range of graphs and it only depends on the population size. This has also been proved for more complex graphs that are called complex networks. In this work, we propose a model that couples the population dynamics to the network structure and show that in this case, the isothermal theorem is being violated. In our model the death rate of a mutant depends on its number of neighbors, and neutral drift holds only in the average. We investigate the fixation probability behavior in terms of the complexity parameter, such as the scale-free exponent for the scale-free network and the rewiring probability for the small-world network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Determining travel fluxes in epidemic areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daipeng Chen, Yuyi Xue, Yanni Xiao</p>

Infectious diseases attack humans from time to time and threaten the lives and survival of people all around the world. An important strategy to prevent the spatial spread of infectious diseases is to restrict population travel. With the reduction of the epidemic situation, when and where travel restrictions can be lifted, and how to organize orderly movement patterns become critical and fall within the scope of this study. We define a novel diffusion distance derived from the estimated mobility network, based on which we provide a general model to describe the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases with a random diffusion process and a deterministic drift process of the population. We consequently develop a multi-source data fusion method to determine the population flow in epidemic areas. In this method, we first select available subregions in epidemic areas, and then provide solutions to initiate new travel flux among these subregions. To verify our model and method, we analyze the multi-source data from mainland China and obtain a new travel flux triggering scheme in the selected 29 cities with the most active population movements in mainland China. The testable predictions in these selected cities show that reopening the borders in accordance with our proposed travel flux will not cause a second outbreak of COVID-19 in these cities. The finding provides a methodology of re-triggering travel flux during the weakening spread stage of the epidemic.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial heterogeneity enhance robustness of large multi-species ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Susanne Pettersson, Martin Nilsson Jacobi</p>

Understanding ecosystem stability and functioning is a long-standing goal in theoretical ecology, with one of the main tools being dynamical modelling of species abundances. With the help of spatially unresolved (well-mixed) population models and equilibrium dynamics, limits to stability and regions of various ecosystem robustness have been extensively mapped in terms of diversity (number of species), types of interactions, interaction strengths, varying interaction networks (for example plant-pollinator, food-web) and varying structures of these networks. Although many insights have been gained, the impact of spatial extension is not included in this body of knowledge. Recent studies of spatially explicit modelling on the other hand have shown that stability limits can be crossed and diversity increased for systems with spatial heterogeneity in species interactions and/or chaotic dynamics. Here we show that such crossing and diversity increase can appear under less strict conditions. We find that the mere possibility of varying species abundances at different spatial locations make possible the preservation or increase in diversity across previous boundaries thought to mark catastrophic transitions. In addition, we introduce and make explicit a multitude of different dynamics a spatially extended complex system can use to stabilise. This expanded stabilising repertoire of dynamics is largest at intermediate levels of dispersal. Thus we find that spatially extended systems with intermediate dispersal are more robust, in general have higher diversity and can stabilise beyond previous stability boundaries, in contrast to well-mixed systems.

                <p>by Frank O. Aylward, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, Anh D. Ha, Eugene V. Koonin</p>

Large DNA viruses of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota have recently emerged as important members of ecosystems around the globe that challenge traditional views of viral complexity. Numerous members of this phylum that cannot be classified within established families have recently been reported, and there is presently a strong need for a robust phylogenomic and taxonomic framework for these viruses. Here, we report a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of the Nucleocytoviricota, present a set of giant virus orthologous groups (GVOGs) together with a benchmarked reference phylogeny, and delineate a hierarchical taxonomy within this phylum. We show that the majority of Nucleocytoviricota diversity can be partitioned into 6 orders, 32 families, and 344 genera, substantially expanding the number of currently recognized taxonomic ranks for these viruses. We integrate our results within a taxonomy that has been adopted for all viruses to establish a unifying framework for the study of Nucleocytoviricota diversity, evolution, and environmental distribution.

                Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020. Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and Pearson’s correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC) in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March – July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44% respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the data access control using blockchain for healthcare domain [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods: In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results: We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion: This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

                Background: This study aimed to determine whether people living in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia would prefer to continue the practice of physical distancing after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or to return to their previous way of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to October 2020 in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent electronically through social media. Data on participants’ demographics and their perspectives regarding post-pandemic physical distancing were collected. The calculated sample size was 1,066; however, the total number of responses included in the analysis was 989. Results: The average age of the participants was 31.15±11.93 years. There were 435 men and 554 women in the study. Participants showed significantly high levels of disagreement with statements indicating that they were willing to use public transportation (61%), attend social gatherings (36%), and hug relatives or colleagues (40%) after the pandemic (p<0.001); however, 43% agreed that they would spend time with family or friends (p<0.001). The level of education was also found to be significantly related to the responses, and the level of disagreement increased as the level of education increased (p<0.001). Conclusions: One-third of the study participants planned to continue engaging in physical distancing even after the current pandemic. This clearly indicates that our lives are not returning to how they were before the pandemic. However, it cannot be concluded whether or not this behavior will prevail in the long run. If so, it may greatly affect some businesses and perhaps some social norms and values as well.

                Background: The sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) is a freshwater fish from the Loricariidae family, and is considered an invasive species in Indonesia. The fish is usually neglected and discarded. Its protein hydrolysate is the product of the breakdown of proteins into amino acids through the hydrolysis of acids, bases, or enzymes. Therefore, this study aims to determine the hydrolysate characteristics of sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) proteins, produced with different pH and hydrolysis durations. Methods: The hydrolysis was carried out with variable pH (control, 5, 7, 9) and hydrolysis durations (12 and 24 hours) in three replicates. Results: The hydrolysis duration, pH, and interaction of both variables had significant effects (p<0.05) on the parameters of yield, antioxidant activity, degree of hydrolysis, protein levels, and ash content. Similarly, the moisture content, hydrolysis duration, and pH were significantly affected (p<0.05), while their interactions were not (p>0.05). The pH treatment had a significant effect on fat content (p<0.05), while the hydrolysis length and the interaction between the two had no significant effect (p>0.05). Based on this study, the best resulting production of fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) from sailfin catfish were a for a combination of pH 9 and a hydrolysis duration of 24 hours. The characteristics of FPH produced were as follows: a yield of 57.39%, antioxidant activity 63.99%, degree of hydrolysis 40.67%, water content 7.28%, ash content 7.63%, fat content 5.10%, protein content 34.51%, molecular weight 6.14 -118.17 KDa, total essential amino acids 49.30%, and nonessential amino acids 50.71%. Conclusions: Two factors affected FPH characteristics in sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis). The best processing conditions to obtain optimal characteristics for FPH were a yield of 57.39%, antioxidant levels of 63.99%, a DH of 40.67%, a moisture content of 7.28%, ash content of 7.63%, fat content of 5.10%, and protein content of 34.51%.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Promise of nucleic acid therapeutics for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nucleic acid therapeutics have been attracting attention as novel drug discovery modalities for intractable diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, the results of a phase I/II study using the antisense oligonucleotides Tofersen to treat familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 mutation have been reported. Intrathecal Tofersen administration resulted in a 36% reduction in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another report described two patients with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 treated with an adeno-associated virus encoding a microRNA targeting superoxide dismutase 1. The first patient, who possessed the fast progressive mutant A5V, received a single intrathecal infusion. Although the patient died of respiratory arrest 16 months after treatment, autopsy findings showed a reduction of &gt;90% in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the spinal cord. Clinical trials on antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting other major amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causative genes, <i>Fused in sarcoma</i> and <i>chromosome 9 open reading frame 72</i>, are ongoing. To attenuate the pathology of TDP-43, strategies targeting regulators of TDP-43 (ataxin 2) and proteins downstream of TDP-43 (stathmin 2) by antisense oligonucleotides are being developed. The advent of nucleic acid therapeutics has enabled to specifically attack the molecules in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathological cascade, expanding the options for therapeutic targets.</p>

                In the cell nucleus, radial genome organization relative to the nuclear lamina exhibits both cell type–specific variability and evolutionarily conserved distribution. A recent study by Ahanger, Delgado et al. explores the in vivo spatial distribution of the genome in the brain and identifies conserved genomic localization across mammalian species that are correlated with gene expression states.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The many dimensions of human hippocampal organization and (dys)function</a></h4>

              
                The internal organization of hippocampal formation has been studied for more than a century. Although early accounts emphasized its subfields along the medial–lateral axis, findings in recent decades have highlighted also the anterior-to-posterior (i.e., longitudinal) axis as a key contributor to this brain region’s functional organization. Hence, understanding of hippocampal function likely demands characterizing both medial-to-lateral and anterior-to-posterior axes, an approach that has been concretized by recent advances in in vivo parcellation and gradient mapping techniques.

                The recognition of a spatial landmark by its sensory features poses a problem for neural circuits. Fischler-Ruiz, et al. show how this problem is solved when mice use odor cues to navigate in the dark. In the hippocampus, path integration imposes spatial meaning on odor cues, thereby creating new landmarks.

                How does the human brain encode semantic information about objects? This paper reconciles two seemingly contradictory views. The first proposes that local neural populations independently encode semantic features; the second, that semantic representations arise as a dynamic distributed code that changes radically with stimulus processing. Combining simulations with a well-known neural network model of semantic memory, multivariate pattern classification, and human electrocorticography, we find that both views are partially correct: information about the animacy of a depicted stimulus is distributed across ventral temporal cortex in a dynamic code possessing feature-like elements posteriorly but with elements that change rapidly and nonlinearly in anterior regions. This pattern is consistent with the view that anterior temporal lobes serve as a deep cross-modal ‘hub’ in an interactive semantic network, and more generally suggests that tertiary association cortices may adopt dynamic distributed codes difficult to detect with common brain imaging methods.

                B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated antigen internalization and presentation are essential for humoral memory immune responses. Antigen encountered by B-cells is often tightly associated with the surface of pathogens and/or antigen-presenting cells. Internalization of such antigens requires myosin-mediated traction forces and extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes, but the mechanism triggering lysosomal exocytosis is unknown. Here we show that BCR-mediated recognition of antigen tethered to beads, to planar lipid-bilayers or expressed on cell surfaces causes localized plasma membrane (PM) permeabilization, a process that requires BCR signaling and non-muscle myosin II activity. B-cell permeabilization triggers PM repair responses involving lysosomal exocytosis, and B-cells permeabilized by surface-associated antigen internalize more antigen than cells that remain intact. Higher affinity antigens cause more B-cell permeabilization and lysosomal exocytosis and are more efficiently presented to T-cells. Thus, PM permeabilization by surface-associated antigen triggers a lysosome-mediated B-cell resealing response, providing the extracellular hydrolases that facilitate antigen internalization and presentation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNF43 inhibits WNT5A-driven signaling and suppresses melanoma invasion and resistance to the targeted therapy</a></h4>

              
                RNF43 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and known negative regulator of WNT/β-catenin signaling. We demonstrate that RNF43 is also a regulator of noncanonical WNT5A-induced signaling in human cells. Analysis of the RNF43 interactome using BioID and immunoprecipitation showed that RNF43 can interact with the core receptor complex components dedicated to the noncanonical Wnt pathway such as ROR1, ROR2, VANGL1, and VANGL2. RNF43 triggers VANGL2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and clathrin-dependent internalization of ROR1 receptor and inhibits ROR2 activation. These activities of RNF43 are physiologically relevant and block pro-metastatic WNT5A signaling in melanoma. RNF43 inhibits responses to WNT5A, which results in the suppression of invasive properties of melanoma cells. Furthermore, RNF43 prevented WNT5A-assisted development of resistance to BRAF V600E and MEK inhibitors. Next, RNF43 acted as melanoma suppressor and improved response to targeted therapies in vivo. In line with these findings, <i>RNF43</i> expression decreases during melanoma progression and RNF43-low patients have a worse prognosis. We conclude that RNF43 is a newly discovered negative regulator of WNT5A-mediated biological responses that desensitizes cells to WNT5A.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relationship between systolic blood pressure and decision-making during emotional processing</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Emotional states are expressed in body and mind through subjective experience of physiological changes. In previous work, subliminal priming of anger prior to lexical decisions increased systolic blood pressure (SBP). This increase predicted the slowing of response times (RT), suggesting that baroreflex-related autonomic changes and their interoceptive (feedback) representations, influence cognition. Alexithymia is a subclinical affective dysfunction characterized by difficulty in identifying emotions. Atypical autonomic and interoceptive profiles are observed in alexithymia. Therefore, we sought to identify mechanisms through which SBP fluctuations during emotional processing might influence decision-making, including whether alexithymia contributes to this relationship. Methods Thirty-two male participants performed an affect priming paradigm and completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Emotional faces were briefly presented (20ms) prior a short-term memory task. RT, accuracy and SBP were recorded on a trial-by-trial basis. Generalized mixed-effects linear models were used to evaluate the impact of emotion, physiological changes, alexithymia score, and their interactions, on performances. Results A main effect of emotion was observed on accuracy. Participants were more accurate on trials with anger primes, compared to neutral priming. Greater accuracy was related to increased SBP. An interaction between SBP and emotion was observed on RT: Increased SBP was associated with RT prolongation in the anger priming condition, yet this relationship was absent under the sadness priming. Alexithymia did not significantly moderate the above relationships. Conclusions Our data suggest that peripheral autonomic responses during affective challenges guide cognitive processes. We discuss our findings in the theoretical framework proposed by Lacey and Lacey (1970).

                High-fidelity sensory neural implants must be calibrated to precisely activate specific cells via extracellular stimulation. However, collecting and analyzing the required electrical stimulation data may be difficult in the clinic. A potential solution is to infer stimulation sensitivity from intrinsic electrical properties. Here, this inference was tested using large-scale high-density stimulation and recording from macaque retinal ganglion cells ex vivo. Electrodes recording larger spikes exhibited lower activation thresholds, with distinct trends for somas and axons, and consistent trends across cells and retinas. Thresholds for somatic electrodes increased with distance from the axon initial segment. Responses were inversely related to thresholds, and exhibited a steeper dependence on injected current for axonal than somatic electrodes. Dendritic electrodes were largely ineffective for eliciting spikes. Biophysical simulations qualitatively reproduced these findings. Inference of stimulation sensitivity was employed in simulated visual reconstruction, revealing that the approach could improve the function of future high-fidelity retinal implants.

                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and often debilitating. One complication following TBI is post-traumatic seizures (PTS). However, there is a poor understanding of PTS, in part, because it is challenging to model. We sought to develop a fly model of PTS. We used a high-impact trauma (HIT) device to inflict TBI and followed this with behavioral, bang-testing methods to assess seizure behavior. Our results showed PTS incidence was sensitive to genetic background. We also found seizure duration was most pronounced at 30 minutes after injury. Our findings support the efficacy of our fly model for coarse screening of seizure behavior. We expect this model will be useful in first-pass screens intended to identify modifiers of seizure risk following TBI.

                Background: While functional connectivity is widely studied, there has been little work studying functional connectivity at different spatial scales. Likewise, the relationship of functional connectivity between spatial scales is unknown. Methods: We proposed an independent component analysis (ICA) - based approach to capture information at multiple model orders (component numbers) and to evaluate functional network connectivity (FNC) both within and between model orders. We evaluated the approach by studying group differences in the context of a study of resting fMRI (rsfMRI) data collected from schizophrenia (SZ) individuals and healthy controls (HC). The predictive ability of FNC at multiple spatial scales was assessed using support vector machine (SVM)-based classification. Results: In addition to consistent predictive patterns at both multiple-model orders and single model orders, unique predictive information was seen at multiple-model orders and in the interaction between model orders. We observed that the FNC between model order 25 and 50 maintained the highest predictive information between HC and SZ. Results highlighted the predictive ability of the somatomotor and visual domains both within and between model orders compared to other functional domains. Also, subcortical-somatomotor, temporal-somatomotor, and temporal-subcortical FNCs had relatively high weights in predicting SZ. Conclusions: In sum, multi-model order ICA provides a more comprehensive way to study FNC, produces meaningful and interesting results which are applicable to future studies. We shared the spatial templates from this work at different model orders to provide a reference for the community, which can be leveraged in regression-based or fully automated (spatially constrained) ICA approaches.

	<p>Combined treatments using polyphenols and omega fatty acids provide several therapeutic benefits for a variety of age-related disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previously, we found a commercial product, Total Body Rhythm (TBR), consisting of tart cherry extract, a potent polyphenol, and omega fatty acids, significantly reduced memory, and neuropathological deficits in the 192 IgG-saporin mouse model of AD. The present study assessed the efficacy of TBR for treating behavioral and neuropathological deficits in the 5xFAD model of AD. Both 6- and 12-month-old 5xFAD mice and age-matched wild-type controls received TBR (60 mg/kg) or the equivalent dose of vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) via oral administration, every other day for two months. All mice were tested in the open field (OF), novel object recognition (NOR), and the Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. In addition, neuronal morphology, neurodegeneration, Aβ plaque load, and glial activation were assessed. TBR treatment reduced memory deficits in the MWM and NOR tests and lessened anxiety levels in the OF task, mostly in the 6-month-old male mice. TBR also protected against neuron loss, reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia, primarily in 6-month-old mice, and attenuated Aβ deposition. These results suggest that the combination of tart cherry extract and omega fatty acids in TBR can reduce AD-like deficits in 5xFAD mice.</p>

	<p>Age-related spatial navigation decline is more pronounced in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. We used a realistic-looking virtual navigation test suite to analyze different aspects of visuospatial processing in typical and atypical aging. A total of 219 older adults were recruited from the Czech Brain Aging Study cohort. Cognitively normal older adults (CN; n = 78), patients with amnestic MCI (n = 75), and those with mild AD dementia (n = 66) underwent three navigational tasks, cognitive assessment, and brain MRI. Route learning and wayfinding/perspective-taking tasks distinguished the groups as performance and learning declined and specific visuospatial strategies were less utilized with increasing cognitive impairment. Increased perspective shift and utilization of non-specific strategies were associated with worse task performance across the groups. Primacy and recency effects were observed across the groups in the route learning and the wayfinding/perspective-taking task, respectively. In addition, a primacy effect was present in the wayfinding/perspective-taking task in the CN older adults. More effective spatial navigation was associated with better memory and executive functions. The results demonstrate that a realistic and ecologically valid spatial navigation test suite can reveal different aspects of visuospatial processing in typical and atypical aging.</p>

	<p>Theoretical models of sleep and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest that symptoms of ADHD are associated with daytime sleepiness, but it has received little support. The present study aimed at testing an alternative model involving the association of attentional instability with sleep instability, i.e., sleep stage transitions and arousals. Twelve ADHD and 15 healthy control (HC) boys aged between 8 and 12 years old underwent polysomnography recording and attentional testing. The microarousal index, the number of awakenings, and the number of stage shifts between stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM sleep throughout the night were computed as sleep stability parameters. Attentional functioning was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test-II. We found significantly higher sleep instability in ADHD compared to HC. Sleep arousals and stage transitions (micro arousal index, stage 4/3 and 2/4 transitions) in ADHD significantly correlated with lower attentional scores. No association whatsoever was found between sleep instability and attentional functioning in HC. The results show that sleep instability is associated with lower attentional performance in boys with ADHD, but not in HC. This could be compatible with a model according to which attention and sleep stability share a common neural substrate in ADHD.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the association of cognition with hazardous drinking Polygenic Scores (PGS) in 2649 schizophrenia, 558 schizoaffective disorder, and 1125 bipolar disorder patients in Finland. Hazardous drinking PGS was computed using the LDPred program. Participants performed two computerized tasks from the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) on a tablet computer: the 5-choice serial reaction time task, or Reaction Time (RT) test, and the Paired Associative Learning (PAL) test. The association between hazardous drinking PGS and cognition was measured using four cognition variables. Log-linear regression was used in Reaction Time (RT) assessment, and logistic regression was used in PAL assessment. All analyses were conducted separately for males and females. After adjustment of age, age of onset, education, household pattern, and depressive symptoms, hazardous drinking PGS was not associated with reaction time or visual memory in male or female patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorder.</p>

	<p>In order to avoid erroneous braking responses when vehicle drivers are faced with a stressful setting, a K-order propagation number algorithm–Feature selection–Classification System (KFCS)is developed in this paper to detect emergency braking intentions in simulated driving scenarios using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Two approaches are employed in KFCS to extract EEG features and to improve classification performance: the K-Order Propagation Number Algorithm is the former, calculating the node importance from the perspective of brain networks as a novel approach; the latter uses a set of feature extraction algorithms to adjust the thresholds. Working with the data collected from seven subjects, the highest classification accuracy of a single trial can reach over 90%, with an overall accuracy of 83%. Furthermore, this paper attempts to investigate the mechanisms of brain activeness under two scenarios by using a topography technique at the sensor-data level. The results suggest that the active regions at two states is different, which leaves further exploration for future investigations.</p>

	<p>In two studies, we examine the test-retest reliability and factor structure of the computerized Tower of London (TOL) and Go/No Go (GNG). Before analyses, raw results of variables that were not normally distributed were transformed. Study 1 examined the reliability of a broad spectrum of indicators (Initial Time Thinking, ITT; Execution Time, ET; Full Time, FT; Extra Moves, EM; No Go Errors, NGE; Reaction Time for Go Responses, RTGR) across an eight-week delay in a sample of 20 young adults. After correction for multiple comparisons and correlations, our results demonstrate that the tasks have ambiguous test-retest reliability coefficients (non-significant r for all indicators, and interclass correlation (ICC) for TOL; significant ICC for GNG; show lack of reliable change over time for all indicators in both tasks); moreover, ITT exhibits strong practice effects. Study 2 investigated both tasks’ factor structure and conducted a more detailed analysis of indicators for each trial (ITT, ET, EM) in the TOL task in the group of 95 young adults. Results reveal a satisfactory 2-factor solution, with the first factor (planning inhibition) defined by ITT, NGE, and RTGR, and the second factor (move efficiency) defined by EM and ET. The detailed analysis identified a 6-factor solution with the first factor defined by ITT for more difficult trials and the remaining five factors defined by EM and ET for each trial, reflecting move efficiency for each trial separately.</p>

	<p>Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face unique challenges, which may affect parenting functioning. However, little is known about gender and cultural variations in parenting stress and styles in these families. The aims of this study were to investigate: (1a) the differences in parenting stress and (1b) social style between Italian and Japanese mothers and fathers of children with ASD; (2) the predictive role of culture, sociodemographic, and child’s characteristics on parenting stress; (3) the predictors of the social parenting style, including parenting stress dimensions. The study involved 92 Italians and 89 Japanese parents of school-age children (5–12 years) with ASD who completed the Parenting Stress Index and the Parenting Style Questionnaire. Results revealed that Japanese parents showed higher parenting stress and less engagement in social style than Italians. Across cultures, mothers used more social style than fathers. Being Japanese and having a child with greater ASD severity predicted higher levels of parenting stress. We also found that country, parent’s gender, and stress related to the dysfunctional interaction were significant predictors of parenting social style. Our findings highlight the importance of a cross-cultural approach to better understand the experiences and needs of mothers and fathers of children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Recent studies using full-field electroretinography (ffERG) that triggers a non-specific mass response generated by several retinal sources have attributed an important role for cannabinoid receptors in mediating vision in primates. Specific cone-mediated responses evoked through the photopic flicker ERG appear to be a better way to validate the assumption that endogenous cannabinoids modulate the cone pathway, since FAAH is mainly expressed in the vervet monkey cone photoreceptors. The aim of this study is two-fold: (1) to use the photopic flicker ERG to target the cone pathway specifically, and (2) use URB597 as a selective inhibitor of the endocannabinoid degrading enzyme Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) to enhance the levels of fatty acid amides, particularly anandamide. We recorded ERGs under four different flicker frequencies (15, 20, 25, and 30 Hz) in light-adapted conditions after intravitreal injections of URB597. Our results show that intravitreal injections of URB597, compared to the vehicle DMSO, increased significantly ffERG amplitudes at 30 Hz, a frequency that solely recruits cone activity. However, at 15 Hz, a frequency that activates both rods and cones, no significant difference was found in the ERG response amplitude. Additionally, we found no differences in implicit times after URB597 injections compared to DMSO vehicle. These results support the role of molecules degraded by FAAH in cone-mediated vision in non-human primates.</p>

	<p>Background: Physical exercise is an effective measure for preventing the onset of cognitive decline and has a direct influence on the aging process. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a 6-month physical exercise program on cognition and telomere length in adults over 65 years of age. Method: Seventy-four healthy women were separated into two groups: 41 were included in the intervention group (IG) (72.70 ± 4.127 years and 8.18 ± 1.551 years of education) and 33 in the control group (CG) (71.21 ± 4.127 years and 8.42 ± 2.562). The participants included within the IG carried out three sessions of physical exercise per week for six months. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Stroop test and the Trail Making Test (TMT). Saliva samples were taken and analyzed and relative telomere length was calculated. Those conducting the analysis were blind to the group to which the participants had been assigned. Results: An improvement was observed in global cognitive function, in both attentional and executive functions, in the group of adults doing physical exercise as compared to the control group. Six months after the physical exercise program had finished, relative telomere length was found to have increased in the participants in the intervention group.

	<p>Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most important neuroimaging techniques; nevertheless, the acoustic noise of the MR scanner is unavoidably linked to the process of data acquisition. We hypothesized that the auditory noise of the scanner has an effect on autonomic activity. Methods: We measured heart rate variability (HRV) while exposing 30 healthy subjects to fMRI noise. In doing so, we demonstrated an increase in parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity compared to silence and white noise and a decrease in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity compared to white noise. Conclusions: The influence of MR scanner noise on the autonomic nervous system should be taken into account when performing fMRI experiments.</p>

	<p>One of the daunting features of the brain is its physiology complexity, which arises from the interaction of numerous neuronal circuits that operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, enabling the brain to adapt to the constantly changing environment and to perform various cognitive functions. As a reflection of the complexity of brain physiology, the complexity of brain blood-oxygen signal has been frequently studied in recent years. This paper reviews previous literature regarding the following three aspects: (1) whether the complexity of the brain blood-oxygen signal can serve as a reliable biomarker for distinguishing different patient populations; (2) which is the best algorithm for complexity measure? And (3) how to select the optimal parameters for complexity measures. We then discuss future directions for blood-oxygen signal complexity analysis, including improving complexity measurement based on the characteristics of both spatial patterns of brain blood-oxygen signal and latency of complexity itself. In conclusion, the current review helps to better understand complexity analysis in brain blood-oxygen signal analysis and provide useful information for future studies.</p>

                Background - With the recent evolution of Financial Technology (FinTech), 11 peers to peer (P2P) lending platforms have been regulated by the Securities Commission in Malaysia since 2016. P2P lending platforms offer new investment opportunities to individual investors to earn higher rates on return than what traditional lenders usually provide. However, individual investors may face higher potential risks of default from their borrowers. Therefore, individual investors need to understand the potential exposure to such P2P lending platforms to make an effective investment decision. This study aims to explore the potential risk exposures that individual investors may experience at Malaysia's licensed P2P lending platforms.   Methods - Based on data collected manually from nine P2P lending platforms over five months, relationships between interest rates and various risk classifying factors such as credit rating, industry, business stage, loan purpose, and loan duration are examined.    Results- This study shows that loans with a similar credit rating and with or without similar loan purpose; and a business stage may offer investors significantly different interest rates. In addition, loans with shorter durations may provide investors with higher interest rates than those with longer durations. Finally, loans issued by companies from the same industry appeared to be charged with similar interest. These findings are valuable to investors to prepare themselves before making their investments at the P2P lending platforms.   Conclusion- With first hand-collected data, this study provides an original insight into Malaysia's current P2P lending platforms. Findings obtained for relationships between interest rates and risk classifying factors such as credit rating, industry, business stage, loan purpose and loan duration are valuable to investors of Malaysian P2P lending platforms.

     alt="Distribution and daily oscillation of GABA in the circadian system of the cockroach Rhyparobia maderae"/>
<p>GABA is a prominent neurotransmitter in the circadian system of the Madeira cockroach. The GABA-immunoreactive network overlaps with the arborizations of clock networks expressing pigment-dispersing factor. GABA levels show daily fluctuations with maximum concentrations during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day, suggesting a sleep promoting role.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach, sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. All GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. The intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, showed higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Autism spectrum disorder in architecture perspective: a review of the literature and bibliometric assessment of research indexed in Web of Science [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The primary objective of this research paper was to explore the current state-of-the-art research on autism spectrum disorder from a designer's perspective. An increasing number of scholarly publications in this discipline have urged researcher interest in this topic; however, there is still a lack of quantitative analysis. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze global research output on autism spectrum disorder from a designer's perspective during 1992–2021. Methodology: A bibliometric method was employed to analyze the published literature from 1992–2021. 812 papers were downloaded from the Web of Science core collection for analysis focused on annual growth of literature, prolific authors, authorship pattern, productive organizations, countries, international collaboration, literature trends by keyword analysis, and identifying the funding agencies. Various bibliometrics and scientometrics software were used to analyze the data, namely Bibexcel, Biblioshiny, and VOS viewer. Results: There were 812 research papers published in 405 sources during 1992–2021. 2019 was noted as the most productive year (NP=101), and 2014 received the highest number of citations (TC=6634). Researchers preferred to publish as journal articles (NP=538; TC=24922). The University of Toronto, Canada, was identified as a productive institution with 42 publications and 5358 citations. The USA was the leading producing country with 433 publications, and most of the researchers publish their work in the journal "Scientific Reports" (NP=16). The word "autism" (NP=257) and "architecture" (NP=165) were the most frequently used keywords in autism research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence from simulation studies for selective constraints on the codon usage of the Angiosperm psbA gene</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Antonina Kalkus, Joy Barrett, Theyjasvi Ashok, Brian R. Morton</p>

The codon usage of the Angiosperm <i>psbA</i> gene is atypical for flowering plant chloroplast genes but similar to the codon usage observed in highly expressed plastid genes from some other Plantae, particularly Chlorobionta, lineages. The pattern of codon bias in these genes is suggestive of selection for a set of translationally optimal codons but the degree of bias towards these optimal codons is much weaker in the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene than in high expression plastid genes from lineages such as certain green algal groups. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain these observations. One is that the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene is currently under weak selective constraints for translation efficiency, the other is that there are no current selective constraints and we are observing the remnants of an ancestral codon adaptation that is decaying under mutational pressure. We test these two models using simulations studies that incorporate the context-dependent mutational properties of plant chloroplast DNA. We first reconstruct ancestral sequences and then simulate their evolution in the absence of selection on codon usage by using mutation dynamics estimated from intergenic regions. The results show that <i>psbA</i> has a significantly higher level of codon adaptation than expected while other chloroplast genes are within the range predicted by the simulations. These results suggest that there have been selective constraints on the codon usage of the flowering plant <i>psbA</i> gene during Angiosperm evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Assessing the drivers of syphilis among men who have sex with men in Switzerland reveals a key impact of screening frequency: A modelling study</a></h4>

Roth, Dunja Nicca, Matthias Cavassini, Manuel Battegay, Patrick Schmid, Enos Bernasconi, Huldrych F. Günthard, Andri Rauch, Roger D. Kouyos, the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) </p>

Over the last decade, syphilis diagnoses among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) have strongly increased in Europe. Understanding the drivers of the ongoing epidemic may aid to curb transmissions. In order to identify the drivers of syphilis transmission in MSM in Switzerland between 2006 and 2017 as well as the effect of potential interventions, we set up an epidemiological model stratified by syphilis stage, HIV-diagnosis, and behavioral factors to account for syphilis infectiousness and risk for transmission. In the main model, we used ‘reported non-steady partners’ (nsP) as the main proxy for sexual risk. We parameterized the model using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, Swiss Voluntary Counselling and Testing center, cross-sectional surveys among the Swiss MSM population, and published syphilis notifications from the Federal Office of Public Health. The main model reproduced the increase in syphilis diagnoses from 168 cases in 2006 to 418 cases in 2017. It estimated that between 2006 and 2017, MSM with HIV diagnosis had 45.9 times the median syphilis incidence of MSM without HIV diagnosis. Defining risk as condomless anal intercourse with nsP decreased model accuracy (sum of squared weighted residuals, 378.8 vs. 148.3). Counterfactual scenarios suggested that increasing screening of MSM without HIV diagnosis and with nsP from once every two years to twice per year may reduce syphilis incidence (at most 12.8% reduction by 2017). Whereas, increasing screening among MSM with HIV diagnosis and with nsP from once per year to twice per year may substantially reduce syphilis incidence over time (at least 63.5% reduction by 2017). The model suggests that reporting nsP regardless of condom use is suitable for risk stratification when modelling syphilis transmission. More frequent screening of MSM with HIV diagnosis, particularly those with nsP may aid to curb syphilis transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using ephaptic coupling to estimate the synaptic cleft resistivity of the calyx of Held synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Martijn C. Sierksma, J. Gerard G. Borst</p>

At synapses, the pre- and postsynaptic cells get so close that currents entering the cleft do not flow exclusively along its conductance, <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub>. A prominent example is found in the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), where the presynaptic action potential can be recorded in the postsynaptic cell in the form of a prespike. Here, we developed a theoretical framework for ephaptic coupling via the synaptic cleft, and we tested its predictions using the MNTB prespike recorded in voltage-clamp. The shape of the prespike is predicted to resemble either the first or the second derivative of the inverted presynaptic action potential if cleft currents dissipate either mostly capacitively or resistively, respectively. We found that the resistive dissipation scenario provided a better description of the prespike shape. Its size is predicted to scale with the fourth power of the radius of the synapse, explaining why intracellularly recorded prespikes are uncommon in the central nervous system. We show that presynaptic calcium currents also contribute to the prespike shape. This calcium prespike resembled the first derivative of the inverted calcium current, again as predicted by the resistive dissipation scenario. Using this calcium prespike, we obtained an estimate for <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub> of ~1 μS. We demonstrate that, for a circular synapse geometry, such as in conventional boutons or the immature calyx of Held, <i>g</i><sub>cl</sub> is scale-invariant and only defined by extracellular resistivity, which was ~75 Ωcm, and by cleft height. During development the calyx of Held develops fenestrations. We show that these fenestrations effectively minimize the cleft potentials generated by the adult action potential, which might otherwise interfere with calcium channel opening. We thus provide a quantitative account of the dissipation of currents by the synaptic cleft, which can be readily extrapolated to conventional, bouton-like synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The microbiome impacts host hybridization and speciation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Asia K. Miller, Camille S. Westlake, Karissa L. Cross, Brittany A. Leigh, Seth R. Bordenstein</p>

Microbial symbiosis and speciation profoundly shape the composition of life’s biodiversity. Despite the enormous contributions of these two fields to the foundations of modern biology, there is a vast and exciting frontier ahead for research, literature, and conferences to address the neglected prospects of merging their study. Here, we survey and synthesize exemplar cases of how endosymbionts and microbial communities affect animal hybridization and vice versa. We conclude that though the number of case studies remain nascent, the wide-ranging types of animals, microbes, and isolation barriers impacted by hybridization will likely prove general and a major new phase of study that includes the microbiome as part of the functional whole contributing to reproductive isolation. Though microorganisms were proposed to impact animal speciation a century ago, the weight of the evidence supporting this view has now reached a tipping point.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">On the optimality of the enzyme–substrate relationship in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hugo Dourado, Matteo Mori, Terence Hwa, Martin J. Lercher</p>

Much recent progress has been made to understand the impact of proteome allocation on bacterial growth; much less is known about the relationship between the abundances of the enzymes and their substrates, which jointly determine metabolic fluxes. Here, we report a correlation between the concentrations of enzymes and their substrates in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We suggest this relationship to be a consequence of optimal resource allocation, subject to an overall constraint on the biomass density: For a cellular reaction network composed of effectively irreversible reactions, maximal reaction flux is achieved when the dry mass allocated to each substrate is equal to the dry mass of the unsaturated (or “free”) enzymes waiting to consume it. Calculations based on this optimality principle successfully predict the quantitative relationship between the observed enzyme and metabolite abundances, parameterized only by molecular masses and enzyme–substrate dissociation constants (<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>). The corresponding organizing principle provides a fundamental rationale for cellular investment into different types of molecules, which may aid in the design of more efficient synthetic cellular systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of accidental pediatric scald burns in a tertiary care center: hot cauldron burns versus accidental spill burns [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scald burns result from exposure to high-temperature fluids and are more common in the pediatric age group. They occur mainly by two mechanisms: (i) spill and (ii) immersion (hot cauldron) burns. These two patterns differ in clinical characteristics and outcomes. Scalds cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. The objective of this study was to compare accidental spill burns and hot cauldron burns in a hospital setting. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the secondary data of scald cases admitted during the years 2019 and 2020 in a burn-dedicated tertiary care center. Total population sampling was adopted. Data analysis was done partly using SPSS, version-23, and Stata-15. Mann Whitney U-test and Chi-square/Fisher's exact test were done appropriately to find associations between different variables. Regression analysis was performed taking mortality events as the outcome of interest. Results: Out of 108 scald cases, 43 (39.8%) had hot cauldron burns and 65 (60.2%) had accidental spill burns. Overall mortality was 16 (14.8%), out of which hot cauldron burns and accidental spill burns comprised 12 (75.0%) and 4 (25.0%), respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed the type of scald, age, and Baux score found to be associated with mortality. Every one-year increment in age had a 29% lower odds of occurrence of mortality event (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.99, p=0.042). Likewise, every one-point increment in Baux score was associated with 19% higher odds of mortality (adjusted OR, 1.190; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32; p<0.001). Conclusions: Accidental spill burns were more common but mortality was significantly higher for hot cauldron burns. The majority of burn injuries occurred inside the kitchen emphasizing appropriate parental precautions. The risk of mortality was significantly higher in burn events occurring outside the house, and burns involving back, buttocks, perineum, and lower extremities.

<p>Upon infection of primary neurons, astrocytes and microglia with tick-borne encephalitis virus, astrocytes mount particularly high IFN-β responses that initially depend on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, is typically transmitted upon tick bite and can cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans. In TBEV-infected mice, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the downstream adaptor of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is needed to induce early type I interferon (IFN) responses and to confer protection. To characterize the brain-resident cell subset that produces protective IFN-β in TBEV-infected mice, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from mice and exposed these cell types to TBEV in vitro. Under such conditions, neurons showed the highest percentage of infected cells, whereas astrocytes and microglia were infected to a lesser extent. In the supernatant (SN) of infected neurons, IFN-β was not detectable, while infected astrocytes showed high and microglia low IFN-β expression. Transcriptome analyses of astrocytes implied that MAVS signaling was needed early after TBEV infection. Accordingly, MAVS-deficient astrocytes showed enhanced TBEV infection and significantly reduced early IFN-β responses. Nevertheless, at later time points, moderate amounts of IFN-β were detected in the SN of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Transcriptome analyses indicated that MAVS deficiency negatively affected the induction of early anti-viral responses, which resulted in significantly increased TBEV replication. Treatment with MyD88 and TRIF inhibiting peptides reduced only late IFN-β responses of TBEV-infected WT astrocytes and blocked entirely IFN-β responses of infected MAVS-deficient astrocytes. Thus, upon TBEV exposure of brain-resident cells, astrocytes are important IFN-β producers showing biphasic IFN-β induction that initially depends on MAVS and later on MyD88/TRIF signaling.</p>

<p>We have employed α-syn oligomer proximity ligation assay to detect early changes in α-syn aggregation in the (Thy-1)-h[A30P] α-syn transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is a pathological hallmark in the Parkinson´s disease (PD) brain. The formation of α-syn oligomers is believed to be an early pathogenic event and the A30P mutation in the gene encoding α-syn, causing familial PD, has been shown to cause an accelerated oligomerization. Due to the problem of preserving antigen conformation on tissue surfaces, α-syn oligomers are difficult to detect <i>ex vivo</i> using conventional immunohistochemistry with oligomer-selective antibodies. Herein, we have instead employed the previously reported α-syn oligomer proximity ligation assay (ASO-PLA), along with a wide variety of biochemical assays, to discern the pathological progression of α-syn oligomers and their impact on the dopaminergic system in male and female (Thy-1)-h[A30P]α-syn transgenic (A30P-tg) mice. Our results reveal a previously undetected abundance of α-syn oligomers in midbrain of young mice, whereas phosphorylated (pS129) and proteinase k-resistant α-syn species were observed to a larger extent in aged mice. Although we did not detect loss of dopaminergic neurons in A30P-tg mice, a dysregulation in the monoaminergic system was recorded in older mice. Taken together, ASO-PLA should be a useful method for the detection of early changes in α-syn aggregation on brain tissue, from experimental mouse models in addition to <i>post mortem</i> PD cases.</p>

     alt="The ependymal cell cytoskeleton in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice"/>
<p>The cytoskeleton of the cells lining the central canal of the mouse spinal cord undergoes important modifications following injury. Ependymal cells change their pronounced apicobasal polarity with a striking rearrangement of key cytoskeletal proteins (F-actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein) that may be key events in the response of these progenitor-like cells.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cytoskeleton of ependymal cells is fundamental to organize and maintain the normal architecture of the central canal (CC). However, little is known about the plasticity of cytoskeletal components after spinal cord injury. Here, we focus on the structural organization of the cytoskeleton of ependymal cells in the normal and injured spinal cord of mice (both females and males) using immunohistochemical and electron microscopy techniques. We found that in uninjured animals, the actin cytoskeleton (as revealed by phalloidin staining) was arranged following the typical pattern of polarized epithelial cells with conspicuous actin pools located in the apical domain of ependymal cells. Transmission electron microscopy images showed microvilli tufts, long cilia, and characteristic intercellular membrane specializations. After spinal cord injury, F-actin rearrangements paralleled by fine structural modifications of the apical domain of ependymal cells were observed. These changes involved disruptions of the apical actin pools as well as fine structural modifications of the microvilli tufts. When comparing the control and injured spinal cords, we also found modifications in the expression of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After injury, vimentin expression disappeared from the most apical domains of ependymal cells but the number of GFAP-expressing cells within the CC increased. As in other polarized epithelia, the plastic changes in the cytoskeleton may be critically involved in the reaction of ependymal cells following a traumatic injury of the spinal cord.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Unusual mortality rate differences and symptoms have been experienced by COVID-19 patients, and the postinfection symptoms called Long COVID-19 have also been widely experienced. A substantial percentage of COVID-19-infected individuals in specific health categories have been virtually asymptomatic, several other individuals in the same health categories have exhibited several unusual symptoms, and yet other individuals in the same health categories have fatal outcomes. It is now hypothesized that these differences in mortality rates and symptoms could be caused by a SARS-CoV-2 virus infection acting together with one or more latent pathogen infections in certain patients, through mutually beneficial induced immune cell dysfunctions, including T-cell exhaustion. A latent pathogen infection likely to be involved is the protozoan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, which infects approximately one third of the global human population. Furthermore, certain infections and cancers that cause T-cell exhaustion can also explain the more severe outcomes of other COVID-19 patients having several disease and cancer comorbidities.</p>

     alt="Altered static and dynamic functional network connectivity in temporal lobe epilepsy with different disease duration and their relationships with attention"/>
<p>Compared with healthy controls, patients with temporal lobe epilepsy patients with a shorter duration of disease showed differences in static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC). Compared with sFNC, dFNC analysis showed more and inconsistent inter-network functional connectivity abnormalities. At the same time, the variability of inter-network dFNC is correlated with orienting function.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain network alterations associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate altered patterns of static and dynamic functional network connectivity (sFNC and dFNC) in TLE with different durations of disease. In this study, 19 TLE patients with a disease duration of ≤5 years (TLE-SD), 24 TLE patients with a disease duration of &gt;5 years (TLE-LD), and 21 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and attention network test. We used group independent component analysis to determine the target resting-state networks. Sliding window correlation and <i>k</i>-means clustering analysis methods were used to obtain different dFNC states, temporal properties, and temporal variability. We then compared sFNC and dFNC between groups and found that compared with HCs, TLE-SD patients had increased sFNC between the dorsal attention network and sensorimotor network/visual network (VN), but decreased sFNC between the inferior–posterior default mode network and VN. In the strongly connected dFNC state, TLE-SD patients spent more time, had greater mean dwell time, and showed greater inconsistent abnormal network connectivity. There was a significant negative correlation between the temporal variability of auditory network- left fronto-parietal network connectivity and orienting effect. No significant differences in sFNC and dFNC were detected between TLE-LD and HC groups. These findings suggest that the damage and functional brain network abnormalities gradually occur in TLE patients after the onset of epilepsy, which might lead to functional network reorganization and compensatory remodeling as the disease progresses.</p>

<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) patients present higher frequency of intermediate monocytes expressing TLR10. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2-induced cytokine production.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral inflammation, particularly mediated by monocytes, can cause neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the mechanism of TLR2-induced cytokine impairment in peripheral monocytes from PD patients and the association between the presence of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes and PD severity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PD patients and healthy individuals were evaluated for TLR expression on monocyte subsets (CD14 and CD16 expression) using flow cytometry. Moreover, cytokines were evaluated using flow cytometry after stimulation with Pam<sub>3</sub>Cys (TLR2/TLR1 agonist) in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibodies to TLR10. The severity of PD was assessed using the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) and motor activity, anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and fatigue (PD Fatigue Scale-16) scales. The frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes and expression intensity of TLR2 and TLR10 were higher in patients with PD than healthy individuals. The frequency of intermediate monocytes (CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) was not significantly increased in patients with PD, but was the main monocyte subset expressing TLR10. The TLR2/TLR1-impaired cytokine production (IL-6, TNFα, IL-8, and IL-10) in PD patients was reversed by neutralizing TLR10. The high frequency of total CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes was associated with a reduction in the severity of PD according to the evaluation of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Peripheral monocytes from patients with PD showed phenotypic and functional alterations. The expression of TLR10 on monocytes can protect against PD by controlling TLR2-induced cytokine production. Furthermore, data suggested that a low frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>TLR10<sup>+</sup> monocytes indicates the severity of PD. The results identified new opportunities for the development of novel PD neuroprotective therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Recent insights on astrocyte mechanisms in CNS homeostasis, pathology, and repair</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play essential roles in development, homeostasis, injury, and repair of the central nervous system (CNS). Their development is tightly regulated by distinct spatial and temporal cues during embryogenesis and into adulthood throughout the CNS. Astrocytes have several important responsibilities such as regulating blood flow and permeability of the blood-CNS barrier, glucose metabolism and storage, synapse formation and function, and axon myelination. In CNS pathologies, astrocytes also play critical parts in both injury and repair mechanisms. Upon injury, they undergo a robust phenotypic shift known as “reactive astrogliosis,” which results in both constructive and deleterious outcomes. Astrocyte activation and migration at the site of injury provides an early defense mechanism to minimize the extent of injury by enveloping the lesion area. However, astrogliosis also contributes to the inhibitory microenvironment of CNS injury and potentiate secondary injury mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, which facilitate neurodegeneration in CNS pathologies. Intriguingly, reactive astrocytes are increasingly a focus in current therapeutic strategies as their activation can be modulated toward a neuroprotective and reparative phenotype. This review will discuss recent advancements in knowledge regarding the development and role of astrocytes in the healthy and pathological CNS. We will also review how astrocytes have been genetically modified to optimize their reparative potential after injury, and how they may be transdifferentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes to promote repair after CNS injury and neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Unconventional animal models for traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death worldwide. It is a complex injury that influences cellular physiology, causes neuronal cell death, and affects molecular pathways in the brain. This in turn can result in sensory, motor, and behavioral alterations that deeply impact the quality of life. Repetitive mild TBI can progress into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative condition linked to severe behavioral changes. While current animal models of TBI and CTE such as rodents, are useful to explore affected pathways, clinical findings therein have rarely translated into clinical applications, possibly because of the many morphofunctional differences between the model animals and humans. It is therefore important to complement these studies with alternative animal models that may better replicate the individuality of human TBI. Comparative studies in animals with naturally evolved brain protection such as bighorn sheep, woodpeckers, and whales, may provide preventive applications in humans. The advantages of an in-depth study of these unconventional animals are threefold. First, to increase knowledge of the often-understudied species in question; second, to improve common animal models based on the study of their extreme counterparts; and finally, to tap into a source of biological inspiration for comparative studies and translational applications in humans.</p>

<p>Using the MSMT-CSD-based connectome, we identified increased structural connectivity in Japanese male world-class gymnasts (WCGs), involving sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic subnetworks correlated with D-scores of floor, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and years of training. Our findings indicated brain anatomical network plasticity in WCGs resulting from long-term intensive training.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In athletes, long-term intensive training has been shown to increase unparalleled athletic ability and might induce brain plasticity. We evaluated the structural connectome of world-class gymnasts (WCGs), as mapped by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging probabilistic tractography and a multishell, multitissue constrained spherical deconvolution method to increase the precision of tractography at the tissue interfaces. The connectome was mapped in 10 Japanese male WCGs and in 10 age-matched male controls. Network-based statistic identified subnetworks with increased connectivity density in WCGs, involving the sensorimotor, default mode, attentional, visual, and limbic areas. It also revealed a significant association between the structural connectivity of some brain structures with functions closely related to the gymnastic skills and the D-score, which is used as an index of the gymnasts' specific physical abilities for each apparatus. Furthermore, graph theory analysis demonstrated the characteristics of brain anatomical topology in the WCGs. They displayed significantly increased global connectivity strength with decreased characteristic path length at the global level and higher nodal strength and degree in the sensorimotor, default mode, attention, and limbic/subcortical areas at the local level as compared with controls. Together, these findings extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that distinguish WCGs from controls and suggest brain anatomical network plasticity in WCGs resulting from long-term intensive training. Future studies should assess the contribution of genetic or early-life environmental factors in the brain network organization of WCGs. Furthermore, the indices of brain topology (i.e., connection density and graph theory indices) could become markers for the objective evaluation of gymnastic performance.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental stimuli such as temperature, food, and smell significantly influence the physiology and behavior of animals. Animals are differentially adapted to maintain their internal body functions in response to varied environmental conditions. These external cues are sensed by specialized neurons which are a part of the chemosensory and thermosensory systems. The inability to respond correctly to varied environmental conditions may result in compromised bodily functions and reduced longevity. For example, the ability to sense food is derived from the integrated action of olfactory and gustatory systems. The damage to the olfactory system will affect our decision of palatable food items which in turn can affect the response of the gustatory system, ultimately causing abnormal feeding habits. Recent studies have provided evidence that aging is regulated by sensory perception of environment. Aging is one of the most common causes of various neurodegenerative diseases and the perception of environmental cues is also found to regulate the development of neurodegenerative phenotype in several animal models. However, specific molecular signaling pathways involved in the process are not completely understood. The research conducted on one of the best-studied animal models of aging, <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, has demonstrated multiple examples of gene–environment interaction at the neuronal level which affects life span. The findings may be useful to identify the key neuronal regulators of aging and age-related diseases in humans owing to conserved core metabolic and aging pathways from worms to humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The homeodomain transcription factors sine oculis homeobox 3 (Six3) and ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) are required for brain development. Their expression in specific brain areas is maintained in adulthood, where their functions are poorly understood. To identify the roles of <i>Six3</i> and <i>Vax1</i> in neurons, we conditionally deleted each gene using <i>Synapsin<sup>cre</sup>
</i>, a promoter targeting maturing neurons, and generated <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females, but not males, had reduced fertility, due to impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation. In nocturnal rodents, the LH surge requires a precise timing signal from the brain's circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), near the time of activity onset. Indeed, both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females had impaired rhythmic SCN output, which was associated with weakened <i>Period 2</i> molecular clock function in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. These impairments were associated with a reduction of the SCN neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide in <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice and a modest weakening of SCN timekeeping function in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> mice. Changes in SCN function were associated with mistimed peak PER2::LUC expression in the SCN and pituitary in both <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> and <i>Vax1<sup>syn</sup>
</i> females. Interestingly, <i>Six3<sup>syn</sup>
</i> ovaries presented reduced sensitivity to LH, causing reduced ovulation during superovulation. In conclusion, we have identified novel roles of the homeodomain transcription factors SIX3 and VAX1 in neurons, where they are required for proper molecular circadian clock function, SCN rhythmic output, and female fertility.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visually appreciable white matter (WM) changes have been described in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few data exist on the involvement of silent WM abnormalities. This prospective study investigated the microstructural integrity of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in male OSA patients before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, using a neuroimaging approach. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 32 participants (16 severe never-treated OSA and 16 controls). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were used to assess the microstructural NAWM changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In order to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, OSA patients underwent MRI evaluations at baseline and after 3 months of treatment (follow-up). CPAP treatment significantly increased the FA in NAWM of the brain stem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow-up compared to baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, TFCE-corrected). OSA patients also showed increases in AD in the corpus callosum, superior corona radiata, and internal capsule of the right hemisphere (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, TFCE-corrected) after CPAP treatment. A significant negative correlation was found between the FA of the corona radiata, corpus callosum, internal capsule, limbic structures, and neuropsychological scores at follow-up evaluation. No significant differences were found in MD and RD of NAWM in our patients after treatment. Our results demonstrate that FA and AD of NAWM in major tracts such as the corpus callosum and the internal capsule increased significantly after CPAP treatment, as a potential beneficial effect of ventilatory therapy. The recovery of NAWM alterations might also be related to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile, suggesting that nonclearly visible WM alterations may contribute to the physiopathology of OSA-related cognitive impairment.</p>

     alt="AMPA induced cognitive impairment in rats: Establishing the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, 4-PBA"/>
<p>The effect of AMPA induced excitotoxicity was studied on the rat hippocampus. AMPA apprehended the expression of GLUR receptors which afflict ER environment, thus inducing UPR and other cognitive impairments. Inhibiting ER stress with its specific inhibitor 4-PBA apprehended cognitive impairment and maintained neurotransmitters levels in addition to detaining UPR induced neuronal damage.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate excitotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) recently have been found to be instrumental in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the paucity of literature deciphering the inter-linkage among glutamate receptors, behavioral alterations, and ER demands thorough exploration. Reckoning the aforesaid concerns, a prospective study was outlined to delineate the influence of ER stress inhibition <i>via</i> 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) excitotoxicity-induced behavioral aspects and possible ER stress-glutamate linkage. Male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups namely sham (surgical control+vehicle, group 1), AMPA-induced excitotoxic group 2 receive a single intra-hippocampal injection of 10 mM AMPA, group 3 received AMPA along with PBA (i.p, 100 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days, and group 4 received PBA alone. Behavioral analyses were performed prior to the sacrifice of animals and hippocampus was extracted thereafter for further analysis. AMPA-induced excitotoxicity exhibited significant impairment of locomotion as well as cognitive functions. The levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, homo vanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine, and serotonin were reduced accompanied by reduced expression of GLUR1 and GLUR4 (glutamate receptor) as well as loss of neurons in different layers of hippocampus. ER stress markers were upregulated upon AMPA excitotoxicity. However, chemical chaperone PBA supplementation remarkably mitigated the behavioral alterations along with expression of glutamate and ER stress intermediates/markers in AMPA excitotoxic animals. Therefore, the present exploration convincingly emphasizes the significance of ER stress and its inhibition <i>via</i> PBA in combating cognitive impairment as well as improving locomotion in excitotoxic animals.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social interactions are partly driven by our ability to empathize—the capacity to share and understand others’ inner states. While a growing body of evidence suggests a link between past experiences and empathy, to what degree empathy is dependent on our own previous experiences (autobiographical memories, AMs) is still unclear. Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self-perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self-rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.</p>

<p>Resilience to stress in male rats is lost 2 weeks after social defeat stress.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Resilience to stress is the ability to quickly adapt to adversity. There is evidence that exposure to prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation what produces individual differences in stress vulnerability. However, the relationship between stress resilience, neuroinflammation, and depressive-like behaviors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term effects of social defeat stress (SDS) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and depressive-like behaviors. Male rats were subjected to the SDS paradigm. Social interaction was analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after ending the SDS to determine which animals were susceptible or resilient to stress. Neuroinflammation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, and elevated membrane permeability in astrocytes and microglia, as well as depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated in all rats. One week after SDS, resilient rats increased their sucrose preference, and time spent in the floating behavior decreased in the forced swim test compared to susceptible rats. Surprisingly, resilient rats became susceptible to stress, and presented neuroinflammation 2 weeks after SDS. These findings suggest that SDS-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation persists in post-stress stages, regardless of whether rats were initially resilient or not. Our study opens a new approach to understanding the neurobiology of stress resilience.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health-care system. To date, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD-immanent deterioration of domain-general functions and domain-specific numerical areas suggests the mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study will systematically investigate basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain-general factors. The overall sample consists of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients will be stratified into patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (level I-PD-MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing will be assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non)symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis will be employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants will be subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Study results will give the first broad insight into the extent of basic numerical deficits in different PD patient groups and will help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of the numerical deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.</p>

<p>The illustration of the generation of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells from SCPs associated with nerves during zebrafish development. In fish, peripheral nerve-associated SCPs detach and generate the majority of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells over significant periods of development and growth.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The autonomic portion of the peripheral nervous system orchestrates tissue homeostasis through direct innervation of internal organs, and via release of adrenalin and noradrenalin into the blood flow. The developmental mechanisms behind the formation of autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells are not fully understood. Using genetic tracing, we discovered that a significant proportion of sympathetic neurons in zebrafish originates from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) during a defined period of embryonic development. Moreover, SCPs give rise to the main portion of the chromaffin cells, as well as to a significant proportion of enteric and other autonomic neurons associated with internal organs. The conversion of SCPs into neuronal and chromaffin cells is ErbB receptor dependent, as the pharmacological inhibition of the ErbB pathway effectively perturbed this transition. Finally, using genetic ablations, we revealed that SCPs producing neurons and chromaffin cells migrate along spinal motor axons to reach appropriate target locations. This study reveals the evolutionary conservation of SCP-to-neuron and SCP-to-chromaffin cell transitions over significant growth periods in fish and highlights relevant cellular-genetic mechanisms. Based on this, we anticipate that multipotent SCPs might be present in postnatal vertebrate tissues, retaining the capacity to regenerate autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells.</p>

<p>Can transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improve implicit motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease? A comparison with neurologically healthy, age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research on healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects—hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, only null effects have been reported in persons with PD. However, these studies did not determine the reacquisition effects, although previous studies in healthy young adults suggest that tDCS specifically exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL on reacquisition rather than acquisition. In the current study, we will therefore establish possible reacquisition effects, which are of a particular interest, as long-term effects are vital for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD. Using a sham-controlled, counterbalanced design, we will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the serial reaction time task, in persons with PD and a neurologically healthy age- and sex-matched control (HC) group. Multilevel Mixed Models will be implemented to analyze the sequence-specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome) and general learning (secondary outcome). We will determine not only the immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also the short-term (5 min post-tDCS) and long-term (1 week post-tDCS) reacquisition effects.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting-state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain-specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil-and-paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central-executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Different mutations in the <i>cadherin 23</i> (<i>CDH23</i>) gene in different genetic backgrounds have been linked to either syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans. We previously reported a progressive hearing loss (HL) mouse model, the <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mouse, which carries a 208T &gt; C mutation causing an amino acid substitution at S70P in C57BL/6J mice. To investigate the differences in <i>Cdh23</i> mutation-related HL in different genetic backgrounds, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate homozygous mice in the CBA/CaJ background that have the same base pair missense mutation (208T &gt; C) (<i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i>) as <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice in the C57BL/6J background or a single base pair deletion (235G) (<i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i>) in the <i>Cdh23</i> gene at exon 5. The two mutant mice exhibit hearing impairment across a broad range of frequencies. The progression of HL in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i> mice is slower than that in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice. We also found structural abnormalities in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl2/erl2</sup>
</i> and <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice. <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice show signs of vestibular dysfunction in open field behavior and swimming tests. In addition, we observed hair bundle defects in vestibular hair cells in <i>Cdh23<sup>V2J2/V2J2</sup>
</i> mice. Our results suggest an interaction between the <i>erl</i> locus and the C57BL/6J background that exacerbates HL in <i>Cdh23<sup>erl/erl</sup>
</i> mice. Moreover, our study confirms that the <i>Cdh23</i> gene is essential for normal hearing and balance. These two novel mutant mouse strains provide excellent models for studying <i>CDH23</i> mutation-related deafness in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a focal epilepsy whose neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to identify possible neurochemical alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants with SHE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS). Thirty-nine participants with SHE (mean age, 30.7 years ± 11.3 [standard deviation], 24 men) and 59 controls (mean age, 29.4 years ± 10.4, 29 men) were consecutively and prospectively recruited and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>1</sup>H MRS in the bilateral DLPFCs. Brain concentrations of metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), <i>myo</i>-inositol (mI), choline, creatine, the sum of glutamate and glutamine, glutathione (GSH) and <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid, were estimated with LCModel and corrected for the partial volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid using tissue segmentation. ANCOVA analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. A significant difference of NAA concentration between DLPFC in the two hemispheres (left &gt; right) was observed only in the control group. We further confirmed a higher GSH concentration in men than in women in SHE participants, which probably indicates that men are more susceptible to this disease. The mI concentration in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with epilepsy duration. This study demonstrates that DLPFC is an important brain region involved in the pathophysiology of SHE, in which both neurons and astrocytes appear impaired, and the elevated GSH level may suggest an abnormality related to oxidative stress.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Repetitive behavioral phenotypes are a trait of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Such behaviors are typified by complex interactions between cognitive and neurobiological processes which most likely contribute to the suboptimal treatment responses often observed. To this end, exploration of the adenosinergic system may be useful, since adenosine-receptor modulation has previously shown promise to restore control over voluntary behavior and improve cognition in patients presenting with motor repetition. Here, we employed the deer mouse <i>(Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii)</i> model of compulsive-like behavioral persistence, seeking to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T-maze continuous alternation task (T-CAT). The effect of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist at two doses (10 and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>) on the expression of stereotypy and T-CAT performance in high (H) and non-(N) stereotypical animals, was investigated in comparison to a control intervention (six groups; <i>n</i> = 8 or 9 per group). No correlation between H behavior and T-CAT performance was found. However, H but not N animals presented with istradefylline-sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals. Thus, evidence is presented that anti-adenosinergic drug action improves repetitive behavior and spontaneous alternation in stereotypical deer mice, putatively pointing to a shared psychobiological construct underlying naturalistic stereotypy and alterations in cognitive flexibility in deer mice.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (Hc) is composed of cytoarchitectonically distinct subfields: dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis sectors 1-3 (CA1-3), and subiculum. Limited evidence suggests differential maturation rates across the Hc subfields. While longitudinal studies are essential in demonstrating differential development of Hc subfields, a prerequisite for interpreting meaningful longitudinal effects is establishing test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured <i>in vivo</i> over time. Here, we examined test–retest consistency of Hc subfield volumes measured from structural MR images in two independent developmental samples. Sample One (<i>n</i> = 28, ages 7–20 years, <i>M</i> = 12.64, <i>SD</i> = 3.35) and Sample Two (<i>n</i> = 28, ages 7–17 years, <i>M</i> = 11.72, <i>SD</i> = 2.88) underwent MRI twice with a 1-month and a 2-year delay, respectively. High-resolution PD-TSE-T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MR images (0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>) were collected and manually traced using a longitudinal manual demarcation protocol. In both samples, we found excellent consistency of Hc subfield volumes between the two visits, assessed by two-way mixed intraclass correlation (ICC (3) single measures ≥ 0.87), and no difference between children and adolescents. The results further indicated that discrepancies between repeated measures were not related to Hc subfield volumes, or visit number. In addition to high consistency, with the applied longitudinal protocol, we detected significant variability in Hc subfield volume changes over the 2-year delay, implying high sensitivity of the method in detecting individual differences. Establishing unbiased, high longitudinal consistency of Hc subfield volume measurements optimizes statistical power of a hypothesis test and reduces standard error of the estimate, together improving external validity of the measures in constructing theoretical models of memory development.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cilia are dynamic subcellular systems, with core structural and functional components operating in a highly coordinated manner. Since many environmental stimuli sensed by cilia are circadian in nature, it is reasonable to speculate that genes encoding cilia structural and functional components follow rhythmic circadian patterns of expression. Using computational methods and the largest spatiotemporal gene expression atlas of primates, we identified and analyzed the circadian rhythmic expression of cilia genes across 22 primate brain areas. We found that around 73% of cilia transcripts exhibited circadian rhythmicity across at least one of 22 brain regions. In 12 brain regions, cilia transcriptomes were significantly enriched with circadian oscillating transcripts, as compared to the rest of the transcriptome. The phase of the cilia circadian transcripts deviated from the phase of the majority of the background circadian transcripts, and transcripts coding for cilia basal body components accounted for the majority of cilia circadian transcripts. In addition, adjacent or functionally connected brain nuclei had large overlapping complements of circadian cilia genes. Most remarkably, cilia circadian transcripts shared across the basal ganglia nuclei and the prefrontal cortex peaked in these structures in sequential fashion that is similar to the sequential order of activation of the basal ganglia-cortical circuitry in connection with movement coordination, albeit on completely different timescales. These findings support a role for the circadian spatiotemporal orchestration of cilia gene expression in the normal physiology of the basal ganglia-cortical circuit and motor control. Studying orchestrated cilia rhythmicity in the basal ganglia-cortical circuits and other brain circuits may help develop better functional models, and shed light on the causal effects cilia functions have on these circuits and on the regulation of movement and other behaviors.</p>

<p>Murugappan et al., report that trigeminal neuropathy causes desynchronization and reduces neuronal communications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-basolateral amygdala neural circuitry, associated with hypomyelination and reduced myelinating cells. The hypomyelination and desynchronization in the ACC lead to poor decision-making in male rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Infraorbital nerve-chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI) has become the most popular chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) injury animal model which causes prolonged mechanical allodynia. Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.</p>

<p>In this randomized controlled trial, we found little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program influenced brain structural connectivity networks compared with a placebo program in children born extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Children born extremely preterm (EP, &lt;28 weeks’ gestation) or extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &lt;1,000 g) are a vulnerable population at high risk of working memory impairments. We aimed to examine changes in the brain structural connectivity networks thought to underlie working memory performance, after completion of a working memory training program (Cogmed) compared with a placebo program in EP/ELBW children. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial (the Improving Memory in a Preterm Randomised Intervention Trial). Children born EP/ELBW received either the Cogmed or placebo program at 7 years of age (<i>n</i> = 91). A subset of children had magnetic resonance imaging of the brain immediately pre- and 2 weeks post-training (Cogmed <i>n</i> = 28; placebo <i>n</i> = 27). <i>T</i>
<sub>1</sub>-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were used to perform graph theoretical analysis of structural connectivity networks. Changes from pre-training to post-training in structural connectivity metrics were generally similar between randomized groups. There was little evidence that changes in structural connectivity metrics were related to changes in working memory performance from pre- to post-training. Overall, our results provide little evidence that the Cogmed working memory training program has training-specific effects on structural connectivity networks in EP/ELBW children.</p>

     alt="Post-training stimulation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impairs working memory training performance"/>
<p>We delivered transcranial direct current stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex before, during, or after working memory training in order to assess the optimal stimulation timing to maximize learning. Although our procedure did not end up eliciting learning benefits, we did find that stimulation immediately after training <i>impaired</i> performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research investigating transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive training augments both our understanding of its long-term effects on cognitive plasticity as well as potential applications to strengthen cognitive interventions. Previous work has demonstrated enhancement of working memory training while applying concurrent tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, the optimal stimulation parameters are still unknown. For example, the timing of tDCS delivery has been shown to be an influential variable that can interact with task learning. In the present study, we used tDCS to target the right DLPFC while participants trained on a visuospatial working memory task. We sought to compare the relative efficacy of online stimulation delivered during training to offline stimulation delivered either immediately before or afterwards. We were unable to replicate previously demonstrated benefits of online stimulation; however, we did find evidence that offline stimulation delivered after training can actually be detrimental to training performance relative to sham. We interpret our results in light of evidence suggesting a role of the right DLPFC in promoting memory interference, and conclude that while tDCS may be a promising tool to influence the results of cognitive training, more research and an abundance of caution are needed before fully endorsing its use for cognitive enhancement. This work suggests that effects can vary substantially in magnitude and direction between studies, and may be heavily dependent on a variety of intervention protocol parameters such as the timing and location of stimulation delivery, about which our understanding is still nascent.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor increases phosphomannomutase (PMM) enzyme activity in a PMM2-congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) worm model. Epalrestat also decreases sorbitol level in diabetic neuropathy. We evaluated the genetic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics, including the Nijmegen Progression CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), urine polyol levels and fibroblast glycoproteomics in patients with PMM2-CDG.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed PMM enzyme measurements, multiplexed proteomics, and glycoproteomics in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts before and after epalrestat treatment. Safety and efficacy of 0.8 mg/kg/day oral epalrestat were studied in a child with PMM2-CDG for 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PMM enzyme activity increased post-epalrestat treatment. Compared with controls, 24% of glycopeptides had reduced abundance in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts, 46% of which improved upon treatment. Total protein N-glycosylation improved upon epalrestat treatment bringing overall glycosylation toward the control fibroblasts’ glycosylation profile. Sorbitol levels were increased in the urine of 74% of patients with PMM2-CDG and correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy, and CDG severity rating scale. In the child with PMM2-CDG on epalrestat treatment, ataxia scores improved together with significant growth improvement. Urinary sorbitol levels nearly normalized in 3 months and blood transferrin glycosylation normalized in 6 months.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Epalrestat improved PMM enzyme activity, N-glycosylation, and glycosylation biomarkers in vitro. Leveraging cellular glycoproteome assessment, we provided a systems-level view of treatment efficacy and discovered potential novel biosignatures of therapy response. Epalrestat was well-tolerated and led to significant clinical improvements in the first pediatric patient with PMM2-CDG treated with epalrestat. We also propose urinary sorbitol as a novel biomarker for disease severity and treatment response in future clinical trials in PMM2-CDG. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">The organization of the zebrafish pallium from a hodological perspective</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is comprised of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd) and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl-Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.</p>

                Choy et al. develop an optogenetic model for epilepsy through repeated stimulations of the hippocampus. Using whole-brain functional imaging and electrical recordings, they uncover that kindling results in reorganization of brain-wide circuitry, engaging a larger brain-wide network upon stimulation, elevated anxiety, and a core of slow-migrating hippocampal activities.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">An active vesicle priming machinery suppresses axon regeneration upon adult CNS injury</a></h4>

              
                Combining genetic, pharmacogenetic, pharmacological, and transcriptomic approaches with live-cell, super-resolution, and 3-dimensional two-photon imaging, Hilton et al. demonstrate that critical components of the presynaptic transmitter release machinery actively inhibit axon growth. Munc13, a presynaptic active zone protein essential for synaptic transmission, suppresses axon regeneration following adult CNS injury.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Munc13-1 is a Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent vesicle priming hub that shapes synaptic short-term plasticity and enables sustained neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Using novel knockin mouse models, Lipstein et al. show that Ca2+-phospholipid binding activates the presynaptic protein Munc13-1 to fine-tune the rate of synaptic vesicle replenishment according to synaptic activity. This process determines short-term synaptic plasticity and the temporal fidelity of synaptic transmission in the auditory brainstem and the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Bidirectional control of infant rat social behavior via dopaminergic innervation of the basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Social interaction deficits seen in psychiatric disorders emerge in early life and are most closely linked to neural circuit dysfunction. Due to technical limitations, we have limited understanding of how social behavior circuits develop. These data highlight social adversity and elevated dopamine in amygdala as causal in producing aberrant social behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Neuronal cholesterol synthesis is essential for repair of chronically demyelinated lesions in mice</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous repair after chronic demyelination requires local cholesterol synthesis. Berghoff et al. show that in addition to oligodendroglia, neurons upregulate cholesterol synthesis in mouse models and patients with MS. Neuronal cholesterol facilitates repair, especially by augmenting proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
