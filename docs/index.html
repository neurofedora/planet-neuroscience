                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Many animal species use olfaction to extract information about objects in their environment. Yet, the specific molecular signature that any given object emits varies due to various factors. Here, we detail why such variability makes chemosensory-mediated object recognition such a hard problem, and we propose that a major function of the elaborate chemosensory network is to overcome it. We describe previous work addressing different elements of the problem and outline future research directions that we consider essential for a full understanding of object-oriented olfaction. In particular, we call for extensive representation of olfactory object variability in chemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological analyses. While written with an emphasis on macrosmatic mammalian species, our arguments apply to all organisms that employ chemosensation to navigate complex environments.

">Neural Representations of Extrasystoles: A Predictive Coding Perspective</a></h4>

              
                The coordinated interplay between brain and body is essential for survival, with the heart-brain axis playing a fundamental role in perceptual, cognitive and motor processes. Central to this interaction, the heart-evoked potential (HEP) represents a neural correlate of the heart activity. Further, the HEP is thought to represent a neuronal prediction for each heartbeat, raising questions about its role in arrhythmia. Yet, previous studies have primarily focused on regular heart rhythms, with only a few investigations delving into arrhythmias and, notably, none into extrasystoles, a form of benign arrhythmias that disrupt the regular heart rhythm. Extrasystoles represent a unique possibility for investigating brain responses to unexpected pronounced alterations in heart rhythm. We took advantage of the largest dataset (103 subjects with 3000 extrasystoles), including both EEG and ECG recordings, and analysed the neural response to both types of extrasystoles (supraventricular and ventricular) using multiverse approaches and control analysis in time and source space. We found that the HEP was significantly reduced for ventricular extrasystoles with underlying sources in the left insular. For the postextrasystolic beat of both types of extrasystoles, we found a significantly earlier and increased HEP originating from sources in the left frontal orbital cortex and the anterior cingulate gyri. The reduced HEP response to the ventricular extrasystole might result from inactive interoceptive cardiac pathways. In contrast, increased HEP of the postextrasystolic beat along with the anatomical neural HEP generators may reflect an interoceptive prediction error arising from a naturally occurring discrepancy between the predicted and actual heart rhythm, with a main source in the anterior cingulate gyri, a primary location for prediction error processing.

">Gradients of Recognition Molecules Shape Synaptic Specificity of a Visuomotor Transformation</a></h4>

              
                Converting sensory information into motor commands is fundamental to most of our actions. In Drosophila, visuomotor transformations are mediated by Visual Projection Neurons (VPNs). These neurons convert object location and motion into directional behaviors downstream through a synaptic gradient mechanism. However, the molecular origins of such graded connectivity remain unknown. We addressed this question in a VPN cell type called LPLC2, which integrates looming motion and transforms it into an escape response through two parallel dorsoventral synaptic gradients at its inputs and outputs. We identified two corresponding dorsoventral expression gradients of cell recognition molecules within the LPLC2 population that regulate this synaptic connectivity. Dpr13 determines synaptic outputs of LPLC2 axons by interacting with its binding partner DIP-{varepsilon} expressed in the Giant Fiber, a neuron that mediates escape. Similarly, beat-VI regulates synaptic inputs onto LPLC2 dendrites by interacting with Side-II expressed in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Behavioral, physiological, and molecular experiments demonstrate that these coordinated molecular gradients control differential synaptic connectivity, enabling the accurate transformation of visual features into motor commands. As within-neuronal-type variation in gene expression is also observed in the mammalian brain, graded expression of cell recognition molecules may represent a common mechanism underlying synaptic specificity.

">A generalizable normative deep autoencoder for brain morphological anomaly detection: application to the multi-site StratiBip dataset on bipolar disorder in an external validation framework.</a></h4>

              
                The heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders makes researching disorder-specific neurobiological markers an ill-posed problem. Here, we face the need for disease stratification models by presenting a generalizable multivariate normative modelling framework for characterizing brain morphology, applied to bipolar disorder (BD). We employed deep autoencoders in an anomaly detection framework, combined with a confounder removal step integrating training and external validation. The model was trained with healthy control (HC) data from the human connectome project and applied to multi-site external data of HC and BD individuals. We found that brain deviating scores were greater, more heterogeneous, and with increased extreme values in the BD group, with volumes prominently from the basal ganglia, hippocampus and adjacent regions emerging as significantly deviating. Similarly, individual brain deviating maps based on modified z scores expressed higher abnormalities occurrences, but their overall spatial overlap was lower compared to HCs. Our generalizable framework enabled the identification of subject- and group-level brain normative-deviating patterns, a step forward towards the development of more effective and personalized clinical decision support systems and patient stratification in psychiatry.

">Myosin XVA isoforms participate in the mechanotransduction-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in auditory stereocilia</a></h4>

              
                Auditory hair cells form precise and sensitive staircase-like actin protrusions known as stereocilia. These specialized microvilli detect deflections induced by sound through the activation of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) channels located at their tips. At rest, a small MET channel current results in a constant calcium influx, which regulates the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton in the shorter "transducing" stereocilia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this novel type of activity-driven plasticity in the stereocilium cytoskeleton are currently unknown. Here, we tested the contribution of myosin XVA (MYO15A) isoforms. We used electron microscopy to evaluate morphological changes in the cytoskeleton of auditory hair cell stereocilia after the pharmacological blockage of resting MET currents in cochlear explants from mice that lacked one or all isoforms of MYO15A. Hair cells lacking functional MYO15A isoforms did not exhibit MET-dependent remodeling in their stereocilia cytoskeleton. In contrast, hair cells that only lack the long isoform of MYO15A exhibited increased MET-dependent stereocilia remodeling, including remodeling in stereocilia from the tallest "non-transducing" row of the bundle. We conclude that MYO15A isoforms not only enable but also fine-tune the MET-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in transducing stereocilia and contribute to the stability of the tallest row.

">The spatial reference frame of history-driven distractor suppression and target enhancement</a></h4>

              
                The world around us is inherently structured and often repetitive. Research has shown that we can implicitly learn to prioritize relevant objects and locations while filtering out distracting information, creating an integrated priority map for attention allocation. The current study examines whether these attentional biases are tied to environment-dependent (allocentric) or viewpoint-dependent (egocentric) coordinates. The search display consisted of six stimuli that were surrounded by a wheel and square frame. In two experiments, either a distractor or a target appeared more frequently in one location, leading to the suppression or enhancement of that location, respectively. Learning blocks were followed by test blocks, where the surrounding frame rotated, creating egocentric-matching and allocentric-matching locations. These experiments showed that both target and distractor learning relied on an egocentric reference frame only. In follow-up experiments, the likely target and distractor location rotated dynamically with the frame during learning. This revealed that participants can learn to enhance a likely target location in an object-centered, allocentric manner. We hypothesized that while space-based learning feeds into a priority map reliant on an egocentric reference frame, object-based learning allows for implicit prioritization of subparts of objects independent of their spatial orientation.

                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by compulsive alcohol consumption and negative emotional states during withdrawal, often perpetuating a cycle of addiction through arousal dysfunction. The hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neuropeptide system, a key regulator of arousal, has been implicated in these processes, particularly in its interactions with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We investigated the role of Hcrt receptor signaling in CRF neurons in modulating alcohol intake, anxiety behaviors, and BNST excitability, with a focus on sex-specific differences. Using CRF-specific genetic deletion of HcrtR1 and/or HcrtR2 receptors in mice, we found that deletion of HcrtR1 significantly reduced alcohol intake, with sex-specific effects on BNST excitability. CRF-specific HcrtR2 deletion, while not affecting alcohol consumption, decreased baseline anxiety-like behaviors in males relative to females. Moreover, the double deletion of both Hcrt receptors from CRF neurons led to reduced alcohol drinking in males and dampened anxiety behaviors and BNST excitability in both sexes during protracted withdrawal. These findings suggest that Hcrt signaling in CRF neurons plays a critical role in the persistence of excessive alcohol consumption and the development of negative affective states, with distinct contributions from HcrtR1 and HcrtR2. The observed sex-specific differences underscore the need for tailored therapeutic approaches targeting the Hcrt system in the treatment of AUD.

">Astrocytic Regulation of Cocaine Locomotor Sensitization in EcoHIV Infected Mice</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is highly comorbid with HIV infection and worsens HIV outcomes. Preclinical research on the outcomes of HIV infection may yield crucial information on neurobehavioral changes resulting from chronic drug exposure in people living with HIV (PLWH). Repeated exposure to cocaine alters behavioral responses to cocaine. This includes development of cocaine locomotor sensitization, or increased locomotor responses to the same doses of cocaine, which depends on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neural plasticity. NAc astrocytes are key regulators of neural activity and plasticity, and their function can be impaired by cocaine exposure and HIV infection, thus implicating them as potential regulators of HIV-induced changes in behavioral response to cocaine. To characterize the effects of HIV infection on cocaine locomotor sensitization, we employed the EcoHIV mouse model to assess changes in locomotor responses after repeated cocaine (10mg/kg) exposure and challenge. EcoHIV infection potentiated expression of cocaine sensitization. We also identified EcoHIV-induced increases in expression of the astrocytic nuclear marker Sox9 selectively in the NAc core. To investigate whether modulation of NAc astrocytes could reverse EcoHIV-induced deficits, we employed a chemogenetic approach. We found that chemogenetic activation of NAc astrocyte Gq signaling attenuated EcoHIV-enhanced cocaine sensitization. We propose that HIV infection contributes to cocaine behavioral sensitization and induces adaptations in NAc astrocytes, while promoting NAc astrocytic Gq-signaling can recover EcoHIV-induced behavioral changes. These findings identify potential cellular substrates of disordered cocaine-driven behavior in the context of HIV infection and point toward strategies to reduce cocaine-related behavior in PLWH.

">British Version of the Iowa Test of Consonant Perception</a></h4>

              
                The Iowa Test of Consonant Perception (ITCP) is a single-word closed-set speech-in-noise test with well-balanced phonetic features that provides a reliable testing option for real-world listening. Objectives: The current study aimed to establish a UK version of the test (B-ITCP) based on the British received pronunciation. Design: We conducted a validity test with 46 participants using the B-ITCP test, a sentence-in-noise test, and audiogram. Results: The B-ITCP demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability, cross-talker validity, and good convergent validity, consistent with the US results. Conclusions: These findings suggest that B-ITCP is a reliable measure of speech-in-noise perception, to facilitate comparative or combined studies in USA and UK. All materials (application and scripts) to run or construct the B-ITCP and ITCP are freely available online.

">Patch-leaving decisions and pupil-linked arousal systems</a></h4>

              
                Deciding when to abandon a depleting resource in favour of potentially richer alternatives is fundamental to adaptive behaviour. Such patch-leaving decisions require balancing the expected advantage of leaving against both the cost of moving and the reward foregone in the current environment. Previous research suggests that activity of noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) underpins patch-leaving. In the current study, we used pupil dilation as a time-resolved readout of subcortical neuromodulation during patch-leaving. We hypothesised that leave decisions will be preceded by a transient pupil dilation. Participants harvested from exponentially depleting patches (blueberry bushes) with three initial reward values, in two environments, which differed in the variability of initial reward values. Behavioural results show that, as predicted by the mathematically optimal solution, participants adjusted their decisions based on the instantaneous reward rate, but also displayed a bias to overharvest (stay longer in compared to the optimum), which was more pronounced in the high variability environment. Pupil size was overall larger in the high variability environment, associated with increased uncertainty. Importantly, we observed an increased transient pupil dilation in response to reward outcomes immediately preceding leave compared to stay decisions, as well as an increase in pupil dilation (and RT) across successive stay trials, leading up to leave decisions, presumably indicating an increased LC-NE activity associated with abandoning current options to explore alternatives.

">Remote ischemic conditioning attenuates transneuronal degeneration and promotes stroke recovery via CD36-mediated efferocytosis.</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Remote ischemic limb conditioning (RIC) has been implicated in cross-organ protection in cerebrovascular disease, including stroke. However, the lack of a consensus protocol and controversy over the clinical therapeutic outcomes of RIC suggest inadequate mechanistic understanding of RIC. The current study identifies RIC-induced molecular and cellular events in the blood that enhance long-term functional recovery in experimental cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Naive mice or mice subjected to transient ischemic stroke were randomly selected to receive sham conditioning or RIC in the hind limb at 2 h post-stroke. At 3d post-stroke, monocyte composition in the blood was analyzed, and brain tissue was examined for monocyte-derived macrophages (Mphi), levels of efferocytosis, and CD36 expression. Mouse with conditional deletion of CD36 in Mphi (cKOMMphi) was used to establish the role of CD36 in RIC-mediated modulation of efferocytosis, transneuronal degeneration, and recovery following stroke. RESULTS: RIC applied 2h after stroke increased entry of monocytes into the injured brain. In the post-ischemic brain, M? had increased levels of CD36 expression and efferocytosis. These changes in brain Mphi were derived from RIC-induced changes in circulating monocytes. In the blood, RIC increased CD36 expression in circulating monocytes and shifted monocytes to a proinflammatory LY6CHigh state. Conditional deletion of CD36 in Mphi abrogated the RIC-induced monocyte shift in the blood and efferocytosis in the brain. During the recovery phase of stroke, RIC rescued the loss of the volume and of tyrosine hydroxylase+ neurons in substantia nigra (SN) as well as behavioral deficits in WT mice, but not in cKOMMphi mice. CONCLUSIONS: RIC induces a shift in monocytes to a proinflammatory state with elevated CD36 levels, and this is associated with CD36-dependent efferocytosis in Mphis that rescues delayed transneuronal degeneration in the post-ischemic brain and promotes stroke recovery. Together, these findings provide novel insight into our mechanistic understanding of how RIC improves in post-stroke recovery.

">Acetylation of lysine 82 initiates TDP-43 nuclear loss of function by disrupting its nuclear import</a></h4>

              
                The hallmark of a spectrum of age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), is a TDP-43 proteinopathy that includes nuclear loss of function and cytoplasmic aggregation. Here, reduced proteasome activity, as naturally occurs during aging, is shown to inhibit nuclear import of TDP-43. Quantitative mass spectrometry is used to determine that TDP-43 is the protein whose nuclear localization is most perturbed upon reduction in proteasome activity, culminating in elevated cytoplasmic TDP-43. Interaction of importin-a1 with the bipartite classical nuclear localization sequence (cNLS) of TDP-43 is shown to be disrupted by partial proteasome inhibition but maintained by replacement with a PY-NLS that is recognized by importin-b2. Mechanistically, this nuclear depletion of TDP-43 is shown to be driven by ubiquitination or acetylation of lysines 79, 82, and 84 within the cNLS when proteasome activity is reduced in human neurons. Specifically, acetylation at lysine 82 is sufficient to abolish TDP-43 binding to importin-a1 and subsequent nuclear import of TDP-43. Moreover, using acetylation-specific TDP-43 antibodies, we detected acetylation of lysine 82 in the motor cortex of sporadic ALS patients but not control subjects. Our findings demonstrate that post-translational acetylation at lysine 82 of TDP-43 drives disruption of its importin-a1-mediated nuclear import and is sufficient to initiate TDP-43 nuclear loss of function and cytoplasmic accumulation, evidence supporting acetylation as a plausible initiator of TDP-43 proteinopathies.

	<p>Objective: This meta-analysis with a systematic review was undertaken to assess the association between APOE allelic genotypes and the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) in the Italian population. Methods: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched until 15 November 2023. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed and random effect models, depending on the I2 statistic value. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in agreement with the PRISMA guideline and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023492580). Results: Our meta-analysis based on 15 studies revealed a higher risk of AD among Italian individuals carrying the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele (OR = 3.60, 95% CI [2.90&amp;amp;ndash;4.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The association of AD genotype APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 1.36, 95% CI [0.76&amp;amp;ndash;2.41], p = 0.29) was not statistically significant, while APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3&amp;amp;epsilon;4 (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.95&amp;amp;ndash;3.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) has a high risk of AD development; the risk is more notably in the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype (OR = 7.08, 95% CI [4.22&amp;amp;ndash;11.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). The APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele has a protective effect (APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 (OR = 0.47, 95% CI [0.29-0-74], p = 0.0013)), and similar results were achieved by APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;3 (OR&amp;amp;thinsp; = &amp;amp;thinsp;0.49, 95% CI [0.37&amp;amp;ndash;0.65], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analysis of three areas of Italy (southern, northern, and center) revealed that that APOE&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;epsilon;4 allele was a risk factor with a higher OR in northern Italy (OR 4.22; 95% CI [3.46&amp;amp;ndash;5.16], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to southern and center Italy (OR 3.02; 95% CI [2.28&amp;amp;ndash;4.01], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.97; 95% CI [1.37&amp;amp;ndash;11.56], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). As well, APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4&amp;amp;epsilon;4 genotype carriers had a significantly higher OR in northern Italy (OR 9.69; 95% CI [4.94&amp;amp;ndash;18.99], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) compared to in southern and center Italy (OR 4.38; 95% CI [1.54&amp;amp;ndash;12.47], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and OR 3.59; 95% CI [0.87&amp;amp;ndash;14.86], p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001, respectively). Conclusions: This systematic review with a meta-analysis of the Italian population on APOE alleles, genotyping, and AD incidence, highlights that individuals harboring APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;4 have a higher risk of developing AD compared to those with other alleles. It also supports the protective effect of the APOE &amp;amp;epsilon;2 allele against the progress of AD. The qualitative analysis on the complex genetic interactions influencing Alzheimer risk emphasizes the need for further research on genetic and environmental factors for effective prevention strategies.</p>

	<p>In this narrative review, we explore the latest evidence on semantic interventions for older adults, including both prevention and rehabilitation/remediation efforts, discussing them particularly in the context of dementia. Cognitive interventions vary in their level of structure, encompassing standardized (task-focused tasks) and unstandardized tasks (person-centered tasks). These interventions also differ in their target: rehabilitation or prevention. Addressing semantic knowledge/semantic memory/semantics is important, primarily because its efficiency impacts other cognitive domains. Semantic tasks are commonly included in preventive and rehabilitation programs, typically as standardized tasks with pre-defined semantic referents. On the other hand, person-centered approaches introduce personally relevant semantics, allowing patients to share thoughts and experiences with expressive language. Although these approaches offer benefits beyond cognitive improvement, their lack of structure may pose challenges. Our question club (CQ) program blends structured activities with personally relevant semantics, aiming to harness the advantages of both methods. Additionally, in this narrative review, we discuss future challenges and directions in the field of semantic interventions.</p>

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study concludes that IPC educational modules can enhance adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices, potentially reducing the occurrence of foot ulcers and amputations, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1020/v1?src=rss">Entrepreneurial mindset assessment: a systematic literature review using PRISMA model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background An entrepreneurial mindset is widely recognized as crucial for success in today’s fast-paced competitive world. People across various sectors—businesses, schools, politics, the military, and the public— benefit from a developed entrepreneurial mindset. Consequently, an accurate entrepreneurial mind-sets is becoming increasingly vital. This systematic literature review comprehensively analyzed the research on methods used to assess entrepreneurial mindsets. This inquiry was explored in terms of the fundamental characteristics of the reviewed documents, common entrepreneurial mindset traits or skills, evidence of validity and reliability, research methods employed, study participants, focus areas, and key findings from recent studies. Methods A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework was utilized, and 39 documents published in the period 2015–2024 were extracted from the EBSCO, ERIC, and SCOPUS databases. Results Researchers from the USA dominated the field of this study. These assessment practices mainly target the educational sector, especially engineering education, where students are the primary participants. Currently, researchers are actively creating new assessment tools for entrepreneurial mind-sets tailored to students in entrepreneurial programs at engineering institutions. Most of these tools have been shown to be valid and reliable. The KEEN 3C framework is the most common assessment tool, emphasizing curiosity (CU), connections (CON), and creating value (CV). Conclusions This study makes significant contributions by compiling the existing literature on entrepreneurial mindset assessment, which presents the most up-to-date knowledge in the field. Educational institutions and business organizations can utilize the entrepreneurial mind-set assessment approaches highlighted in this review. This article is unique in that it enhances the field of entrepreneurship by presenting a new systematic literature review of entrepreneurial mindset assessment approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1273/v3?src=rss">Analytical approach to piezoelectric model synthesis with the use of Cauer’s method for system design [version 3; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Piezoceramic materials have unique property which enables direct and bilateral conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. This ability facilitates significant miniaturisation of technology and opens many opportunities in design of new actuators and energy harvesters. Mathematical modelling of piezoelectric modules is notoriously hard due to complex constitutive equations defining mechanical and electrical energy conversion. Methods The article presents research on a new synthesis method based on the Cauer’s method. Mechanical damping is introduced with the use of Rayleigh’s approximation. A discrete electromechanical model is formed based on the Mason’s piezoelectric model. The proposed approach allows modelling of piezoelectric systems based on a set of characteristic frequencies. The method allows a more general approach to the problem of modelling new systems, as opposed to application-oriented methods seen in literature. A non-standard model analysis method using edge graphs and structural numbers is also verified as a potential alternative for matrix-based method. The authors compare their precision and computation requirements. Results The structural method of mechanical model analysis gave identical results as the reference matrix method. However, the non-classical algorithm took much longer to calculate and was using more memory. The electromechanical model analysis has shown an error of 5% in comparison to resonance frequencies taken from a reference plate specification. The calculated magnitude of displacement was well above the capability of a 3.5mm thick piezoelectric plate. Conclusions The synthesis method presented in this paper allows synthesizing piezoelectric cascade models based on limited information in form of characteristic frequencies. Currently this method allows a coarse approximation of the real piezoelectric parameters with limited number of inputs. The additional method of analysis based on structural numbers offers a promising alternative to matrix calculations but requires a more thorough investigation of the computational power required to determine whether it can compete with existing algorithms.

                Abstract Background Melanoma, an aggressive malignant skin cancer, has the ability to spread both locoregionally and to distant sites. The risk of metastasis is correlated to invasion depth and the presence of ulceration. Although gastrointestinal (GI) metastases are uncommon, gastric involvement is particularly rare. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper GI endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

                Background Education for diabetes patients is not managed well by diabetes nurse educators because the competency of diabetes nurse educators is low, and the number of diabetes nurse educators in hospitals is not commensurate with the number of diabetes patients, which is much larger. Methods This qualitative phenomenological research uses an exploratory design. Twenty nurse managers and forty staff nurses who participated in the focus group discussion (FGD) were selected using purposive sampling. Nine staff nurses who participated in in-depth interviews were selected using the snowball method. The results of the FGD exploration and in-depth interviews produced components for developing an educational model with a management approach. The development of this educational model uses an input, process, output, and outcome approach. The input uses King’s conceptual framework approach, the method uses the theory of goal attainment and management functions, the output is the competency of nurses to educate diabetes patients, and the outcome is the health literacy of diabetes patients. This educational model was reviewed by three experts: a nursing management expert, a diabetes mellitus expert, and a health literacy expert. Results The educational model for Diabetes nurse educators with a management approach consists of five stages: 1) Educational planning includes identifying educational targets, strategy formulation, and situation analysis. 2) Organizing nursing resources includes strengthening the role of nurses as diabetes educators. 3) Nursing staff includes intraprofessional collaboration and collaboration between nurses and patient families. 4) Direction includes nurses’ motivation for diabetes patients and respecting the culture and values of diabetes patients. 5) Control includes evaluating nurse education for diabetes patients. Conclusion This education model has five competencies, which are structured and systematic so that diabetes nurse educators have the competence to manage diabetes patient education: the personal system, interpersonal system, and social system influence nurse competency.

                Background Muscarinic receptor agonism is a promising mechanism of action for treating psychosis, not present in most D2R-blocking antipsychotics. Xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, has shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, with more compounds being investigated. Therefore, we aim to synthesize evidence on the preclinical efficacy of muscarinic receptor agonists in animal models of psychosis to provide unique insights and evidence-based information to guide drug development. Methods We plan a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo animal studies comparing muscarinic receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators with control conditions and existing D2R-blocking antipsychotics in animals subjected to any method that induces behavioural changes of relevance for psychosis. We will identify eligible studies by searching multiple electronic databases. At least two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction using prespecified forms and assess the risk of bias with the SYRCLE’s tool. Our primary outcomes include locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition measured with standardized mean differences. We will examine other behavioural readouts of relevance for psychosis as secondary outcomes, such as social interaction and cognitive function. We will synthesize the data using multi-level meta-analysis with a predefined random-effects structure, considering the non-independence of the data. In meta-regressions we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity from a predefined list of characteristics of the animal population, model, and intervention. We will assess the confidence in the evidence considering a self-developed instrument thatconsiders the internal and external validity of the evidence.

                Background Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) frequently present with kinesiophobia. Although kinesiophobia is found to affect outcomes such as affect pain and quality of life in patients with CLBP, it is unclear whether kinesiophobia is linked to reduction of muscle endurance in these patients. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the impact of kinesiophobia on lumbar extensor endurance in patients with CLBP and asymptomatic individuals. Methods This case-control study was proceeded with 200 patients with CLBP and 400 controls. Kinesiophobia, lumbar endurance and Pain intensity were assessed with Tampa Scale, Soren’s lumbar extensor test and visual analog scale respectively. Regression model was administered to explore the relationship between kinesiophobia and lumbar extensor endurance. Results Prevalence of kinesiophobia was found to be higher in patients with CLBP (30%) than in controls (11%) which is (6.49 ± 0.52, d= 1.07) more in CLBP than controls. Lumbar endurance was significantly lower in CLBP than controls (-20.5±6.84), further affected by the presence of kinesiophobia as lumbar endurance was negatively correlated (r = - 0.09) to Kinesiophobia. Moreover, VAS (r = 0.2) was positively correlated with kinesiophobia in patients with CLBP. Discussion and conclusion A high prevalence of kinesiophobia was reported by patients with CLBP. The presence of kinesiophobia exhibited strong linear relationship with lumbar endurance, and pain intensity among patients with CLBP. Hence management of CLBP should comprise of an assessment of kinesiophobia and appropriate treatment strategies to address it in preventing persistent CLBP.

                Background Dietary habits play a significant role in health and well-being. Nutritional knowledge can influence dietary habits. This study investigated the level of nutrition knowledge and factors affecting nutrition knowledge among student migrants in the West Midlands of the United Kingdom. Method Data were collected from 372 participants using the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ). The effects of gender, length of UK residency, program and level of study, marital status, and history of diet-related diseases on nutrition knowledge were assessed. Results The students generally demonstrated good nutrition knowledge. The overall mean score was 52.3 ± 2.4, and the median score was 54. Mean scores for dietary recommendations (11.9±0.4, 348 participants), food classification (21.3±1.0, 264 participants) and diet-related diseases/weight management (13.2±0.6, 324 participants) are indicative of good nutrition knowledge. Poor knowledge of food choices was observed (5.9±0.4, 156 participants). Females, postgraduates, and married students, as well as those with ≤3 years of UK residency, had higher mean scores compared to those in the opposite groups. BMI and a history of diet-related diseases did not significantly affect nutritional knowledge. Conclusion Gender, level and type of study, marital status, and length of stay in the UK were predictors of good nutrition knowledge. Interventions to improve the knowledge of food choices among student migrants are needed.

                <p>by Eslam Abousamra, Marlin Figgins, Trevor Bedford</p>

Genomic surveillance of pathogen evolution is essential for public health response, treatment strategies, and vaccine development. In the context of SARS-COV-2, multiple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) describing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing variant <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time forecasts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy highlights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides ∼0.6% median absolute error and ∼6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term forecasts. We conclude that fitness models represent a useful prognostic tool for short-term evolutionary forecasting.

                <p>by Aakash Agrawal, Stanislas Dehaene</p>

Learning to read places a strong challenge on the visual system. Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of positions, sizes and fonts. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by recycling deep neural network models initially trained for image recognition. We retrain them to recognize written words and then analyze how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across the successive layers. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the visual word form area (VWFA) in the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their ordinal position from the left or the right of a word. The transition from retinotopic to ordinal position coding is achieved by a hierarchy of “space bigram” unit that detect the position of a letter relative to a blank space and that pool across low- and high-frequency-sensitive units from early layers of the network. The proposed scheme provides a plausible neural code for written words in the VWFA, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.

                <p>by Alia Abbara, Lisa Pagani, Celia García-Pareja, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

In nature, most microbial populations have complex spatial structures that can affect their evolution. Evolutionary graph theory predicts that some spatial structures modelled by placing individuals on the nodes of a graph affect the probability that a mutant will fix. Evolution experiments are beginning to explicitly address the impact of graph structures on mutant fixation. However, the assumptions of evolutionary graph theory differ from the conditions of modern evolution experiments, making the comparison between theory and experiment challenging. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using our new model of spatially structured populations. This model considers connected subpopulations that lie on the nodes of a graph, and allows asymmetric migrations. It can handle large populations, and explicitly models serial passage events with migrations, thus closely mimicking experimental conditions. We analyze recent experiments in light of this model. We suggest useful parameter regimes for future experiments, and we make quantitative predictions for these experiments. In particular, we propose experiments to directly test our recent prediction that the star graph with asymmetric migrations suppresses natural selection and can accelerate mutant fixation or extinction, compared to a well-mixed population.

                <p>by Breanne Sparta, Timothy Hamilton, Gunalan Natesan, Samuel D. Aragones, Eric J. Deeds</p>

Effective analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data requires a rigorous distinction between technical noise and biological variation. In this work, we propose a simple feature selection model, termed “Differentially Distributed Genes” or DDGs, where a binomial sampling process for each mRNA species produces a null model of technical variation. Using scRNA-seq data where cell identities have been established <i>a priori</i>, we find that the DDG model of biological variation outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate that DDGs distinguish a validated set of real biologically varying genes, minimize neighborhood distortion, and enable accurate partitioning of cells into their established cell-type groups.

                <p>by Joseph Shingleton, David Mustard, Steven Dyke, Hannah Williams, Emma Bennett, Thomas Finnie</p>

Reverse epidemiology is a mathematical modelling tool used to ascertain information about the source of a pathogen, given the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths. In the context of a deliberately released pathogen, such as <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> (the disease-causing organism of anthrax), this can allow responders to quickly identify the location and timing of the release, as well as other factors such as the strength of the release, and the realized wind speed and direction at release. These estimates can then be used to parameterise a predictive mechanistic model, allowing for estimation of the potential scale of the release, and to optimise the distribution of prophylaxis.
In this paper we present two novel approaches to reverse epidemiology, and demonstrate their utility in responding to a simulated deliberate release of <i>B. anthracis</i> in ten locations in the UK and compare these to the standard grid-search approach. The two methods—a modified MCMC and a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network—are able to identify the source location and timing of the release with significantly better accuracy compared to the grid-search approach. Further, the neural network method is able to do inference on new data significantly quicker than either the grid-search or novel MCMC methods, allowing for rapid deployment in time-sensitive outbreaks.

Modular organization at approximately 1 mm scale could be fundamental to cortical processing, but its presence in human association cortex is unknown. Using custom-built, high-density electrode arrays placed on the cortical surface of 7 patients undergoing awake craniotomy for tumor excision, we investigated receptive speech processing in the left (dominant) human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Responses to consonant-vowel syllables and noise-vocoded controls recorded with 1,024 channel micro-grids at 200 μm pitch demonstrated roughly circular domains approximately 1.7 mm in diameter, with sharp boundaries observed in 128 channel linear arrays at 50 μm pitch, possibly consistent with a columnar organization. Peak latencies to syllables in different modules were bimodally distributed centered at 252 and 386 ms. Adjacent modules were sharply delineated from each other by their distinct time courses and stimulus selectivity. We suggest that receptive language cortex may be organized in discrete processing modules.

                <p>by Noga Korenfeld, Tali Gorbonos, Maria C. Romero Florian, Dan Rotaro, Dana Goldberg, Talia Radushkevitz-Frishman, Meital Charni-Natan, Meirav Bar-Shimon, Carolyn L. Cummins, Ido Goldstein</p>

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90082">Using recurrent neural network to estimate irreducible stochasticity in human choice behavior</a></h4>

              
                Theoretical computational models are widely used to describe latent cognitive processes. However, these models do not equally explain data across participants, with some individuals showing a bigger predictive gap than others. In the current study, we examined the use of theory-independent models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to classify the source of a predictive gap in the observed data of a single individual. This approach aims to identify whether the low predictability of behavioral data is mainly due to noisy decision-making or misspecification of the theoretical model. First, we used computer simulation in the context of reinforcement learning to demonstrate that RNNs can be used to identify model misspecification in simulated agents with varying degrees of behavioral noise. Specifically, both prediction performance and the number of RNN training epochs (i.e., the point of early stopping) can be used to estimate the amount of stochasticity in the data. Second, we applied our approach to an empirical dataset where the actions of low IQ participants, compared with high IQ participants, showed lower predictability by a well-known theoretical model (i.e., Daw’s hybrid model for the two-step task). Both the predictive gap and the point of early stopping of the RNN suggested that model misspecification is similar across individuals. This led us to a provisional conclusion that low IQ subjects are mostly noisier compared to their high IQ peers, rather than being more misspecified by the theoretical model. We discuss the implications and limitations of this approach, considering the growing literature in both theoretical and data-driven computational modeling in decision-making science.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92545">The function of juvenile–adult transition axis in female sexual receptivity of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Female sexual receptivity is essential for reproduction of a species. Neuropeptides play the main role in regulating female receptivity. However, whether neuropeptides regulate female sexual receptivity during the neurodevelopment is unknown. Here, we found the peptide hormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which belongs to the insect PG (prothoracic gland) axis, negatively regulated virgin female receptivity through ecdysone during neurodevelopment in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We identified PTTH neurons as doublesex-positive neurons, they regulated virgin female receptivity before the metamorphosis during the third-instar larval stage. PTTH deletion resulted in the increased EcR-A expression in the whole newly formed prepupae. Furthermore, the ecdysone receptor EcR-A in pC1 neurons positively regulated virgin female receptivity during metamorphosis. The decreased EcR-A in pC1 neurons induced abnormal morphological development of pC1 neurons without changing neural activity. Among all subtypes of pC1 neurons, the function of EcR-A in pC1b neurons was necessary for virgin female copulation rate. These suggested that the changes of synaptic connections between pC1b and other neurons decreased female copulation rate. Moreover, female receptivity significantly decreased when the expression of PTTH receptor Torso was reduced in pC1 neurons. This suggested that PTTH not only regulates female receptivity through ecdysone but also through affecting female receptivity associated neurons directly. The PG axis has similar functional strategy as the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in mammals to trigger the juvenile–adult transition. Our work suggests a general mechanism underlying which the neurodevelopment during maturation regulates female sexual receptivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87335">The protein domains of vertebrate species in which selection is more effective have greater intrinsic structural disorder</a></h4>

              
                The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both this minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged, and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an ‘effective population size’ is often estimated from the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and is assumed to also capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. A potentially more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics that compare codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95494">ImmCellTyper facilitates systematic mass cytometry data analysis for deep immune profiling</a></h4>

              
                Mass cytometry is a cutting-edge high-dimensional technology for profiling marker expression at the single-cell level, advancing clinical research in immune monitoring. Nevertheless, the vast data generated by cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) poses a significant analytical challenge. To address this, we describe ImmCellTyper (<a href="https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper">https://github.com/JingAnyaSun/ImmCellTyper</a>), a novel toolkit for CyTOF data analysis. This framework incorporates BinaryClust, an in-house developed semi-supervised clustering tool that automatically identifies main cell types. BinaryClust outperforms existing clustering tools in accuracy and speed, as shown in benchmarks with two datasets of approximately 4 million cells, matching the precision of manual gating by human experts. Furthermore, ImmCellTyper offers various visualisation and analytical tools, spanning from quality control to differential analysis, tailored to users’ specific needs for a comprehensive CyTOF data analysis solution. The workflow includes five key steps: (1) batch effect evaluation and correction, (2) data quality control and pre-processing, (3) main cell lineage characterisation and quantification, (4) in-depth investigation of specific cell types; and (5) differential analysis of cell abundance and functional marker expression across study groups. Overall, ImmCellTyper combines expert biological knowledge in a semi-supervised approach to accurately deconvolute well-defined main cell lineages, while maintaining the potential of unsupervised methods to discover novel cell subsets, thus facilitating high-dimensional immune profiling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99702">Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</a></h4>

              
                Small-molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2’s strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2-based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Induced Fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model-based small-molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different mammalian protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here, we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92135">Early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal diet impact offspring DNA methylation across species</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol consumption in pregnancy can affect genome regulation in the developing offspring but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93146">Reversions mask the contribution of adaptive evolution in microbiomes</a></h4>

              
                When examining bacterial genomes for evidence of past selection, the results depend heavily on the mutational distance between chosen genomes. Even within a bacterial species, genomes separated by larger mutational distances exhibit stronger evidence of purifying selection as assessed by d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>, the normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. Here, we show that the classical interpretation of this scale dependence, weak purifying selection, leads to problematic mutation accumulation when applied to available gut microbiome data. We propose an alternative, adaptive reversion model with opposite implications for dynamical intuition and applications of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub>. Reversions that occur and sweep within-host populations are nearly guaranteed in microbiomes due to large population sizes, short generation times, and variable environments. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we show that adaptive reversion can explain the d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> decay given only dozens of locally fluctuating selective pressures, which is realistic in the context of <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes. The success of the adaptive reversion model argues for interpreting low values of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>S</sub> obtained from long timescales with caution as they may emerge even when adaptive sweeps are frequent. Our work thus inverts the interpretation of an old observation in bacterial evolution, illustrates the potential of mutational reversions to shape genomic landscapes over time, and highlights the importance of studying bacterial genomic evolution on short timescales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91605">Novel cyclic homogeneous oscillation detection method for high accuracy and specific characterization of neural dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Determining the presence and frequency of neural oscillations is essential to understanding dynamic brain function. Traditional methods that detect peaks over 1/<i>f</i> noise within the power spectrum fail to distinguish between the fundamental frequency and harmonics of often highly non-sinusoidal neural oscillations. To overcome this limitation, we define fundamental criteria that characterize neural oscillations and introduce the cyclic homogeneous oscillation (CHO) detection method. We implemented these criteria based on an autocorrelation approach to determine an oscillation’s fundamental frequency. We evaluated CHO by verifying its performance on simulated non-sinusoidal oscillatory bursts and validated its ability to determine the fundamental frequency of neural oscillations in electrocorticographic (ECoG), electroencephalographic (EEG), and stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recorded from 27 human subjects. Our results demonstrate that CHO outperforms conventional techniques in accurately detecting oscillations. In summary, CHO demonstrates high precision and specificity in detecting neural oscillations in time and frequency domains. The method’s specificity enables the detailed study of non-sinusoidal characteristics of oscillations, such as the degree of asymmetry and waveform of an oscillation. Furthermore, CHO can be applied to identify how neural oscillations govern interactions throughout the brain and to determine oscillatory biomarkers that index abnormal brain function.

">ABBA, a novel tool for whole-brain mapping, reveals brain-wide differences in immediate early genes induction following learning</a></h4>

              
                Unbiased characterization of whole-brain cytoarchitecture represents an invaluable tool for understanding brain function. For this, precise mapping of histological markers from 2D sections onto 3D brain atlases is pivotal. Here, we present two novel software tools facilitating this process: Aligning Big Brains and Atlases (ABBA), designed to streamline the precise and efficient registration of 2D sections to 3D reference atlases, and BraiAn, an integrated suite for multi-marker automated segmentation, whole-brain statistical analysis, and data visualisation. Combining these tools, we performed a comprehensive comparative study of the whole-brain expression of three of the most widely used immediate early genes (IEGs). Thanks to their neural activity-dependent expression, IEGs have been used for decades as a proxy of neural activity to generate unbiased mapping of activity following behaviour, but their respective induction in response to neuronal activation across the entire brain remains unclear. To address this question, we systematically compared the brain-wide expression cFos, Arc and NPAS4, three abundantly used IEGs, across three different behavioural conditions related to memory. Our results highlight major differences in both their distribution and induction patterns, indicating that they do not represent equivalent markers across brain areas or activity states, but can provide instead complementary information.

">Fast and slow synaptic plasticity enables concurrent control and learning</a></h4>

              
                During many tasks the brain receives real-time feedback about performance. What should it do with that information, at the synaptic level, so that tasks can be performed as well as possible? The conventional answer is that it should learn by incrementally adjusting synaptic strengths. We show, however, that learning on its own is severely suboptimal. To maximize performance, synaptic plasticity should also operate on a much faster timescale -- essentially, the synaptic weights should act as a control signal. We propose a normative plasticity rule that embodies this principle. In this, fast synaptic weight changes greedily suppress downstream errors, while slow synaptic weight changes implement statistically optimal learning. This enables near-perfect task performance immediately, efficient task execution on longer timescales, and confers robustness to noise and other perturbations. Applied in a cerebellar microcircuit model, the theory explains longstanding experimental observations and makes novel testable predictions.

                Interoceptive signals dynamically interact with the environment to shape appropriate defensive behaviors. Hypothalamic hormones arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) regulate physiological states, including water and electrolyte balance, circadian rhythmicity, and defensive behaviors. Both AVP and OT neurons project to dorsolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNSTDL), which expresses oxytocin receptors (OTRs) and vasopressin receptors and mediates fear responses. However, understanding the integrated role of neurohypophysial hormones is complicated by the cross-reactivity of AVP and OT and their mutual receptor promiscuity. Here, we provide evidence that the effects of neurohypophysial hormones on BNSTDL excitability are driven by input specificity and cell type-specific receptor selectivity. We show that OTR-expressing BNSTDL neurons, excited by hypothalamic OT and AVP inputs, play a major role in regulating BNSTDL excitability, overcoming threat avoidance, and reducing threat-elicited anxious arousal. Therefore, OTR-BNSTDL neurons are perfectly suited to drive the dynamic interactions balancing external threat risk and physiological needs.

">A hippocampal astrocytic sequence emerges during learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal hippocampus is a heterogeneous structure with numerous cell types involved in generating and maintaining detailed representations of space and time. Prior work has established that pyramidal cells contribute to these crucial aspects of episodic memory. For example, hippocampal "time cells" encode temporal information through sequential activity. However, the role of non-neuronal cell types are less often explored. In this study, we investigated dorsal hippocampal CA1 astrocytes using one-photon calcium imaging in freely moving animals during a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. To our knowledge, this is the first time a study has successfully performed longitudinal registration of astrocytic cell population using 1p calcium imaging, thus permitting the tracking of a stable population of these cells in freely-moving mice. In response to foot shock, astrocytes generated robust calcium-event sequences with a time-compressed structure akin to canonical hippocampal time cells. Upon re-exposure to the conditioned context, these astrocytic sequences persisted in the absence of shock, maintaining their time-compressed structure. Moreover, astrocytes active on the previous day retained a preserved sequential structure, indicating memory-specific properties. This phenomenon was not observed in a context different from the initial fear conditioning chamber. Taken together, these results present a potentially paradigm-shifting notion that astrocytes play a significant role in the representation of temporal information processing across learning and memory.

">Electrophysiological responses reveal a dedicated learning mechanism to process salient consonant sounds in human newborns</a></h4>

              
                Isolating relevant sounds in the auditory stream is a crucial feature accomplished by human infants and a pivotal ability for language acquisition. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate the existence of early mechanisms reorienting attention toward salient acoustic stimuli. Previous studies suggest that infants consider consonant sounds as more salient than dissonant ones, because the former resemble human vocalizations. However, systematic evidence investigating the neural processes underlying consonance tuning in newborns is still scarce. Here, we investigate newborns' ability to recognize and learn salient auditory stimuli by collecting Mismatch Responses (MMRs) to consonant and dissonant sounds and by computing the trial-by-trial correlation of the neural signal with Bayesian Surprise (a theoretical measure of learning). We present 22 healthy newborns (40.4 {+/-} 15.8 hours) with a pseudo-random sequence of deviant and standard auditory events, while we record their electroencephalogram. Our results show that newborns exhibit a neural encoding of auditory regularities for all sound types (consonant and dissonant), as demonstrated by the presence of MMRs and significant correlation of the neural signal with Bayesian Surprise. Furthermore, consonant and dissonant sounds elicited MMRs and correlations with Bayesian Surprise of opposite polarities, with consonant auditory stimulation evoking negative responses, reminiscent of an adult-like MMR. Overall, our findings suggest that newborns display a dedicated perceptual learning mechanism for salient consonant sounds. We speculate that this mechanism might represent an evolutionary-achieved neural tuning to detect and learn salient auditory stimuli with acoustic features resembling human vocalizations.

">Endocytic BDNF secretion through extracellular vesicle-dependent secretory pathways in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an essential role in regulating diverse neuronal functions in an activity-dependent manner. Although BDNF is synthesized primarily in neurons, astrocytes can also supply BDNF through various routes, including the recycling of neuron-derived BDNF. Despite accumulating evidence for astrocytic BDNF uptake and resecretion of neuronal BDNF, the detailed mechanisms underlying astrocytic BDNF recycling remain unclear. Here, we report that astrocytic resecretion of endocytosed BDNF is mediated by an extracellular vesicle (EV)-dependent secretory pathway. In cultured primary astrocytes, extracellular BDNF was endocytosed into CD63-positive EVs, and stimulation of astrocytes with ATP could evoke the release of endocytosed BDNF from CD63-positive vesicles. Downregulation of vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (Vamp3) led to an increase in the colocalization of endosomal BDNF and CD63 but a decrease in extracellular vesicle release, suggesting the necessity of Vamp3-dependent signaling for EV-mediated BDNF secretion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that astrocytic recycling of neuronal BDNF is dependent on the EV-mediated secretory pathway via Vamp3-associated signaling.

                Untangling the hippocampus connectivity is critical for understanding the mechanisms supporting learning and memory. However, the function of interhemispheric connections between hippocampal formations is still poorly understood. So far, two major hippocampal commissural projections have been characterized in rodents. Mossy cells from the hilus of the dentate gyrus project to the inner molecular layer of the contralateral dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA2 pyramidal neuron axonal collaterals to contralateral CA3, CA2 and CA1. In contrary, little is known about commissural projection from the CA1 region. Here, we show that CA1 pyramidal neurons from the dorsal hippocampus project to contralateral dorsal CA1 as well as dorsal subiculum. We further demonstrate that the interhemispheric projection from CA1 to dorsal subiculum supports spatial memory and spatial working memory in WT mice, two cognitive functions impaired in male mice from the Df16(A)+/- model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) associated with schizophrenia. Investigation of the CA1 interhemispheric projections in Df16(A)+/- mice revealed that these projections are disrupted with male mutants showing stronger anatomical defects compared to females. Overall, our results characterize a novel interhemispheric projection from dCA1 to dorsal subiculum and suggest that dysregulation of this projection may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with the 22q11.2DS.

">DNMT1-Mediated Regulation of Inhibitory Interneuron Migration Impacts Cortical Architecture and Function</a></h4>

              
                The fine-tuned establishment of neuronal circuits during the formation of the cerebral cortex is pivotal for its functionality. Developmental abnormalities affecting the composition of cortical circuits, which consist of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons, are linked to a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. Excitatory neurons originate in cortical proliferative zones, while inhibitory interneurons migrate from discrete domains of the basal telencephalon into the cortex. This migration is intricately governed by intrinsic genetic programs and extrinsic cues. Our current study reveals the role of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in controlling expression of key genes implicated in mouse cortical interneuron development and in guiding the migration of somatostatin-expressing interneurons within the developing cortex. Dnmt1 deletion causes interneurons to exit prematurely from the superficial migratory stream. In addition to the perturbed migration pattern and altered gene expression signatures, Dnmt1-deficient interneurons had a discernible non-cell autonomous effect on cortical progenitors, which culminated in nuanced alterations of layer thicknesses in the adult cortex. Our study reveals that an epigenetic mechanism governs the migration of cortical interneurons and through this, their instructive role in sculpting the intricate cortical layer architecture by signaling to cortical progenitors, with pronounced effects on cortical network function.

">Adiponectin signaling modulates fat taste responsiveness in mice</a></h4>

              
                We previously reported that the adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon selectively enhances cellular responses to fatty acids in a human taste cell line. The enhancement role of AdipoRon on fatty acid-induced cell responses is mediated by the activation of AMPK and translocation of CD36 on human taste cells. It has also been shown that adiponectin selectively increases taste behavioral responses to intralipid in mice. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the physiological effects of adiponectin on fat taste in mice remains unclear. Here we define AdipoR1 as the mediator responsible for the enhancement role of adiponectin/AdipoRon on fatty acid-induced responses in mouse taste bud cells. Calcium imaging data demonstrate that AdipoRon enhances linoleic acid-induced calcium responses in a dose-dependent fashion in mouse taste cells isolated from circumvallate and fungiform papillae. Similar to the human taste cells, the enhancement role of AdipoRon on fatty acid-induced responses was impaired by the co-administration of an AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) or a CD36 inhibitor (SSO). Utilizing Adipor1-deficient animals we determined the enhancement role of AdipoRon/adiponectin is dependent on AdipoR1 since AdipoRon/adiponectin failed to increase fatty acid-induced calcium responses in taste bud cells isolated from these mice. Brief-access taste tests were performed to determine whether AdipoRon's enhancement role was correlated with any differences in taste behavioral responses to fat. Although AdipoRon enhances the cellular responses of taste bud cells to fatty acids, it does not appear to alter fat taste behavior in mice. However, fat naive Adipor1-/- animals were indifferent to increasing concentrations of intralipid, suggesting that adiponectin signaling may have profound effects on the ability of mice to detect fatty acids in the absence of previous exposure to fatty acids and fat-containing diets.

">Motor learning is regulated by GDNF levels in postnatal cerebellar Purkinje cells</a></h4>

              
                Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are crucial for cerebellum-dependent motor learning. Previously we demonstrated that a ubiquitous 2-3-fold increase of endogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) improves motor learning. However, GDNF impacts many organ systems and cell types throughout the body leaving the underlying mechanism elusive. Here, we utilize an innovative conditional GDNF Hypermorphic mouse model to show that a 2-fold increase in endogenous GDNF specifically in postnatal Purkinje cells (PCs) is sufficient to enhance motor learning in adult animals. We demonstrate that improved motor learning is associated with increased glutamatergic input to PCs and elevated spontaneous firing rate of these cells, opposite to cerebellar ataxia where reduction in motor function and learning associates with decreased spontaneous activity of PCs. Notably, the GDNF expression levels variation range studied in our mouse model's cerebellum falls within the normal range of variation observed in healthy human cerebellums. Our findings uncover a molecular pathway and a specific cell type that regulate motor learning, potentially explaining some individual differences in human motor skill acquisition.

">Neuropathic pain and distinct CASPR2 autoantibody IgG subclasses drive neuronal hyperexcitability</a></h4>

              
                Patients with autoantibodies (aAbs) against the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) suffer from a variety of clinical syndromes including neuropathic pain, in some patients even as the only symptom. CASPR2 is an adhesion protein of the neurexin IV family and part of the voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKC) in neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The subsequent pathological mechanisms following the binding of CASPR2 aAbs and their association with pain are only partially understood. CASPR2 aAbs are mainly of the IgG4 subclass. Previous studies have neglected subclass- dependent effects. Here we investigated 49 subclassified patient serum samples positive for CASPR2 aAbs. To unravel underlying molecular mechanisms, we used a combination of super-resolution lattice structural illumination microscopy (SIM2) and functional readouts by calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings. CASPR2-positive patient sera subclassified in IgG4 together with at least one other IgG subclass (IgGX) and patients with only IgG4 were further subdivided into the pain and no pain group. Patient subclassification shed further light on the pathological mechanisms of CASPR2 aAbs. A decrease of CASPR2 expression after long-term exposure to CASPR2 aAbs was only observed for the patient group without pain. Upon withdrawal of the CASPR2 aAbs, CASPR2 expression returned to normal level. Structural alterations were obtained by increased distances between CASPR2 and associated potassium channels along DRG axons using high-resolution lattice SIM2 microscopy but only following binding of CASPR2 aAbs from patients with pain. Similarly, CASPR2 aAbs of patients with pain significantly increased overall neuronal excitability of cultured DRG neurons as measured by calcium imaging. Patch-clamp recordings revealed significantly decreased current amplitudes of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels after incubation with all four CASPR2 aAbs subclassifications with the most prominent effect of serum samples harboring IgG4 aAbs. Notably, a patient serum sample lacking IgG4 did not alter Kv channel function. Withdrawal of aAbs rescued Kv channel function to normal levels suggesting that the affected potassium channel function is rather due to a functional block of the VGKC rather than altered structural integrity of the VGKC. Taken together, we found IgG4 aAbs to be a major modifier of potassium channel function. The increase in DRG excitability is primarily due to impaired Kv channel conductance as a consequence of CASPR2 aAbs binding but additional and so far unidentified signal pathways contribute to this process in patients with neuropathic pain.

">Functional Roles of Sensorimotor Alpha and Beta Oscillations in Overt Speech Production</a></h4>

              
                Power decreases, or desynchronization, of sensorimotor alpha and beta oscillations (i.e., alpha and beta ERD) have long been considered as indices of sensorimotor control in overt speech production. However, their specific functional roles are not well understood. Hence, we first conducted a systematic review to investigate how these two oscillations are modulated by speech motor tasks in typically fluent speakers (TFS) and in persons who stutter (PWS). Eleven EEG/MEG papers with source localization were included in our systematic review. The results revealed consistent alpha and beta ERD in the sensorimotor cortex of TFS and PWS. Furthermore, the results suggested that sensorimotor alpha and beta ERD may be functionally dissociable, with alpha related to (somato-)sensory feedback processing during articulation and beta related to motor processes throughout planning and articulation. To (partly) test this hypothesis of a potential functional dissociation between alpha and beta ERD, we then analyzed existing intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of picture naming. We found moderate evidence for alpha, but not beta, ERD's sensitivity to speech movements in S1, lending supporting evidence for the functional dissociation hypothesis identified by the systematic review.

">Widespread Associations between Behavioral Metrics and Brain Microstructure in ASD</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and repetitive behaviors. A diagnosis of ASD is provided by a clinician following cognitive and behavioral evaluations, but there is currently no biomarker associating these metrics with neurological changes. Our lab has previously found that g-ratio, the proportion of axon width to myelin diameter, and axonal conduction velocity, which is associated with the capacity of an axon to carry information, are both decreased in ASD individuals. By associating these differences with performance on cognitive and behavioral tests, we can evaluate which tests most reveal changes in the brain. Analyzing 273 participants (148 with ASD) ages 8-to-17 (49% female) through an NIH-sponsored Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) network (Grant#: MH100028), we observe widespread associations between behavioral and cognitive evaluations of autism and between behavioral and microstructural metrics. Analyzing data from all participants, conduction velocity but not g-ratio was significantly associated with many behavioral metrics. However, this pattern was reversed when looking solely at ASD participants. This reversal may suggest that the mechanism underlying differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals may be distinct from the mechanism underlying ASD behavioral severity. Two additional machine learning cluster analyses applied to neuroimaging data reinforce the association between neuroimaging and behavioral metrics and suggest that age-related maturation of brain metrics may drive changes in ASD behavior. By associating neuroimaging metrics with ASD, it may be possible to measure and identify individuals at high risk of ASD before behavioral tests can detect them. Significance Statement: This study establishes numerous relationships between multiple behavioral, language, and social metrics in ASD. Subsequently, this study is the first to then show associations between diffusion microstructure and subscales of behavioral assessments. Limited associations of these behaviors with conduction velocity may indicate that axonal diameter is a predominating factor in characterizing ASD over other metrics, such as myelination, however within ASD subjects the g-ratio is more closely related to behavioral metrics, suggesting a potential role for myelination in ASD severity. These findings suggest that some subscales and metrics more accurately capture behaviors associated neurologically with ASD than others, including composite scores, demonstrating the potential to identify children at high risk for ASD at an earlier age.

	<p>A major scientific objective of cognitive neuroscience is to define cortico-cortical functional connections supporting cognitive functions. Here, we use an original approach combining frequency-tagging and direct electrical stimulation (DES) to test for bidirectional and cross-hemispheric category-specific modulations within the human cortical face network. A unique patient bilaterally implanted with depth electrodes in multiple face-selective cortical regions of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) was shown 70 s sequences of variable natural object images at a 6 Hz rate, objectively identifying deviant face-selective neural activity at 1.2 Hz (i.e., every five images). Concurrent electrical stimulation was separately applied for 10 seconds on four independently defined face-selective sites in the right and left VOTC. Upon stimulation, we observed reduced or even abolished face-selective neural activity locally and, most interestingly, at distant VOTC recording sites. Remote DES effects were found up to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in both forward and backward directions along the VOTC, as well as across the two hemispheres. This reduction was specific to face-selective neural activity, with the general 6 Hz visual response being mostly unaffected. Overall, these results shed light on the functional connectivity of the cortical face-selective network, supporting its non-hierarchical organization as well as bidirectional effective category-selective connections between posterior &amp;amp;lsquo;core&amp;amp;rsquo; regions and the ATL. They also pave the way for widespread and systematic development of this approach to better understand the functional and effective connectivity of human brain networks.</p>

	<p>Medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor primarily affecting children, poses significant challenges to patients and clinicians due to its complex treatment and potential long-term cognitive consequences. While recent advancements in treatment have significantly improved survival rates, survivors often face cognitive impairments, particularly in reading, impacting their quality of life. According to the double deficit theory, reading impairments are caused by deficits in one or both of two independent reading-related functions: phonological awareness and rapid visual naming. This longitudinal study investigates neurofunctional changes related to reading in medulloblastoma survivors in comparison to controls using functional MRI acquired during rapid automatized naming tasks over three annual visits. Support vector machine classification of functional MRI data reveals a progressive divergence in brain activity patterns between medulloblastoma survivors and healthy controls over time, suggesting delayed effects of cancer treatment on brain function. Alterations in brain regions involved in visual processing and orthographic recognition during rapid naming tasks imply disruptions in the ventral visual pathway associated with normal orthographic processing. These alterations are correlated with performance in tasks involving sound awareness, reading fluency, and word attack. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of post-treatment neurofunctional alterations and the importance of early identification and intervention to address cognitive deficits in survivors.</p>

	<p>Members of three generations of a Norwegian family (N = 9) with a rare demyelinating disease were studied. Neuropsychological testing was performed using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R). EEGs were recorded with grand averaging spectrograms and event-related potentials (ERPs) in rest and cued GO/NOGO task conditions. The results were within the normal range on the MMSE. Full-scale WAIS-III results were in the range of 69&amp;amp;ndash;113, with lower scores in verbal understanding than in perceptual organization, and low scores also in indications of working memory and processing speed difficulties. The HVLT-R showed impairment of both immediate and delayed recall. Quantitative EEG showed an increase in low alpha (around 7.5 Hz) activity in the temporofrontal areas, mostly on the left side. There was a deviation in the late (&amp;amp;gt;300 ms) component in response to the NOGO stimuli. A strong correlation (r = 0.78, p = 0.01) between the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (delayed recall) and the amplitude of the NOGO ERP component was observed. The EEG spectra showed deviations from the healthy controls, especially at frontotemporal deviations. Deviations in the ERP component of the NOGO trials were related to delayed recall in the Hopkins Verbal learning test.</p>

	<p>Gonadal steroids exert different effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as preserving neuronal function and promoting neuronal survival. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone reduce neuronal loss in the CNS in animal models of neurodegeneration. However, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with higher rates of endometrial, prostate, and breast cancer. Tibolone (TIB), the metabolites of which show estrogenic and progestogenic effects, is an alternative to reduce this risk. However, the impact of TIB on memory and learning, as well as on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) levels in the hippocampus of aging males, is unknown. We administered TIB to aged C57BL/6J male mice at different doses (0.01 or 1.0 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks) and evaluated its effects on memory and learning and the content of ChAT and TPH. We assessed memory and learning with object recognition and elevated T-maze tasks. Additionally, we determined ChAT and TPH protein levels in the hippocampus by Western blotting. TIB administration increased the percentage of time spent on the novel object in the object recognition task. In addition, the latency of leaving the enclosed arm increased in both TIB groups, suggesting an improvement in fear-based learning. We also observed decreased ChAT content in the group treated with the 0.01 mg/kg TIB dose. In the case of TPH, no changes were observed with either TIB dose. These results show that long-term TIB administration improves memory without affecting locomotor activity and modulates cholinergic but not serotonergic systems in the hippocampus of aged male mice.</p>

	<p>Extensive research has shed light on the cellular and functional underpinnings of higher cognition as influenced by the prefrontal cortex. Neurotransmitters act as key regulatory molecules within the PFC to assist with synchronizing cognitive state and arousal levels. The monoamine family of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, play multifaceted roles in the cognitive processes behind learning and memory. The present review explores the organization and signaling patterns of monoamines within the PFC, as well as elucidates the numerous roles played by monoamines in learning and higher cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Tai Chi (TC) practice has been shown to improve both cognitive and physical function in older adults. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the benefits of TC remain unclear. Our primary aims are to explore whether distinct age-related and TC-practice-related relationships can be identified with respect to either temporal or spatial (within/between-network connectivity) differences. This cross-sectional study examined recurrent neural network dynamics, employing an adaptive, data-driven thresholding approach to source-localized resting-state EEG data in order to identify meaningful connections across time-varying graphs, using both temporal and spatial features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests assessed between-group differences in temporal and spatial features by age and TC practice using either healthy younger adult controls (YACs, n = 15), healthy older adult controls (OACs, n = 15), or Tai Chi older adult practitioners (TCOAs, n = 15). Our results showed that aging is associated with decreased within-network and between-network functional connectivity (FC) across most brain networks. Conversely, TC practice appears to mitigate these age-related declines, showing increased FC within and between networks in older adults who practice TC compared to non-practicing older adults. These findings suggest that TC practice may abate age-related declines in neural network efficiency and stability, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention for promoting healthy brain aging. This study furthers the triple-network model, showing that a balancing and reorientation of attention might be engaged not only through higher-order and top-down mechanisms (i.e., FPN/DAN) but also via the coupling of bottom-up, sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor (i.e., SMN/VIN) networks.</p>

                <p>Musicians can have better abilities to understand speech in adverse condition such as background noise than non-musicians. However, the neural mechanisms behind such enhanced behavioral performances remain largely unclear. Studies have found that the subcortical frequency-following response to the fundamental frequency of speech and its higher harmonics (speech-FFR) may be involved since it is larger in people with musical training than in those without. Recent research has shown that the speech-FFR consists of a cortical contribution in addition to the subcortical sources. Both the subcortical and the cortical contribution are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing speakers. However, it is unknown whether the strength of the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR, or its attention modulation, is influenced by musical training. Here we investigate these issues through magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of 52 subjects (18 musicians, 25 non-musicians, and 9 neutral participants) listening to two competing male speakers while selectively attending one of them. The speech-in-noise comprehension abilities of the participants were not assessed. We find that musicians and non-musicians display comparable cortical speech-FFRs and additionally exhibit similar subject-to-subject variability in the response. Furthermore, we also do not observe a difference in the modulation of the neural response through selective attention between musicians and non-musicians. Moreover, when assessing whether the cortical speech-FFRs are influenced by particular aspects of musical training, no significant effects emerged. Taken together, we did not find any effect of musical training on the cortical speech-FFR.</p>

                Background Tonsillectomy is among the standard procedures performed on the head and neck. Acute pain following tonsillectomy impairs recovery and contributes to physical discomfort. Adequate pharmacological management of post-operative pain increases the satisfaction and well-being of a patient. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacological management of acute pain post-tonsillectomy in the otorhinolaryngology department at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out among 72 patients. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from selected patients who underwent cold tonsillectomy. Postoperative pain assessment was conducted at six, 12, and 18 hours from initiation of pharmacological management following tonsillectomy. An interviewer-administered numerical rating scale was used for assessing postoperative pain scores. Results A total of 72 patients were enrolled, of which most were female (73.6%). The majority of patients were in the age group of 8–15 years (50%). Paracetamol was the commonest analgesia prescribed (37.5%) post-tonsillectomy. The majority of patients experienced moderate pain at six- and 12-hours following tonsillectomy, 55.6% and 65.3%, respectively, whereas 88.9% of patients had mild pain at 18 hours after initial analgesic administration. Pain relief was attained by all patients aged 16–23 years (96.6%), all being female patients, and these differences were statistically insignificant. Paracetamol achieved pain reduction from moderate pain (59.3%) and severe pain (37.0%) at six hours to mild pain at 18 hours (88.9%). Conclusions Paracetamol was the commonly prescribed analgesic following tonsillectomy with majority of patients attaining moderate pain; however, there was no significant difference between the use of combined drugs and single drug use. This could be influenced by the sample size of the studied population and individual variations in pain perception.

                Background Digital elevation models (DEMs) are important in many fields, such as geomatics and water conservation in mountainous areas. Geomorphic feature lines are necessary for topography interpolation and computation from DEMs. Methods Instead of a parameter space, we propose a novel automatic extraction of geomorphic feature lines in the feature space from discrete airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data by the tensor voting method (TVM), which was originally developed for image data. A tensor field for discrete airborne LiDAR points was first established, and then, utilizing the TVM, a new geometric feature metric of data, the line feature strength, was captured. A practical line-growing method based on the local maxima line feature strength is proposed in this study. Results Compared with general line growing, which is based on a certain threshold, our line growing method is quite effective, particularly for the extraction of primary and minor ridge and valley lines in mountainous areas. Conclusions The method presented in this paper is fast and automated, and can furnish operators with a wealth of detailed information about minor line features. This enables the extraction of ridge and valley lines that are tailored to specific requirements. Undoubtedly, the method developed here can be generalized to a large amount of LiDAR data.

                SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1, otherwise known as SMOC-1, is a secreted glycoprotein involved in various cell biological processes including cell-matrix interactions, osteoblast differentiation, embryonic development, and homeostasis. SMOC-1 was found to be elevated in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient cortex as well as being enriched in amyloid plaques and in AD patientcerebrospinal fluid, arguing for SMOC-1 as a promising biomarker for AD. Having access to high-quality SMOC-1 antibodies is crucial for the scientific community. It can ensure the consistency and reliability of SMOC-1 research, and further the exploration of its potential as both a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker.. In this study, we characterized seven SMOC-1 commercial antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified successful antibodies in the tested applications and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

                Background Dendritic spines are tiny protrusions found along the dendrites of neurons, and their number is a measure of the density of synaptic connections. Altered density and morphology is observed in several pathologies, and spine formation as well as morphological changes correlate with learning and memory. The detection of spines in microscopy images and the analysis of their morphology is therefore a prerequisite for many studies. We have developed a new open-source, freely available, plugin for ImageJ/FIJI, called Spot Spine, that allows detection and morphological measurements of spines in three dimensional images. Method Local maxima are detected in spine heads, and the intensity distribution around the local maximum is computed to perform the segmentation of each spine head. Spine necks are then traced from the spine head to the dendrite. Several parameters can be set to optimize detection and segmentation, and manual correction gives further control over the result of the process. Results The plugin allows the analysis of images of dendrites obtained with various labeling and imaging methods. Quantitative measurements are retrieved including spine head volume and surface, and neck length. Conclusion The plugin and instructions for use are available at https://imagej.net/plugins/spot-spine.

                <p>by Kirstin I. Oliveira Roster, Stephen M. Kissler, Enoma Omoregie, Jade C. Wang, Helly Amin, Steve Di Lonardo, Scott Hughes, Yonatan H. Grad</p>

Surveillance systems that monitor pathogen genome sequences are critical for rapidly detecting the introduction and emergence of pathogen variants. To evaluate how interactions between surveillance capacity, variant properties, and the epidemiological context influence the timeliness of pathogen variant detection, we developed a geographically explicit stochastic compartmental model to simulate the transmission of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant in New York City. We measured the impact of (1) testing and sequencing volume, (2) geographic targeting of testing, (3) the timing and location of variant emergence, and (4) the relative variant transmissibility on detection speed and on the undetected disease burden. Improvements in detection times and reduction of undetected infections were driven primarily by increases in the number of sequenced samples. The relative transmissibility of the new variant and the epidemic context of variant emergence also influenced detection times, showing that individual surveillance strategies can result in a wide range of detection outcomes, depending on the underlying dynamics of the circulating variants. These findings help contextualize the design, interpretation, and trade-offs of genomic surveillance strategies of pandemic respiratory pathogens.

Spatial transcriptome technology can parse transcriptomic data at the spatial level to detect high-throughput gene expression and preserve information regarding the spatial structure of tissues. Identifying spatial domains, that is identifying regions with similarities in gene expression and histology, is the most basic and critical aspect of spatial transcriptome data analysis. Most current methods identify spatial domains only through a single view, which may obscure certain important information and thus fail to make full use of the information embedded in spatial transcriptome data. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised clustering framework based on multiview graph convolutional networks (MVST) to achieve accurate spatial domain recognition by the learning graph embedding features of neighborhood graphs constructed from gene expression information, spatial location information, and histopathological image information through multiview graph convolutional networks. By exploring spatial transcriptomes from multiple views, MVST enables data from all parts of the spatial transcriptome to be comprehensively and fully utilized to obtain more accurate spatial expression patterns. We verified the effectiveness of MVST on real spatial transcriptome datasets, the robustness of MVST on some simulated datasets, and the reasonableness of the framework structure of MVST in ablation experiments, and from the experimental results, it is clear that MVST can achieve a more accurate spatial domain identification compared with the current more advanced methods. In conclusion, MVST is a powerful tool for spatial transcriptome research with improved spatial domain recognition.

                <p>by Caterina Millevoi, Damiano Pasetto, Massimiliano Ferronato</p>

Compartmental models provide simple and efficient tools to analyze the relevant transmission processes during an outbreak, to produce short-term forecasts or transmission scenarios, and to assess the impact of vaccination campaigns. However, their calibration is not straightforward, since many factors contribute to the rapid change of the transmission dynamics. For example, there might be changes in the individual awareness, the imposition of non-pharmacological interventions and the emergence of new variants. As a consequence, model parameters such as the transmission rate are doomed to vary in time, making their assessment more challenging. Here, we propose to use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to track the temporal changes in the model parameters and the state variables. PINNs recently gained attention in many engineering applications thanks to their ability to consider both the information from data (typically uncertain) and the governing equations of the system. The ability of PINNs to identify unknown model parameters makes them particularly suitable to solve ill-posed inverse problems, such as those arising in the application of epidemiological models. Here, we develop a reduced-split approach for the implementation of PINNs to estimate the temporal changes in the state variables and transmission rate of an epidemic based on the SIR model equation and infectious data. The main idea is to split the training first on the epidemiological data, and then on the residual of the system equations. The proposed method is applied to five synthetic test cases and two real scenarios reproducing the first months of the Italian COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the split implementation of PINNs outperforms the joint approach in terms of accuracy (up to one order of magnitude) and computational times (speed up of 20%). Finally, we illustrate that the proposed PINN-method can also be adopted to produced short-term forecasts of the dynamics of an epidemic.

                <p>by Ariel Rokem</p>

As large, high-dimensional data have become more common, software development is playing an increasingly important role in research across many different fields. This creates a need to adopt software engineering practices in research settings. Code review is the engineering practice of giving and receiving detailed feedback on a computer program. Consistent and continuous examination of the evolution of computer programs by others has been shown to be beneficial, especially when reviewers are familiar with the technical aspects of the software and also when they possess relevant domain expertise. The rules described in the present article provide information about the why, when, and how of code review. They provide the motivation for continual code reviews as a natural part of a rigorous research program. They provide practical guidelines for conducting review of code both in person, as a “lab meeting for code,” as well as asynchronously, using industry-standard online tools. A set of guidelines is provided for the nitty-gritty details of code review, as well as for the etiquette of such a review. Both the technical and the social aspects of code review are covered to provide the reader with a comprehensive approach that facilitates an effective, enjoyable, and educational approach to code review.

                <p>by Gustavo Menesse, Joaquín J. Torres</p>

The relation between electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, brain functions, and behavioral correlates is well-established. Some physiological mechanisms underlying rhythm generation are understood, enabling the replication of brain rhythms <i>in silico</i>. This offers a pathway to explore connections between neural oscillations and specific neuronal circuits, potentially yielding fundamental insights into the functional properties of brain waves. Information theory frameworks, such as Integrated information Decomposition (Φ-ID), relate dynamical regimes with informational properties, providing deeper insights into neuronal dynamic functions. Here, we investigate wave emergence in an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balanced network of <i>integrate and fire</i> neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. This model produces a diverse range of EEG-like rhythms, from low <i>δ</i> waves to high-frequency oscillations. Through Φ-ID, we analyze the network’s information dynamics and its relation with different emergent rhythms, elucidating the system’s suitability for functions such as robust information transfer, storage, and parallel operation. Furthermore, our study helps to identify regimes that may resemble pathological states due to poor informational properties and high randomness. We found, e.g., that <i>in silico</i> <i>β</i> and <i>δ</i> waves are associated with maximum information transfer in inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, respectively, and that the coexistence of excitatory <i>θ</i>, <i>α</i>, and <i>β</i> waves is associated to information storage. Additionally, we observed that high-frequency oscillations can exhibit either high or poor informational properties, potentially shedding light on ongoing discussions regarding physiological versus pathological high-frequency oscillations. In summary, our study demonstrates that dynamical regimes with similar oscillations may exhibit vastly different information dynamics. Characterizing information dynamics within these regimes serves as a potent tool for gaining insights into the functions of complex neuronal networks. Finally, our findings suggest that the use of information dynamics in both model and experimental data analysis, could help discriminate between oscillations associated with cognitive functions and those linked to neuronal disorders.

                <p>by Artemy Bakulin, Noam B. Teyssier, Martin Kampmann, Matvei Khoroshkin, Hani Goodarzi</p>

Inferring the driving regulatory programs from comparative analysis of gene expression data is a cornerstone of systems biology. Many computational frameworks were developed to address this problem, including our iPAGE (information-theoretic Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression) toolset that uses information theory to detect non-random patterns of expression associated with given pathways or regulons. Our recent observations, however, indicate that existing approaches are susceptible to the technical biases that are inherent to most real world annotations. To address this, we have extended our information-theoretic framework to account for specific biases and artifacts in biological networks using the concept of conditional information. To showcase pyPAGE, we performed a comprehensive analysis of regulatory perturbations that underlie the molecular etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). pyPAGE successfully recapitulated several known AD-associated gene expression programs. We also discovered several additional regulons whose differential activity is significantly associated with AD. We further explored how these regulators relate to pathological processes in AD through cell-type specific analysis of single cell and spatial gene expression datasets. Our findings showcase the utility of pyPAGE as a precise and reliable biomarker discovery in complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.

How can inter-individual variability be quantified? Measuring many features per experiment raises the question of choosing them to recapitulate high-dimensional data. Tackling this challenge on spindle elongation phenotypes, we showed that only three typical elongation patterns describe spindle elongation in <i>C. elegans</i> one-cell embryo. These archetypes, automatically extracted from the experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA), accounted for more than 95% of inter-individual variability of more than 1600 experiments across more than 100 different conditions. The two first archetypes were related to spindle average length and anaphasic elongation rate. The third archetype, accounting for 6% of the variability, was novel and corresponded to a transient spindle shortening in late metaphase, reminiscent of kinetochore function-defect phenotypes. Importantly, these three archetypes were robust to the choice of the dataset and were found even considering only non-treated conditions. Thus, the inter-individual differences between genetically perturbed embryos have the same underlying nature as natural inter-individual differences between wild-type embryos, independently of the temperatures. We thus propose that beyond the apparent complexity of the spindle, only three independent mechanisms account for spindle elongation, weighted differently in the various conditions. Interestingly, the spindle-length archetypes covered both metaphase and anaphase, suggesting that spindle elongation in late metaphase is sufficient to predict the late anaphase length. We validated this idea using a machine-learning approach. Finally, given amounts of these three archetypes could represent a quantitative phenotype. To take advantage of this, we set out to predict interacting genes from a seed based on the PCA coefficients. We exemplified this firstly on the role of <i>tpxl-1</i> whose homolog <i>tpx2</i> is involved in spindle microtubule branching, secondly the mechanism regulating metaphase length, and thirdly the central spindle players which set the length at anaphase. We found novel interactors not in public databases but supported by recent experimental publications.

Centrosome amplification is a feature of cancer cells associated with chromosome instability and invasiveness. Enhancing chromosome instability and subsequent cancer cell death via centrosome unclustering and multipolar divisions is an aimed-for therapeutic approach. Here, we show that centrosome amplification potentiates responses to conventional chemotherapy in addition to its effect on multipolar divisions and chromosome instability. We perform single-cell live imaging of chemotherapy responses in epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines and observe increased cell death when centrosome amplification is induced. By correlating cell fate with mitotic behaviors, we show that enhanced cell death can occur independently of chromosome instability. We identify that cells with centrosome amplification are primed for apoptosis. We show they are dependent on the apoptotic inhibitor BCL-XL and that this is not a consequence of mitotic stresses associated with centrosome amplification. Given the multiple mechanisms that promote chemotherapy responses in cells with centrosome amplification, we assess such a relationship in an epithelial ovarian cancer patient cohort. We show that high centrosome numbers associate with improved treatment responses and longer overall survival. Our work identifies apoptotic priming as a clinically relevant consequence of centrosome amplification, expanding our understanding of this pleiotropic cancer cell feature.

                Abstract* Background Digital addictions are a major problem worldwide, which has increased considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, two important impact factors to explain this problem are stress and anxiety because of COVID-19. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 on digital addictions. Methods cross-sectional, explanatory study. A total of 802 students from public and private universities residing in the city of Lima and Callao (Peru), with a mean age of 21.68 (SD = 3.11), selected by convenience sampling, participated in the study. The MULTICAGE CAD-4 questionnaire, the distress scale, and the COVID-19 worry scale were applied. Results two models examined with structural equation modeling showed good fit indices (CFI and TLI > .95, RMSEA and SRMR < .06). The first model shows that the latent variables distress and anxiety due to COVID-19 have direct effects on digital addictions as a general construct (R2 = 22%). The second model shows that the exogenous latent variables (stress and anxiety) have direct effects of different magnitudes on each digital technology, so the variance explained on smartphone addiction was higher (R2 = 25%) with respect to internet (R2 = 19%) and video game addiction (R2 = 6%). It was also found that for every male, there are two females with high levels of distress and anxiety. Regarding the problematic use of smartphones and internet, there is a prevalence of 40% regardless of sex; but as for the problematic use of video games, there is a marked difference between males (18.8%) and females (2.7%). Conclusion the distress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 have a direct impact in aggravating digital addictions.

<p>Immune cell-derived IL-4 induces Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages to express BDNF. Following the injection of IL-4 neutralizing antibody into the infarct, the BDNF, IL-4 protein lev and the quantity of BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells significantly decreased.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We reported that infiltrated Ly6C<sup>+</sup> macrophages express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) only at the cerebral cortex infarct in a rat dMCAO model. However, the changein neuron-expressed BDNF, the niche components that induce the Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF, and the cellular sources of these components, remain unclear. In this study, immunofluorescence double staining was performed to label BDNF and Ly6C on brain sections at 3, 24, and 48 h following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) of male rats, and to stain BDNF with Ly6C, IL-4R, and IL-10R. A neutralizing anti-IL-4 antibody was injected into the infarct, and the IL-4 and BDNF concentrations in the subareas of the infarct were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To find out the cellular sources of IL-4, the markers for microglia, T cells, and neurons were co-stained with IL-4 separately. In certain infarct subareas, the main BDNF-expressing cells shifted quickly from NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons to Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells during 24–48 h post-stroke, and the Ly6C<sup>+</sup>/BDNF<sup>+</sup> cells mostly expressed IL-4 receptor. Following IL-4 neutralizing antibody injection, the BDNF, IL-4 protein levels, and BDNF<sup>+</sup>/Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells decreased significantly. The main IL-4-expressing cell type in this infarct subarea is not neuron either, but immune cells, including microglia, monocyte, macrophages, and T cells. The neurons, maintained BDNF and IL-4 expression in the peri-infarct area. In conclusion, in a specific cerebral subarea of the rat dMCAO model, IL-4 secreted by immune cells is one of the main inducers for Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells to express BDNF.</p>

     alt="Thorny and Tufted Retinal Ganglion Cells Express the Transcription Factor Forkhead Proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 in Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>We identify a novel ganglion cell type in marmoset retina, named tufted cell, which expresses the transcription factor Foxp2. Tufted cells are characterized by bare primary dendrites which branch frequently in the peripheral dendritic field to form dense tufts. The dendritic stratification and overall dendritic field size of tufted cells is otherwise comparable to that of broad thorny ganglion cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The transcription factor forkhead/winged-helix domain proteins Foxp1 and Foxp2 have previously been studied in mouse retina, where they are expressed in retinal ganglion cells named F-mini and F-midi. Here we show that both transcription factors are expressed by small subpopulations (on average less than 10%) of retinal ganglion cells in the retina of the marmoset monkey (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). The morphology of Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells was revealed by intracellular DiI injections of immunofluorescent cells. Foxp1- and Foxp2-expressing cells comprised multiple types of wide-field ganglion cells, including broad thorny cells, narrow thorny cells, and tufted cells. The large majority of Foxp2-expressing cells were identified as tufted cells. Tufted cells stratify broadly in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. They resemble broad thorny cells but their proximal dendrites are bare of branches and the distal dendrites branch frequently forming dense dendritic tufts. Double labeling with calretinin, a previously established marker for broad thorny and narrow thorny cells, showed that only a small proportion of ganglion cells co-expressed calretinin and Foxp1 or Foxp2 supporting the idea that the two markers are differentially expressed in retinal ganglion cells of marmoset retina.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We have investigated the hippocampal connectivity of the marmoset presubiculum (PreS) and reported that major connections of PreS in the rat were conserved in the marmoset. Moreover, our results indicated the presence of several additional projections that were almost absent in the rat brain, but abundant in the marmoset, such as direct projections from CA1 to PreS. However, little is known about the connectivity between the frontal brain regions and PreS or hippocampal formation. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cells of the origins and terminals of the presubicular and hippocampal projections in the marmoset frontal brain regions using the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. In cases of tracer injections into all layers of PreS, many neurons and terminals were labeled in the claustrum–endopiriform (Cl–En) complex almost entirely along the rostrocaudal axis. Even in cases where the injection site involved the superficial (not deep) layers of PreS, labeled neurons and terminals were distributed over a wide rostrocaudal range of the Cl–En complex, but their number and density were significantly lower than the whole-layer injection cases. In cases where the injection site was confined to the hippocampal formation, labeled cells and terminals were localized at a restricted portion of the Cl–En complex. Here, we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time the strong, reciprocal connections of the Cl–En complex with PreS and projections from the Cl–En complex to the hippocampal regions (CA1 and the subiculum) in the marmoset. Our findings indicate that the Cl–En complex may exert a strong influence on the cortical and subcortical outputs from PreS and, in turn, the entire memory circuitry in the marmoset brain.</p>

     alt="Sources of Rapid and Delayed New Lower Jaw Input in the Forepaw Barrel Subfield (FBS) in Rat Primary Somatosensory Cortex (SI) Following Forelimb Deafferentation"/>
<p>The rat's forepaw is represented in the forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) of the somatosensory cortex. After forelimb input loss, the anterior FBS immediately responds to lower jaw stimulation, with the entire FBS doing so in 7 weeks. The lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) supplies immediate input, whereas the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus provides new delayed input to the posterior FBS.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Previously, we reported an immediate emergence of new lower jaw input to the anterior forepaw barrel subfield (FBS) in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) following forelimb deafferentation. However, a delay of 7 weeks or more post-amputation results in the presence of this new input to both anterior and posterior FBS. The immediate change suggests pre-existing latent lower jaw input in the FBS, whereas the delayed alteration implies the involvement of alternative sources. One possible source for immediate lower jaw responses is the neighboring lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF). We used anatomical tracers to investigate the possible projection of LJBSF to the FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) anterograde tracer injection into LJBSF in normal and amputated rats labeled fibers and terminals exclusively in the anterior FBS; (2) retrograde tracer injection in the anterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, heavily labeled cell bodies predominantly in the posterior LJBSF, with fewer in the anterior LJBSF; (3) retrograde tracer injection in the posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, sparsely labeled cell bodies in the posterior LJBSF; (4) retrograde tracer injection in anterior and posterior FBS in normal and forelimb-amputated rats, labeled cells exclusively in ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus and posterior thalamus (PO); (5) retrograde tracer injection in LJBSF-labeled cell bodies exclusively in ventral posterior medial thalamic nucleus and PO. These findings suggest that LJBSF facilitates rapid lower jaw reorganization in the anterior FBS, whereas VPL and/or other subcortical sites provide a likely substrate for delayed reorganization observed in the posterior FBS.</p>

     alt="Scaled Complexity of Mammalian Astrocytes: Insights From Mouse and Macaque"/>
<p>We used a multi-technique approach (including immunohistochemistry, AAV-mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy) to label astrocytes in mice and rhesus macaques and conducted a comprehensive morphological analysis. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Astrocytes intricately weave within the neuropil, giving rise to characteristic bushy morphologies. Pioneering studies suggested that primate astrocytes are more complex due to increased branch numbers and territory size compared to rodent counterparts. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of astrocyte morphology across species. We employed several techniques to investigate astrocyte morphology and directly compared them between mice and rhesus macaques in cortical and subcortical regions. We assessed astrocyte density, territory size, branching structure, fine morphological complexity, and interactions with neuronal synapses using a combination of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, adeno-associated virus–mediated transduction of astrocytes, diOlistics, confocal imaging, and electron microscopy. We found significant morphological similarities between primate and rodent astrocytes, suggesting that astrocyte structure has scaled with evolution. Our findings show that primate astrocytes are larger and more numerous than those in rodents but contest the view that primate astrocytes are morphologically far more complex.</p>

                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

                Background: In the evaluation of research proposals, reviewers are often required to provide their opinions using various forms of quantitative and qualitative criteria. In 2020, the European Commission removed, for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) funding scheme, the numerical scores from the individual evaluations but retained them in the consensus report. This study aimed to assess whether there were any differences in reviewer comments’ linguistic characteristics after the numerical scoring was removed, compared to comments from 2019 when numerical scoring was still present. Methods: This was an observational study and the data were collected for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks (ITN) evaluation reports from the calls of 2019 and 2020, for both individual and consensus comments and numerical scores about the quality of the research proposal on three evaluation criteria: Excellence, Impact and Implementation. All comments were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Results: For both years, the comments for proposal’s strengths were written in a style that reflects objectivity, clout, and positive affect, while in weaknesses cold and objective style dominated, and that pattern remained stable across proposal status and research domains. Linguistic variables explained a very small proportion of the variance of the differences between 2019 and 2020 (McFadden R2=0.03). Conclusions: Removing the numerical scores was not associated with the differences in linguistic characteristics of the reviewer comments. Future studies should adopt a qualitative approach to assess whether there are conceptual changes in the content of the comments.

                Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people's economies, lifestyles, and physical, emotional, and sleep health. This research aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression among teachers with the resumption of in-person instruction at schools following a hiatus after COVID-19 lockdowns in India. We also studied the association of teachers' insomnia with psychological symptoms and demographic variables. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between October –November 2021 after schools had reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected using standard questionnaires online among schoolteachers. We explored the association of insomnia with teachers' symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, sex, school boards, and age groups. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers surveyed, the prevalence of insomnia was 37.9% (subthreshold in 25% and clinical in 12.9%). The prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety was 20.2%, 30.6%, and 45.2%, respectively. There was a significant association (p<0.001) of insomnia with symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, we found that those feeling stressed had a 6.4 times higher risk of insomnia (95% CI: 1.5-28.3, p - 0.01). There was no association of insomnia with age, sex, school educational boards, and type of institution. Conclusions: Over one-third (37.9%) of teachers reported having trouble sleeping when they returned to the school's typical face-to-face instruction modalities through COVID-19 times, and insomnia was more prevalent in those with stress.

                Background The concept of euthanasia has recently come into the spotlight, and cases such as those of Aruna Shanbaug have heavily influenced people’s opinions on the topic. Whether euthanasia is performed with the intention of ending suffering that otherwise cannot be helped should truly be supported. The thoughts on this topic- especially of those who work closely with patients who suffer from terminal illnesses- healthcare providers must be analyzed. Their perception and views on legalizing the procedure and their hesitancy or lack thereof to perform such a procedure would give the rest of the world a clearer picture- a better standpoint to understand what to do. This study attempted to quantify and analyze the views of doctors and medical students regarding euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 212 doctors and medical students at a private medical college in South India was conducted to determine their attitudes toward euthanasia. Results Most participants (66%) supported the practice of euthanasia. The majority of participants also believed that euthanasia should only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient (71.7%). It was also observed that those who had heard about euthanasia via hearsay mostly agreed that it must only be performed with the explicit consent of the patient. Moreover, the study showed that those who had heard about it from hearsay and news mostly stood for it. Conclusion It has been noted that news and media all around us heavily influence people’s opinions. It is concluded that these opinions have changed from the past, and will likely do so depending on the environment and media around the topic.

                A major aim of neuroscience is to identify and model the functional properties of neural cells whose dysfunction underlie neuropsychiatric illness. In this article, we propose that human-derived monoclonal autoantibodies (HD-mAbs) are well positioned to selectively target and manipulate neural subpopulations as defined by their protein expression; that is, cellular proteotypes. Recent technical advances allow for efficient cloning of autoantibodies from neuropsychiatric patients. These HD-mAbs can be introduced into animal models to gain biological and pathobiological insights about neural proteotypes of interest. Protein engineering can be used to modify, enhance, silence, or confer new functional properties to native HD-mAbs, thereby enhancing their versatility. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations confronting HD-mAbs as experimental research tools for neuroscience.

                In multi-month recordings of the mouse hippocampus, McGregor et al. ask which homeostatic set-points in neuronal activity are undermined by tauopathy. Criticality, an emergent endpoint, is severely disrupted by the disease, while the activity of underlying individual neurons appears unaffected. These findings suggest a dynamical locus by which tauopathy disrupts neuronal function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89996">Asymmetric distribution of color-opponent response types across mouse visual cortex supports superior color vision in the sky</a></h4>

              
                Color is an important visual feature that informs behavior, and the retinal basis for color vision has been studied across various vertebrate species. While many studies have investigated how color information is processed in visual brain areas of primate species, we have limited understanding of how it is organized beyond the retina in other species, including most dichromatic mammals. In this study, we systematically characterized how color is represented in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. Using large-scale neuronal recordings and a luminance and color noise stimulus, we found that more than a third of neurons in mouse V1 are color-opponent in their receptive field center, while the receptive field surround predominantly captures luminance contrast. Furthermore, we found that color-opponency is especially pronounced in posterior V1 that encodes the sky, matching the statistics of natural scenes experienced by mice. Using unsupervised clustering, we demonstrate that the asymmetry in color representations across cortex can be explained by an uneven distribution of green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response types that are represented in the upper visual field. Finally, a simple model with natural scene-inspired parametric stimuli shows that green-On/UV-Off color-opponent response types may enhance the detection of ‘predatory’-like dark UV-objects in noisy daylight scenes. The results from this study highlight the relevance of color processing in the mouse visual system and contribute to our understanding of how color information is organized in the visual hierarchy across species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93789">Analysis of fast calcium dynamics of honey bee olfactory coding</a></h4>

              
                Odour processing exhibits multiple parallels between vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems. Insects, in particular, have emerged as relevant models for olfactory studies because of the tractability of their olfactory circuits. Here, we used fast calcium imaging to track the activity of projection neurons in the honey bee antennal lobe (AL) during olfactory stimulation at high temporal resolution. We observed a heterogeneity of response profiles and an abundance of inhibitory activities, resulting in various response latencies and stimulus-specific post-odour neural signatures. Recorded calcium signals were fed to a mushroom body (MB) model constructed implementing the fundamental features of connectivity between olfactory projection neurons, Kenyon cells (KC), and MB output neurons (MBON). The model accounts for the increase of odorant discrimination in the MB compared to the AL and reveals the recruitment of two distinct KC populations that represent odorants and their aftersmell as two separate but temporally coherent neural objects. Finally, we showed that the learning-induced modulation of KC-to-MBON synapses can explain both the variations in associative learning scores across different conditioning protocols used in bees and the bees' response latency. Thus, it provides a simple explanation of how the time contingency between the stimulus and the reward can be encoded without the need for time tracking. This study broadens our understanding of olfactory coding and learning in honey bees. It demonstrates that a model based on simple MB connectivity rules and fed with real physiological data can explain fundamental aspects of odour processing and associative learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97150">A robust brain network for sustained attention from adolescence to adulthood that predicts later substance use</a></h4>

              
                Substance use, including cigarettes and cannabis, is associated with poorer sustained attention in late adolescence and early adulthood. Previous studies were predominantly cross-sectional or under-powered and could not indicate if impairment in sustained attention was a predictor of substance use or a marker of the inclination to engage in such behavior. This study explored the relationship between sustained attention and substance use across a longitudinal span from ages 14 to 23 in over 1000 participants. Behaviors and brain connectivity associated with diminished sustained attention at age 14 predicted subsequent increases in cannabis and cigarette smoking, establishing sustained attention as a robust biomarker for vulnerability to substance use. Individual differences in network strength relevant to sustained attention were preserved across developmental stages and sustained attention networks generalized to participants in an external dataset. In summary, brain networks of sustained attention are robust, consistent, and able to predict aspects of later substance use.

                miRNAs constitute fine-tuners of gene expression and are implicated in a variety of diseases spanning from inflammation to cancer. miRNA expression is deregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, their specific role in key arthritogenic cells such as the synovial fibroblast (SF) remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that <i>Mir221/222</i> expression is upregulated in RA SFs. Here, we demonstrate that TNF and IL-1β but not IFN-γ activated <i>Mir221</i>/222 gene expression in murine SFs. SF-specific overexpression of <i>Mir221/222</i> in huTNFtg mice led to further expansion of SFs and disease exacerbation, while its total ablation led to reduced SF expansion and attenuated disease. <i>Mir221/222</i> overexpression altered the SF transcriptional profile igniting pathways involved in cell cycle and ECM (extracellular matrix) regulation. Validation of targets of <i>Mir221/222</i> revealed cell cycle inhibitors <i>Cdkn1b</i> and <i>Cdkn1c</i>, as well as the epigenetic regulator <i>Smarca1</i>. Single-cell ATAC-seq data analysis revealed increased <i>Mir221</i>/222 gene activity in pathogenic SF subclusters and transcriptional regulation by <i>Rela</i>, <i>Relb</i>, <i>Junb</i>, <i>Bach1</i>, and <i>Nfe2l2</i>. Our results establish an SF-specific pathogenic role of <i>Mir221/222</i> in arthritis and suggest that its therapeutic targeting in specific subpopulations could lead to novel fibroblast-targeted therapies.

                Mutational profiles of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have established that a relatively small number of genetic aberrations, including SF3B1 and SRSF2 spliceosome mutations, lead to specific phenotypes and prognostic subgrouping. We performed a multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) on two published MDS cohorts of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) and CD34 + cells with three data modalities (clinical, genotype, and transcriptomics). Seven different views, including immune profile, inflammation/aging, retrotransposon (RTE) expression, and cell-type composition, were derived from these modalities to identify the latent factors with significant impact on MDS prognosis. SF3B1 was the only mutation among 13 mutations in the BMMNC cohort, indicating a significant association with high inflammation. This trend was also observed to a lesser extent in the CD34 + cohort. Interestingly, the MOFA factor representing the inflammation shows a good prognosis for MDS patients with high inflammation. In contrast, SRSF2 mutant cases show a granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) pattern and high levels of senescence, immunosenescence, and malignant myeloid cells, consistent with their poor prognosis. Furthermore, MOFA identified RTE expression as a risk factor for MDS. This work elucidates the efficacy of our integrative approach to assess the MDS risk that goes beyond all the scoring systems described thus far for MDS.

                Noncoding RNA plays a pivotal role as novel regulators of endothelial cell function. Type 2 diabetes, acknowledged as a primary contributor to cardiovascular diseases, plays a vital role in vascular endothelial cell dysfunction due to induced abnormalities of glucolipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In this study, aberrant expression levels of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> were observed in diabetes-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell dysfunction. Persistent inhibition of <i>MIR4521</i> accelerated development and exacerbated vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, <i>circHMGCS1</i> upregulated arginase 1 by sponging <i>MIR4521</i>, leading to decrease in vascular nitric oxide secretion and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and generation of cellular reactive oxygen species, reduced vasodilation and accelerated the impairment of vascular endothelial function. Collectively, these findings illuminate the physiological role and interacting mechanisms of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> in diabetes-induced cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that modulating the expression of <i>circHMGCS1</i> and <i>MIR4521</i> could serve as a potential strategy to prevent diabetes-associated cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, our findings provide a novel technical avenue for unraveling ncRNAs regulatory roles of ncRNAs in diabetes and its associated complications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94181">UPRER–immunity axis acts as physiological food evaluation system that promotes aversion behavior in sensing low-quality food</a></h4>

              
                To survive in challenging environments, animals must develop a system to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system, which monitors specific nutrients from ingested food and influences food-response behavior, are still not fully understood. Here, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed <i>E. coli</i> (HK-<i>E. coli),</i> a low-sugar food, triggers cellular UPR<sup>ER</sup> and immune response. This encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (IRE-1/XBP-1) - Innate immunity (PMK-1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPR<sup>ER</sup> -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.

                Chemical synapses are fundamental units for the transmission of information throughout the nervous system. The cytoskeleton allows to build, maintain and transform both pre- and postsynaptic contacts, yet its organization and the role of its unique synaptic nanostructures are still poorly understood. Here we present a presynapse-on-glass model where presynaptic specializations are robustly induced along the axons of cultured neurons by micropatterned dots of neuroligin, allowing the controlled orientation and easy optical visualization of functional induced presynapses. We demonstrate the relevance and usefulness of this presynapse-on-glass model for the study of presynaptic actin architecture, showing that a majority of induced presynapses are enriched in actin, with this enrichment being correlated to higher synaptic cycling activity. We confirm our previous results on bead-induced presynapses by identifying the same distinct actin nanostructures within presynapses: corrals, rails and mesh. Furthermore, we leverage the controlled orientation of the presynapse-on-glass model, visualizing the arrangement of these actin structures relative to the active zone nanoclusters using multicolor 3D Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), and relative to the sub-diffractive localization exocytic events using a correlative live-cell and SMLM approach.

                Animals continously adapt their behavior to balance survival and fulfilling essential needs. This balancing act involves prioritization of safety over the pursuit of other needs. However, the specific deep brain circuits that regulate safety-seeking behaviors in conjuction with motor circuits remain poorly understood. Here we identify a class of glutamatergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) that target the midbrain locomotor-promoting pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Upon activation, this LHA-PPN pathway orchestrates context-dependent locomotion, prioritizing safety-directed movement over other essential needs such as foraging or mating. Remarkably, the neuronal activity of these circuits correlates directly with safety-seeking behavior. These circuits may respond to both intrinsic and external cues, playing a pivotal role in ensuring survival. Our findings uncover a circuit motif within the lateral hypothalamus that when recruited, prioritizes critical needs through the recruitment of an appropriate motor action.

">Dissociable dynamic effects of expectation during statistical learning.</a></h4>

              
                The brain is thought to generate internal predictions, based on previous statistical regularities in the environment, to optimise behaviour. Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.

">Hippocampal neuronal activity is aligned with action plans</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards, and actions, where the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.

">Using TMS-EEG to study the intricate interplay between GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation during reactive and proactive motor inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Background: Combining Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) enables assess TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) and estimate {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamatergic neurotransmission across the entire motor inhibition network. The N45 and N100 TEP peaks are associated with GABAa and GABAb signaling, respectively, whereas the N15, P30 and P60 TEPs reflect glutamatergic neurotransmission. This study applied TMS-EEG to investigate modulation of TEP components during reactive and proactive inhibition and whether individual differences in GABA and glutamate signaling predict inhibitory performance. Methods: Twenty-four healthy participants completed two TMS-EEG sessions, targeting either the left primary motor cortex (M1) or the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) at rest and during a stop-signal task. We compared TEP peak amplitudes across TMS (active/sham) and Trial Type (stop/go trials) and assessed their relationship with task performance. Results: Participants with a higher N45 amplitude at rest over M1, reflecting increased GABAa signaling, demonstrated a faster stop-signal reaction time. TMS during motor inhibition revealed higher N15 amplitudes over preSMA, reflecting increased glutamatergic neurotransmission, for successful stops versus go trials. Similarly, N15 was higher for uncertain than certain go trials suggesting that an early excitatory signal from preSMA is crucial for both reactive and proactive motor inhibition. Conclusion: Higher GABAa inhibitory signaling in M1 at rest is linked to faster reactive inhibition. The preSMA likely plays a key role in both reactive and proactive motor inhibition. Here we provide novel direct empirical insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, highlighting a functional relevance of early glutamatergic excitatory signals for successful motor inhibition.

">Nonlinear dendritic integration supports Up-Down states in single neurons</a></h4>

              
                Changes in the activity profile of cortical neurons are due to phenomena at the scale of local and long-range networks. Accordingly, the often abrupt transitions in the state of cortical neurons - a phenomenon known as Up-Down states - are attributed to variations in the afferent neurons' activity. However, cellular physiology and morphology may also play a role. This study examines the impact of dendritic nonlinearities, in the form of voltage-gated NMDA receptors, on the response of cortical neurons to balanced excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Using a neuron model with two segregated dendritic compartments, we compare cells with and without dendritic nonlinearities. Our analysis shows that NMDA receptors boost somatic firing in the balanced condition and increase the correlation of membrane potentials across the three compartments of the neuron model. Then, we introduce controlled fluctuations in excitatory inputs and quantify the ensuing bimodality of the somatic membrane potential. We show that dendritic nonlinearities are crucial for detecting these fluctuations and initiating Up-Down states whose shape and statistics closely resemble electrophysiological data. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical bistability and highlight the complex interplay between dendritic integration and network dynamics in shaping neuronal behavior.

However, the roles of domain-general and language-specific brain regions during this process remain unclear. To investigate this, we applied intermittent theta burst stimulation over the domain-general (group left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and domain-specific (Group L IFG) brain regions, with a control group receiving sham intermittent theta burst stimulation. Intermittent theta burst stimulation effects were subsequently assessed in functional magnetic resonance imaging using an artificial word learning task which consisted of 3 learning phases. A generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis explored the whole brain functional connectivity, while dynamic causal modeling estimated causal interactions in specific brain regions modulated by intermittent theta burst stimulation during repeated exposure. Compared to sham stimulation, active intermittent theta burst stimulation improved word learning performance and reduced activation of the left insula in learning phase 2. Active intermittent theta burst stimulation over the domain-general region increased whole–brain functional connectivity and modulated effective connectivity between brain regions during repeated exposure. This effect was not observed when active intermittent theta burst stimulation was applied to the language-specific region. These findings suggest that the domain-general region plays a crucial role in word formation rule learning, with intermittent theta burst stimulation enhancing whole-brain connectivity and facilitating efficient information exchange between key brain regions during new word learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Our understanding of the neurobiology underlying cognitive dysfunction in persons with cerebral palsy is very limited, especially in the neurocognitive domain of visual selective attention. This investigation utilized magnetoencephalography and an Eriksen arrow-based flanker task to quantify the dynamics underlying selective attention in a cohort of youth and adults with cerebral palsy (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 31; age range = 9 to 47 yr) and neurotypical controls (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 38; age range = 11 to 49 yr). The magnetoencephalography data were transformed into the time-frequency domain to identify neural oscillatory responses and imaged using a beamforming approach. The behavioral results indicated that all participants exhibited a flanker effect (greater response time for the incongruent compared to congruent condition) and that individuals with cerebral palsy were slower and less accurate during task performance. We computed interference maps to focus on the attentional component and found aberrant alpha (8 to 14 Hz) oscillations in the right primary visual cortices in the group with cerebral palsy. Alpha and theta (4 to 7 Hz) oscillations were also seen in the left and right insula, and these oscillations varied with age across all participants. Overall, persons with cerebral palsy exhibit deficiencies in the cortical dynamics serving visual selective attention, but these aberrations do not appear to be uniquely affected by age.</span>

	<p>The aim of this cross-sectional study was to translate, culturally adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) in post-stroke individuals. The original MASA scale was translated and culturally adapted from English to Italian following the international guidelines. The internal consistency and test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability of the MASA-IT were assessed, and its concurrent validity was examined through Pearson correlation coefficients with the Italian versions of two established gold standard scales for dysphagia assessment: the Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) and the De Pippo Test&amp;amp;mdash;Three Oz Water Swallow. The MASA-IT was administered to 78 participants. The items demonstrated excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha ranging between 0.86 and 0.89. The interclass correlation coefficient was 0.98 for inter-rater reliability and 0.99 for intra-rater reliability, indicating high reproducibility. Regarding concurrent validity, the MASA-IT showed a strong direct correlation with the DOSS scale (r = 0.949, p = 0.01) and an inverse correlation with the De Pippo Test (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.783, p = 0.01), confirming its good concurrent validity. The Italian version of the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA-IT) is a reliable and valid tool for assessing swallowing ability in post-stroke patients. Its strong psychometric properties make it well suited for clinical use in Italy.</p>

	<p>The role of mitochondria in neurodegenerative diseases is crucial, and recent developments have highlighted its significance in cell therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases. Understanding the impact of mitochondrial biology on these conditions can provide valuable insights for developing targeted cell therapies. This mini-review refocuses on mitochondria and emphasizes the potential of therapies leveraging mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, stem cell&amp;amp;ndash;derived secretions, and extracellular vesicles. Mesenchymal stem cell&amp;amp;ndash;mediated mitochondria transfer is highlighted for restoring mitochondrial health in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Additionally, attention is paid to gene-editing techniques such as mito-CRISPR, mitoTALENs, mito-ZNFs, and DdCBEs to ensure the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatments. Challenges and future directions are also discussed, including the possible tumorigenic effects of stem cells, off-target effects, disease targeting, immune rejection, and ethical issues.</p>

	<p>The Coanda effect is a fluid dynamics phenomenon in which a fluid jet adheres to a convex or flat surface. This effect occurs when a liquid or gas jet emerging from an orifice clings to an adjacent surface and entrains the surrounding fluid, creating a lower-pressure region along its path that maintains its attachment to the surface. The Coanda effect accounts for the behavior of blood flow in the fetal right atrium and the dispersion of eccentric mitral regurgitation jets along atrial walls. This series of interesting images depicting a large 4 &amp;amp;times; 3.75 cm saccular intracranial aneurysm suggests that the Coanda effect may play a role in the pathophysiology of intracranial aneurysms and could be an underlying factor in their formation, progression, or rupture.</p>

	<p>Spatial orientation and navigation are complex cognitive functions that integrate sensory information, attention, and memory, enabling individuals to locate themselves in their environment. These abilities decline with age, signaling cognitive impairment in neurological patients, and significantly limit the autonomy of the elderly. Current neuropsychological assessments fall short in accurately measuring everyday wayfinding abilities, particularly in borderline cases of cognitive decline. This paper reviews various neuropsychological assessments, including Benton&amp;amp;rsquo;s Judgment of Line Orientation Test, the Almeria Spatial Memory Recognition Test, the Spatial Span subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Spatial Orientation in Immersive Virtual Environment Maze Test, evaluating their effectiveness in delineating spatial orientation and navigation skills. The review identifies significant gaps in the validity and reliability of these tests, particularly in their shortened versions, and highlights the potential of virtual reality environments as promising tools for improving diagnostic precision. The findings underscore the need for further research to refine these tools, ensuring they accurately capture cognitive decline and improve the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Such advancements hold promise for enhancing the quality of care and autonomy for the elderly.</p>

                <p>Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed either to synaptic scaling or to a slide threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked in mice of all sexes whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2&ndash;6&nbsp;d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo<I>.</I> The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2&nbsp;d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results support the idea that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.</p>

                <p>Brain nuclei are traditionally defined by their anatomy, activity, and expression of specific markers. The hypothalamus contains discrete neuronal populations that coordinate fundamental behavioral functions, including sleep and wakefulness, in all vertebrates. Particularly, the diverse roles of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt)-releasing neurons suggest functional heterogeneity among Hcrt neurons. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging of the adult male and female zebrafish hypothalamic periventricular zone, we identified 21 glutamatergic and 28 GABAergic cell types. Integration of zebrafish and mouse scRNA-seq revealed evolutionary conserved and divergent hypothalamic cell types. The expression of specific genes, including <I>npvf</I>, which encodes a sleep-regulating neuropeptide, was enriched in subsets of glutamatergic Hcrt neurons in both larval and adult zebrafish. The genetic profile, activity, and neurite processing of the neuronal subpopulation that coexpresses both Hcrt and Npvf (Hcrt+Npvf+) differ from other Hcrt neurons. These interspecies findings provide a unified annotation of hypothalamic cell types and suggest that the heterogeneity of Hcrt neurons enables multifunctionality, such as consolidation of both wake and sleep by the Hcrt- and Npvf-releasing neuronal subpopulation.</p>

                <p>The developed human brain shows remarkable plasticity following perceptual learning, resulting in improved visual sensitivity. However, such improvements commonly require extensive stimuli exposure. Here we show that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural mechanisms relative to standard repetition-based learning. Participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men) encoded a visual discrimination task, followed by brief memory reactivations of only five trials each performed on separate days, demonstrating improvements comparable with standard repetition-based learning (<I>n</I> = 20, 12 women, 8 men). Reactivation-induced learning engaged increased bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity relative to repetition-based learning. Complementary evidence for differential learning processes was further provided by temporal&ndash;parietal resting functional connectivity changes, which correlated with behavioral improvements. The results suggest that efficiently enhancing visual perception with minimal stimuli exposure recruits distinct neural processes, engaging higher-order control and attentional resources while leading to similar perceptual gains. These unique brain mechanisms underlying improved perceptual learning efficiency may have important implications for daily life and in clinical conditions requiring relearning following brain damage.</p>

                <p>Contrary to its well-established role in declarative learning, the impact of sleep on motor memory consolidation remains a subject of debate. Current literature suggests that while motor skill learning benefits from sleep, consolidation of sensorimotor adaptation (SMA) depends solely on the passage of time. This has led to the proposal that SMA may be an exception to other types of memories. Here, we addressed this ongoing controversy in humans through three comprehensive experiments using the visuomotor adaptation paradigm (<I>N</I> = 290, 150 females). In Experiment 1, we investigated the impact of sleep on memory retention when the temporal gap between training and sleep was not controlled. In line with the previous literature, we found that memory consolidates with the passage of time. In Experiment 2, we used an anterograde interference protocol to determine the time window during which SMA memory is most fragile and, thus, potentially most sensitive to sleep intervention. Our results show that memory is most vulnerable during the initial hour post-training. Building on this insight, in Experiment 3, we investigated the impact of sleep when it coincided with the critical first hour of memory consolidation. This manipulation unveiled a benefit of sleep (30% memory enhancement) alongside an increase in spindle density and spindle&ndash;SO coupling during NREM sleep, two well-established neural markers of sleep consolidation. Our findings reconcile seemingly conflicting perspectives on the active role of sleep in motor learning and point to common mechanisms at the basis of memory formation.</p>

                <p>Cognitive flexibility represents the capacity to switch among different mental schemes, providing an adaptive advantage to a changing environment. The neural underpinnings of this executive function have been deeply studied in humans through fMRI, showing that the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) are crucial. Here, we investigated the inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in these regions by means of -aminobutyric acid (GABA+) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx), measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, during a cognitive flexibility task and its relationship with the performance level and the local task-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in 40 young (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 26 female) and 40 older (18&ndash;35&nbsp;years; 21 female) human adults. As the IFC and the IPL are richly connected regions, we also examined whole-brain effects associated with their local metabolic activity. Results did not show absolute metabolic modulations associated with flexibility performance, but the performance level was related to the direction of metabolic modulation in the IPL with opposite patterns in young and older individuals. The individual inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance modulation showed an inverse relationship with the local BOLD response in the IPL. Finally, the modulation of inhibitory&ndash;excitatory balance in IPL was related to whole-brain effects only in older individuals. These findings show disparities in the metabolic mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility in young and older adults and their association with the performance level and BOLD response. Such metabolic differences are likely to play a role in executive functioning during aging and specifically in cognitive flexibility.</p>

                <p>Multiple mutations in the <I>Rhodopsin</I> gene cause sector retinitis pigmentosa in humans and a corresponding light-exacerbated retinal degeneration (RD) in animal models. Previously we have shown that T4K rhodopsin requires photoactivation to exert its toxic effect. Here we further investigated the mechanisms involved in rod cell death caused by T4K rhodopsin in mixed male and female <I>Xenopus laevis</I>. In this model, RD was prevented by rearing animals in constant darkness but surprisingly also in constant light. RD was maximized by light cycles containing at least 1&nbsp;h of darkness and 20&nbsp;min of light exposure, light intensities &gt;750&nbsp;lux, and by a sudden light onset. Under conditions of frequent light cycling, RD occurred rapidly and synchronously, with massive shedding of ROS fragments into the RPE initiated within hours and subsequent death and phagocytosis of rod cell bodies. RD was minimized by reduced light levels, pretreatment with constant light, and gradual light onset. RD was prevented by genetic ablation of the retinal isomerohydrolase RPE65 and exacerbated by ablation of phototransduction components GNAT1, SAG, and GRK1. Our results indicate that photoactivated T4K rhodopsin is toxic, that cell death requires synchronized photoactivation of T4K rhodopsin, and that toxicity is mitigated by interaction with other rod outer segment proteins regardless of whether they participate in activation or shutoff of phototransduction. In contrast, RD caused by P23H rhodopsin does not require photoactivation of the mutant protein, as it was exacerbated by RPE65 ablation, suggesting that these phenotypically similar disorders may require different treatment strategies.</p>

                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucial for tracking various aspects of expected outcomes, thereby helping to guide choices and support learning. Our previous study showed that the effects of reward timing and size on the activity of single units in OFC were dissociable when these attributes were manipulated independently ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B9">Roesch et al., 2006</cross-ref>). However, in real-life decision-making scenarios, outcome features often change simultaneously, so here we investigated how OFC neurons in male rats integrate information about the timing and identity (flavor) of reward and respond to changes in these features, according to whether they were changed simultaneously or separately. We found that a substantial number of OFC neurons fired differentially to immediate versus delayed reward and to the different reward flavors. However, contrary to the previous study, selectivity for timing was strongly correlated with selectivity for identity. Taken together with the previous research, these results suggest that when reward features are correlated, OFC tends to "pack" them into unitary constructs, whereas when they are independent, OFC tends to "crack" them into separate constructs. Furthermore, we found that when both reward timing and flavor were changed, reward-responsive OFC neurons showed unique activity patterns preceding and during the omission of an expected reward. Interestingly, this OFC activity is similar and slightly preceded the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA DA) activity observed in a previous study ( <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Takahashi et al., 2023</cross-ref>), consistent with the role of OFC in providing predictive information to VTA DA neurons.</p>

                <p>An interoceptive homeostatic reflex monitors levels of CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> to maintain blood gas homeostasis and rapidly regulate tissue acid&ndash;base balance by driving lung ventilation and CO<SUB>2</SUB> excretion&mdash;this CO<SUB>2</SUB>-evoked increase in respiration is the hypercapnic ventilatory reflex (HCVR). Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons provide crucial excitatory drive to downstream respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits, and their activity is directly modulated by changes in CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>. RTN neurons express GPR4 and TASK-2, global deletion of which abrogates CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> activation of RTN neurons and the HCVR. It has not been determined if the intrinsic pH sensitivity of these proton detectors is required for these effects. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice with mutations in either of two pH-sensing histidine residues in GPR4 to determine effects on RTN neuronal CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity and the HCVR. In global GPR4(H81F) and GPR4(H167F) mice, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing and CO<SUB>2</SUB>-induced RTN neuronal activation were strongly blunted, with no effect on hypoxia-stimulated breathing. In brainstem slices from GPR4(H81F) mice, peak firing of RTN neurons during bath acidification was significantly reduced compared with GPR4 wild-type mice, and a subpopulation of RTN neurons was rendered pH-insensitive, phenocopying previous results from GPR4-deleted mice. These effects were independent of changes in RTN number/distribution, neuronal excitability or transcript levels for GPR4 and TASK-2. CO<SUB>2</SUB>-stimulated breathing was reduced to a similar extent in GPR4(H81F) and TASK-2-deleted mice, with combined mutation yielding no additional deficit in the HCVR. Together, these data demonstrate that the intrinsic pH sensitivity of GPR4 is necessary for full elaboration of the HCVR.</p>

                <p>Acetylation of histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and the resultant change in gene expression, is a well-established mechanism necessary for long-term memory (LTM) consolidation, which is not required for short-term memory (STM). However, we previously demonstrated that the HAT p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) also influences hippocampus (HPC)-dependent STM in male rats. In addition to their epigenetic activity, HATs acetylate nonhistone proteins involved in nongenomic cellular processes, such as estrogen receptors (ERs). Given that ERs have rapid, nongenomic effects on HPC-dependent STM, we investigated the potential interaction between ERs and PCAF for STM mediated by the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). Using a series of pharmacological agents administered directly into the dHPC, we reveal a functional interaction between PCAF and ER&alpha; in the facilitation of short-term object-in-place memory in male but not female rats. This interaction was specific to ER&alpha;, while ER&beta; agonism did not enhance STM. It was further specific to dHPC STM, as the effect was not present in the dHPC for LTM or in the perirhinal cortex. Further, while STM required local (i.e., dHPC) estrogen synthesis, the facilitatory interaction effect appeared independent of estrogens. Finally, western blot analyses demonstrated that PCAF activation in the dHPC rapidly (5 min) activated downstream estrogen-related cell signaling kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase). Collectively, these findings indicate that PCAF, which is typically implicated in LTM through epigenetic processes, also influences STM in the dHPC, possibly via nongenomic ER activity. Critically, this novel PCAF&ndash;ER interaction might exist as a male-specific mechanism supporting STM.</p>

                <p>While the influence of context on long-term memory (LTM) is well documented, its effects on the interaction between working memory (WM) and LTM remain less understood. In this study, we explored these interactions using a delayed match-to-sample task, where participants (6 males, 16 females) encountered the same target object across six consecutive trials, facilitating the transition from WM to LTM. During half of these target repetitions, the background color changed. We measured the WM storage of the target using the contralateral delay activity in electroencephalography. Our results reveal that task-irrelevant context changes trigger the reactivation of long-term memories in WM. This reactivation may be attributed to content&ndash;context binding in WM and hippocampal pattern separation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0179-24.2024?rss=1">Not a Deficit, Just Different: Prepulse Inhibition Disruptions in Autism Depend on Startle Stimulus Intensities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory processing disruptions are a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological disorders. The acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition (PPI) are common metrics used to assess disruptions in sensory processing and sensorimotor gating in clinical studies and animal models. However, often there are inconsistent findings on ASD-related PPI deficits across different studies. Here, we used a novel method for assessing changes in startle and PPI in rodents, using the <I>Cntnap2</I> knock-out (KO) rat model for neurodevelopmental disorder/ASD that has consistently shown PPI disruptions in past studies. We discovered that not only sex and prepulse intensity but also the intensity of the startle stimulus profoundly impacts whether PPI deficits are evident in the <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rat or not. We show that rats do not universally exhibit a PPI deficit; instead, impaired PPI is contingent on specific testing conditions. Notably, at lower startle stimulus intensities, <I>Cntnap2</I> KO rats not only demonstrated intact PPI but also exhibited evidence of enhanced PPI compared with their wild-type counterparts. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering specific testing conditions when evaluating startle and PPI in the context of ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions and might explain some of the inconsistencies between different studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0242-24.2024?rss=1">Aperiodic Activity Indexes Neural Hyperexcitability in Generalized Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Generalized epilepsy (GE) encompasses a heterogeneous group of hyperexcitability disorders that clinically manifest as seizures. At the whole-brain level, distinct seizure patterns as well as interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) reflect key signatures of hyperexcitability in magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) recordings. Moreover, it had been suggested that aperiodic activity, specifically the slope of the 1/<I>f<sup>x</sup></I> decay function of the power spectrum, might index neural excitability. However, it remained unclear if hyperexcitability as encountered at the cellular level directly translates to putative large-scale excitability signatures, amenable to M/EEG. In order to test whether the power spectrum is altered in hyperexcitable states, we recorded resting-state MEG from male and female GE patients (<I>n</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;51; 29 females; 28.82 &plusmn; 12.18&nbsp;years; mean &plusmn; SD) and age-matched healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 49; 22 females; 32.10 &plusmn; 12.09&nbsp;years). We parametrized the power spectra using FOOOF ("fitting oscillations and one over <I>f</I>") to separate oscillatory from aperiodic activity to directly test whether aperiodic activity is systematically altered in GE patients. We further identified IEDs to quantify the temporal dynamics of aperiodic activity around overt epileptic activity. The results demonstrate that aperiodic activity indexes hyperexcitability in GE at the whole-brain level, especially during epochs when no IEDs were present (<I>p</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0130; <I>d</I> = 0.52). Upon IEDs, large-scale circuits transiently shifted to a less excitable network state (<I>p</I> = 0.001; <I>d</I> = 0.68). In sum, these results uncover that MEG background activity might index hyperexcitability based on the current brain state and does not rely on the presence of epileptic waveforms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0357-23.2024?rss=1">Different Sensory Information Is Used for State Estimation when Stationary or Moving</a></h4>

              
                <p>The accurate estimation of limb state is necessary for movement planning and execution. While state estimation requires both feedforward and feedback information, we focus here on the latter. Prior literature has shown that integrating visual and proprioceptive feedback improves estimates of static limb position. However, differences in visual and proprioceptive feedback delays suggest that multisensory integration could be disadvantageous when the limb is moving. We formalized this hypothesis by modeling feedback-based state estimation using the long-standing maximum likelihood estimation model of multisensory integration, which we updated to account for sensory delays. Our model predicted that the benefit of multisensory integration was largely lost when the limb was passively moving. We tested this hypothesis in a series of experiments in human subjects that compared the degree of interference created by discrepant visual or proprioceptive feedback when estimating limb position either statically at the end of the movement or dynamically at movement midpoint. In the static case, we observed significant interference: discrepant feedback in one modality systematically biased sensory estimates based on the other modality. However, no interference was seen in the dynamic case: participants could ignore sensory feedback from one modality and accurately reproduce the motion indicated by the other modality. Together, these findings suggest that the sensory feedback used to compute a state estimate differs depending on whether the limb is stationary or moving. While the former may tend toward multimodal integration, the latter is more likely to be based on feedback from a single sensory modality.</p>
