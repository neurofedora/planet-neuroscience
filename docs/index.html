              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Spike Protein-independent Attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Laboratory Mice</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is known to be attenuated in laboratory animals. Liu et.al. here report that the Omicron variant spike protein enables virus to infect laboratory mice via its interaction with mouse ACE2. The attenuation of Omicron in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, however, is attributed to mutations outside the spike region.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Linking neuronal and hemodynamic network signatures in the resting human brain</a></h4>

              
                Despite several studies investigating the relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and neuroelectric activity, our understanding is rather incomplete. For instance, the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) is commonly used, regardless of brain region, frequency of electric activity and functional networks. We studied this relationship between BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) signal of the human brain in detail using simultaneous fMRI and EEG in healthy awake human subjects at rest. Signals from EEG sensors were filtered into different frequency bands and projected into three-dimensional source space. The correlation of the time courses of the two modalities were quantified on a voxel-by-voxel basis on full-brain level as well as separately for each resting state network, with different temporal shifts and EEG frequency bands. We found highly significant correlations between the BOLD-fMRI signal and simultaneously measured EEG, yet with varying time-lags for different frequency bands and different resting state networks. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations with a much longer delay in the fMRI BOLD signal. The positive correlations were mostly around 6-8 seconds delayed in the BOLD time course while the negative correlations were noticed with a BOLD offset of around 20 to 26 seconds. These positive and negative correlation patterns included the commonly reported alpha and gamma bands but also extend in other frequency bands giving characteristic profiles for different resting state networks. Our results confirm recent works that suggest that the relationship between the two modalities is rather brain region / network-specific than a global function and suggest that applying a global canonical HRF for electrophysiological data is probably insufficient to account for the different spatial and temporal dynamics of different brain networks. Moreover, our results suggest that the HRF also varies in different frequency bands giving way to further studies investigating cross-frequency coupling and its interplay with resting state networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Boosting of neural circuit chaos at the onset of collective oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical networks exhibit highly irregular spiking activity to repeated stimuli. One source of such variability is network chaos, ever-present in spiking network models. In order to reliably and robustly represent and transmit information, cortical networks must implement active mechanisms to quench undesired changes in spiking patterns. Neuronal oscillations have been proposed as a mechanism to flexibly gate information flow across the cortex, but whether these collective rhythms would actually contribute to quenching spiking unreliability and tame network chaos by synchronizing activity, or on the contrary, intensify chaos by acting as a common drive to the network, is not easily predictable. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of network models with respect to two known control parameters regulating collective oscillatory activity: delayed recurrent inhibition and an external periodic drive. To do so, we advanced the tractability of large spiking networks of exactly solvable neuronal models by developing a strategy that allows for exact characterization of the dynamics on the attractor of effectively delayed network models in a system with fixed and finite degrees of freedom. We find that, below the transition to collective oscillations, neuronal networks have a stereotypical dependence on the delay so far only described for scalar systems and low-dimensional maps. We demonstrate that the emergence of internally generated oscillations induces a complete dynamical reconfiguration, by increasing the dimensionality of the chaotic attractor, the speed at which nearby trajectories separate from one another, and the rate at which the network produces entropy. Our results suggest that simple temporal dynamics of the mean activity can have a profound effect on the structure of the spiking patterns and therefore on the information processing capability of neuronal networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging Differentially Affects Axonal Autophagosome Formation and Maturation</a></h4>

              
                Misregulation of neuronal autophagy has been implicated in age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. We compared autophagosome formation and maturation in primary murine neurons during development and through aging to elucidate how aging affects neuronal autophagy. We observed an age-related decrease in the rate of formation of LC3B-positive autophagosomes leading to a significant decrease in the density of autophagosomes along the axon. Next, we assessed the maturation of autophagic vesicles and identified a surprising increase in their maturation in neurons from aged mice. While we did not detect notable changes in endolysosomal content in the distal axon during aging, we found that autophagic vesicles were transported more efficiently in neurons from adult mice than in neurons from young mice. This efficient transport of autophagic vesicles in both the distal and proximal axon is maintained in neurons from aged mice and indicates that aging alone does not impair transport nor negatively impact the later stages of autophagy. However, the pronounced deficit in autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons may contribute to a decreased capacity to clear aggregated proteins or dysfunctional organelles and thus contribute to age-related degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors in the gustatory cortex influence food intake</a></h4>

              
                The gustatory region of the insular cortex (GC) processes taste information in manners important for taste-guided behaviors, including food intake itself. In addition to oral gustatory stimuli, GC activity is also influenced by physiological states including hunger. The specific cell-types and molecular mechanisms that afford with GC with such influences on food intake are unclear. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by neurons in the brain whereafter it can act upon GLP-1 receptor-expressing (GLP-1R+) neurons found in several brain regions. In these brain regions, GLP-1R agonism suppresses homeostatic food intake and dampens the hedonic value of food. Here, we report in mice of both sexes that cells within the GC express GLP-1R mRNA and further, by ex vivo brain slice recordings, that GC GLP-1R+ neurons are depolarized by the selective GLP-1R agonist, exendin-4 (Ex-4). Next we found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ neurons, and also pharmacological stimulation of GC-GLP-1Rs themselves, both reduced homeostatic food intake. When maintained on a high-fat diet, obese mice exhibited impaired food intake responses when Ex-4 was administered into the GC. Yet, when obese mice were switched to a low-fat diet, the effect of GC Ex-4 was restored, indicating that GC GLP-1R influences may depend upon palatability of the food. Together, these results provide evidence for a specific cell population in the GC which may hold roles in both homeostatic and hedonic food intake.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural excitability induces time-dependent overlap of memory engrams</a></h4>

              
                Memories are thought to be stored in neural ensembles known as engrams that are specifically reactivated during memory recall. Recent studies have found that memory engrams of two events that happened close in time tend to overlap in the hippocampus and the amygdala, and these overlaps have been shown to support memory linking. It has been hypothesised that engram overlaps arise from the mechanisms that regulate memory allocation itself, involving neural excitability, but the exact process remains unclear. Indeed, most theoretical studies focus on synaptic plasticity and little is known about the role of intrinsic plasticity, which could be mediated by neural excitability and serve as a complementary mechanism for forming memory engrams. Here, we developed a rate-based recurrent neural network that includes both synaptic plasticity and neural excitability. We obtained structural and functional overlap of memory engrams for contexts that are presented close in time, consistent with experimental studies. Moreover, we showed that enhancing the initial excitability of a subset of neurons just before presenting a context biases the memory allocation to these neurons. We then explored the role of inhibition as a way of controlling competition among neurons from two ensembles. This work suggests mechanisms underlying the role of intrinsic excitability in memory allocation and linking, and yields predictions regarding the dynamics of memory engrams.

	<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal aging and probable Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. It is of great value to screen for MCI in the community. A novel machine learning (ML) model is composed of electroencephalography (EEG), eye tracking (ET), and neuropsychological assessments. This study has been proposed to identify MCI subjects from normal controls (NC). Methods: Two cohorts were used in this study. Cohort 1 as the training and validation group, includes184 MCI patients and 152 NC subjects. Cohort 2 as an independent test group, includes 44 MCI and 48 NC individuals. EEG, ET, Neuropsychological Tests Battery (NTB), and clinical variables with age, gender, educational level, MoCA-B, and ACE-R were selected for all subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to evaluate the capabilities of this tool to classify MCI from NC. The clinical model, the EEG and ET model, and the neuropsychological model were compared. Results: We found that the classification accuracy of the proposed model achieved 84.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.43% and 88.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.59% in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of the proposed tool achieved 0.941 (0.893&amp;amp;ndash;0.982) in Cohort 1 and 0.966 (0.921&amp;amp;ndash;0.988) in Cohort 2, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed model incorporation of EEG, ET, and neuropsychological assessments yielded excellent classification performances, suggesting its potential for future application in cognitive decline prediction.</p>

	<p>A cochlear implant (CI) is currently the only FDA-approved biomedical device that can restore hearing for the majority of patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). While prelingually and postlingually deaf individuals benefit substantially from CI, the outcomes after implantation vary greatly. Numerous studies have attempted to study the variables that affect CI outcomes, including the personal characteristics of CI candidates, environmental variables, and device-related variables. Up to 80% of the results remained unexplainable because all these variables could only roughly predict auditory performance with a CI. Brain structure/function differences after hearing deprivation, that is, cortical reorganization, has gradually attracted the attention of neuroscientists. The cross-modal reorganization in the auditory cortex following deafness is thought to be a key factor in the success of CI. In recent years, the adaptive and maladaptive effects of this reorganization on CI rehabilitation have been argued because the neural mechanisms of how this reorganization impacts CI learning and rehabilitation have not been revealed. Due to the lack of brain processes describing how this plasticity affects CI learning and rehabilitation, the adaptive and deleterious consequences of this reorganization on CI outcomes have recently been the subject of debate. This review describes the evidence for different roles of cross-modal reorganization in CI performance and attempts to explore the possible reasons. Additionally, understanding the core influencing mechanism requires taking into account the cortical changes from deafness to hearing restoration. However, methodological issues have restricted longitudinal research on cortical function in CI. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been increasingly used for the study of brain function and language assessment in CI because of its unique advantages, which are considered to have great potential. Here, we review studies on auditory cortex reorganization in deaf patients and CI recipients, and then we try to illustrate the feasibility of fNIRS as a neuroimaging tool in predicting and assessing speech performance in CI recipients. Here, we review research on the cross-modal reorganization of the auditory cortex in deaf patients and CI recipients and seek to demonstrate the viability of using fNIRS as a neuroimaging technique to predict and evaluate speech function in CI recipients.</p>

	<p>It has been well established that very-high-altitude (&amp;amp;gt;4000 m) environments can affect human cognitive function and brain activity. However, the effects of long-term exposure to moderate altitudes (2000&amp;amp;ndash;3000 m) on cognitive function and brain activity are not well understood. In the present cross-sectional study, we utilized an N-back working memory task and resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude on working memory and resting-state brain activity in 208 college students, compared with a control group at the sea level. The results showed that there was no significant change in spatial working memory performance after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. In contrast, the analysis of resting-state brain activity revealed changes in functional connectivity patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased after two years of exposure to 2260 m altitude. These results suggest that long-term exposure to moderate altitudes has no observable effect on spatial working memory performance, while significant changes in functional connectivity and brain network properties could possibly occur to compensate for the effects of mild hypoxic environments. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the resting state activity in the PFC associated with working memory in people exposed to moderate altitudes.</p>

	<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are complex disorders which can be associated with many comorbidities and exhibit multifactorial-dependent phenotypes. An important characteristic is represented by the early onset of the symptoms, during childhood or young adulthood, with a great impact on the socio-cognitive functioning of the affected individuals. Thus, the aim of our review is to describe and to argue the necessity of early developmental stages zebrafish models, focusing on NDDs, especially autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and also on schizophrenia. The utility of the animal models in NDDs or schizophrenia research remains quite controversial. Relevant discussions can be opened regarding the specific characteristics of the animal models and the relationship with the etiologies, physiopathology, and development of these disorders. The zebrafish models behaviors displayed as early as during the pre-hatching embryo stage (locomotor activity prone to repetitive behavior), and post-hatching embryo stage, such as memory, perception, affective-like, and social behaviors can be relevant in ASD and schizophrenia research. The neurophysiological processes impaired in both ASD and schizophrenia are generally highly conserved across all vertebrates. However, the relatively late individual development and conscious social behavior exhibited later in the larval stage are some of the most important limitations of these model animal species.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural oscillations in the aging brain associated with interference control in word production</a></h4>

              
                Speaking is not only about retrieving words and structuring them into sentences, but it also requires top-down control to plan and execute speech. In previous electrophysiological research with young-adult speakers, mid-frontal theta oscillations have been observed using a picture-word interference paradigm. With this paradigm, participants name pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor words. In particular, mid-frontal theta power increases for categorically related distractors relative to other types of distractors, reflecting the top-down interference control in resolving the competition between processing streams during word production (Piai, Roelofs, Jensen, Schoffelen, & Bonnefond, 2014). In the present study, we conceptually replicated the magnetoencephalography study by Piai et al. (2014) with an older group of healthy adults (mean age of 60 years). Behaviorally, we replicated distractor semantic interference and Stroop-like interference effects usually observed in young adults. However, we did not find the corresponding theta modulation associated with these interference effects on the neural level. Instead, we found beta power decreases for both effects, mostly pronounced in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The distinct spectro-spatial-temporal profile of the oscillatory effects in the older population suggests different underlying dynamics relative to the midline frontal effect previously found in young-adult speakers. Our results indicate that the neural underpinnings of top-down interference control may be modified by aging, and that the mid-frontal theta cannot be the exclusive mechanism enabling interference control during spoken word production.

                Cocaine abuse during adolescence increases the risk for developing drug addiction in later life, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, adolescent cocaine-exposed (ACE) male mice models were established by giving once-daily intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg cocaine to mice during adolescence (P28-P42). We found that ACE mice exhibited a higher sensitivity to subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg) in adulthood, accompanied with triggered activities and dendritic spine density of pyramidal neuron, increased Dusp1 gene, as well as reduced protein levels and activity of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in mPFC. Specific overexpression of DUSP1 on mPFC glutamatergic neurons efficiently blocked cocaine-preferred behaviors and reduced mPFC activity, while knockdown of DUSP1 maintained cocaine-preferred behaviors and increased mPFC activity in ACE mice. MAPK-related signals, especially ERK1/2, might underlie the mediating effects of DUSP1. Collectively, these findings suggested that targeting mPFC DUSP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and attenuation of addiction susceptibility, particularly in addicts with a history of adolescent drugs exposure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uman Type NF-L Antibodies Are Effective Reagents for the Imaging of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Recent work shows that certain immunological assays for the neurofilament light chain NF-L detect informative signals in the CSF and blood of human and animals affected by a variety of CNS injury and disease states. Much of this work has been performed using two mouse monoclonal antibodies to NF-L, UD1 and UD2, also known as 2.1 and 47.3 respectively. These are the essential components of the Uman Diagnostics NF-Light ELISA kit, the Quanterix Simoa bead based NF-L assay and others. We show here that the antibodies bind to neighboring epitopes in a short, conserved and unusual peptide in the NF-L "rod" Coil 2 region. We also describe a surprising and useful feature of Uman and similar reagents. While other well characterized NF-L antibodies show robust staining of countless cells and processes in CNS sections from healthy rats, both Uman antibodies reveal only a minor subset of presumably spontaneously degenerating or degenerated neurons and their processes. However following experimental mid-cervical injuries to rat spinal cord both Uman antibodies recognize numerous profiles in tissue sections. The Uman positive material was associated with fiber tracts expected to be damaged by the injury administered and the profiles had the swollen, beaded, discontinuous and sinusoidal morphology expected for degenerating and degenerated processes. We also found that several antibodies to the C terminal "tail" region of NF-L stain undamaged axonal profiles but fail to recognize the Uman positive material. The unmasking of the Uman epitopes and the loss of the NF-L tail epitopes can be mimicked by treating sections from healthy animals with proteases suggesting that the immunological changes we have discovered are due to neurodegeneration induced proteolysis. We have also generated a novel panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents directed against the region of NF-L including the Uman epitopes which have staining properties identical to the Uman reagents. Using these we show that the NF-L region to which the Uman reagents bind contains further hidden epitopes distinct from those recognized by the two Uman reagents. We speculate that the Uman type epitopes are part of a binding region important for higher order neurofilament assembly. The work provides important insights into the properties of the NF-L biomarker, describes novel and useful properties of Uman type and NF-L tail binding antibodies and provides a hypothesis relevant to further understanding of neurofilament assembly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of lysosomal proteolysis in astrocytes facilitates midbrain proteostasis failure in an early-onset PD model.</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on biopolymers accompany cellular aging and drives poorly understood disease processes. Here, we studied how AGEs contribute to development of early on-set Parkinson's Disease (PD) caused by loss-of-function of DJ1, a protein deglycase. In induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain organoid models deficient for DJ1 activity, we find that lysosomal proteolysis is impaired, causing AGEs to accumulate, -synuclein (-syn) phosphorylation to increase, and proteins to aggregate. These processes are at least partly driven by astrocytes, as DJ1 loss reduces their capacity to provide metabolic support and triggers acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Consistently, in co-cultures, we find that DJ1-expressing astrocytes are able to reverse the proteolysis deficits of DJ1 knockout midbrain neurons. In conclusion, astrocytes' capacity to clear toxic damaged proteins is critical to preserve neuronal function and their dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.

                The ability of neurons to respond to external stimuli involves adaptations of gene expression. The transcription factor, {Delta}FOSB, is important for the development of drug addiction, however, its gene targets have not been identified. Here we use CUT&RUN to map the genome-wide enrichment of {Delta}FOSB binding in the two major neuronal cell types of the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region, after cocaine exposure. The binding landscape shows that the majority of {Delta}FOSB peaks occur outside of promoter regions, including intergenic regions, and are surrounded by epigenetic marks indicative of active enhancers. BRG1, the core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, overlaps with {Delta}FOSB peaks, consistent with earlier studies of {Delta}FOSB's interacting proteins. In addition, in silico analyses predict that {Delta}FOSB cooperatively regulates gene expression with homeobox and T-box transcription factors. These novel findings uncover key elements of {Delta}FOSB's molecular mechanisms in transcriptional regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal brain age estimates relate to Alzheimer disease biomarkers and cognition in early stages: a cross-sectional observational study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Estimates of "brain-predicted age" quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), but has not been well explored in preclinical AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored. Methods: We trained three models to predict age from FC, volumetric (Vol), or multimodal MRI (Vol+FC) in 390 control participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 older adult controls, 154 preclinical AD participants, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as a global cognitive composite. Results: All models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were marginally reduced in preclinical AD participants compared to controls. In CI participants only, elevated Vol-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance. Conclusions: Both FC-BAG and Vol-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and volumetric MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to preclinical AD pathology, while Vol-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model captures these modality-specific patterns, and further, improves sensitivity to healthy age differences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tracking neural correlates of prioritizing working memory representations through retrospective attentional strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has proposed two potentials benefits of retrospective attention on working memory (WM): target strengthening and non-target inhibition. It remains unknown which hypothesis contributes to the improved WM performance, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this attentional benefit are unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while 33 participants performed a retrospective-cue WM task. Multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that only representations of target features were enhanced by valid retrospective attention during the retention, supporting the target strengthening hypothesis. Further univariate analysis found that mid-frontal theta inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and ERP components were modulated by valid retrospective attention and correlated with individual differences and moment-to-moment fluctuations on behavioral outcomes, suggesting that both trait- and state-level variability in attentional preparatory processes influence goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, task-irrelevant target spatial location could be decoded from EEG signals, indicating that enhanced spatial binding of target representation promotes high WM precision. Importantly, frontoparietal theta-alpha phase-amplitude-coupling was increased by valid retrospective attention and predicted the reduced randomly guessing rates. This long-range connection supported top-down information flow in engagement of frontoparietal networks, which might organize attentional states to integrate target features. Altogether, these results provide neurophysiological bases that retrospective attention improves WM precision through enhancing representation of target and emphasize the critical role of frontoparietal attentional network in the control of WM representations.

	<p>Purpose: To examine the optical coherence tomography (OCT) features of the retina in patients with chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION) and compare them with those of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with and without optic neuritis (ON), and healthy controls (HC). Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used spectral domain OCT to evaluate the retinal structure of 14 participants with CRION, 22 with NMOSD, 40 with RRMS with unilateral ON, and 20 HC. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), total macular volume (TMV), and papillomacular bundle (PMB) were measured, and intra-retinal segmentation was performed to obtain the retinal nerve fiber (RNFL), ganglion cell (GCL), inner plexiform (IPL), inner nuclear (INL), outer plexiform (OPL) and outer nuclear (ONL) layer volumes. Results: The global pRNFL [39.33(&amp;amp;plusmn;1.8) &amp;amp;micro;m] and all its quadrants are significantly thinner in CRION compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). CRION patients have decreased volumes of TMV, RNFL, GCL, and IPL compared with all other groups (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Severe thinning in pRNFL and thinning in intra-retinal segments of IPL, GCL, RNFL, and TMV could be helpful in differentiating CRION from NMOSD and RRMS.</p>

	<p>Neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders are characterized by a great diversity of clinical symptoms and underlying neuropathology, yet differential diagnosis during lifetime remains probabilistic. Molecular imaging is a powerful method to detect pathological changes in vivo on a cellular and molecular level with high specificity. Thereby, molecular imaging enables to investigate functional changes and pathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative disorders, thus allowing to better differentiate between different forms of degenerative parkinsonism, improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and disentangle the pathophysiology of disease-related symptoms. The past decade led to significant progress in the field of molecular imaging, including the development of multiple new and promising radioactive tracers for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as novel analytical methods. Here, we review the most recent advances in molecular imaging for the diagnosis, prognosis, and mechanistic understanding of parkinsonian disorders. First, advances in imaging of neurotransmission abnormalities, metabolism, synaptic density, inflammation, and pathological protein aggregation are reviewed, highlighting our renewed understanding regarding the multiplicity of neurodegenerative processes involved in parkinsonian disorders. Consequently, we review the role of molecular imaging in the context of disease-modifying interventions to follow neurodegeneration, ensure stratification, and target engagement in clinical trials.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and median survival is relatively short despite aggressive standard treatment. Natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction is strongly associated with tumor recurrence and metastasis but is unclear in glioblastoma. NK activity (NKA) represents NK cell-secreted interferon-&amp;amp;gamma; (IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;), which modulates immunity and inhibits cancer progression. This study aimed to analyze NKA in glioblastoma patients to obtain a clearer overview of immunity surveillance. From 2020 to 2021, a total of 20 patients and six healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 3 and 30. Then, NKA was measured using the NK VUE kit. Although NKA decreased on POD3, it recovered and further significantly enhanced on POD30, with a nearly five-fold increase compared to baseline (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK cells decreased significantly on POD3 (p = 0.022) and further recovered on PO30. Subgroup analysis of extent surgical resection further revealed that the recovery of impaired NKA was attributable to gross total resection (GTR) rather than subtotal resection (STR). In conclusion, NKA is significantly impaired in glioblastoma, and GTR has demonstrated superior benefit in improving the suppressed NKA and increased CD56brightCD16&amp;amp;minus; NK subset in glioblastoma patients, which may be associated with subsequent patients&amp;amp;rsquo; prognosis. Therefore, the goal of performing GTR for glioblastoma should be achieved when possible since it appears to increase NKA cell immunity.</p>

	<p>Due to the complexity of medical imaging techniques and the high heterogeneity of glioma surfaces, image segmentation of human gliomas is one of the most challenging tasks in medical image analysis. Current methods based on convolutional neural networks concentrate on feature extraction while ignoring the correlation between local and global. In this paper, we propose a residual mix transformer fusion net, namely RMTF-Net, for brain tumor segmentation. In the feature encoder, a residual mix transformer encoder including a mix transformer and a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed. The mix transformer gives an overlapping patch embedding mechanism to cope with the loss of patch boundary information. Moreover, a parallel fusion strategy based on RCNN is utilized to obtain local&amp;amp;ndash;global balanced information. In the feature decoder, a global feature integration (GFI) module is applied, which can enrich the context with the global attention feature. Extensive experiments on brain tumor segmentation from LGG, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 demonstrated that our proposed RMTF-Net is superior to existing state-of-art methods in subjective visual performance and objective evaluation.</p>

	<p>Background: Moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise programs have proven to exert positive effects on the cognitive performance of older people. However, the specific effects sport-based exercise programs have on cognitive performance, upon executive functions, remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults, through a systematic review protocol of the scientific literature, with a meta-analysis. Methods: The search was performed in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO electronic databases by combining keywords and different medical subject headings (MeSH) to identify and evaluate the relevant studies from inception up until June 2022. This study considers longitudinal studies with at least one experimental group and pre- and post-intervention measurements involving healthy older adults of 60 years of age or older. Studies have to consider one or more measures of executive function, including dimensions of working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility, in order to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this report. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale was used for methodological quality assessment studies. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to compute the meta-analyses and report effect sizes (ES, i.e., Hedges&amp;amp;rsquo; g) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and a statistical significance set at p &amp;amp;le; 0.05. The ES values were calculated for executive function globally and for each dimension of executive function (e.g., working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility) in the experimental and control/comparator groups using the mean and standard deviation values before and after the intervention period. Conclusions: Our systematic review aims to clarify the effects of sport-based exercise programs on executive functions in older adults. The results may help practitioners and stakeholders to provide better evidence-based decisions regarding sport-based exercise program implementation for older adults, and to help them to optimize cognitive functions during the aging process. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42022284788).</p>

	<p>Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) expression is decreased in conditions associated with cognitive decline as well as metabolic diseases. One potential strategy to improve metabolic health and elevate BDNF is by increasing circulating ketones. Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) stimulates BDNF expression, but the association of circulating BHB and plasma BDNF in humans has not been widely studied. Here, we present results from three studies that evaluated how various methods of inducing ketosis influenced plasma BDNF in humans. Study 1 determined BDNF responses to a single bout of high-intensity cycling after ingestion of a dose of ketone salts in a group of healthy adults who were habitually consuming either a mixed diet or a ketogenic diet. Study 2 compared how a ketogenic diet versus a mixed diet impacts BDNF levels during a 12-week resistance training program in healthy adults. Study 3 examined the effects of a controlled hypocaloric ketogenic diet, with and without daily use of a ketone-salt, on BDNF levels in overweight/obese adults. We found that (1) fasting plasma BDNF concentrations were lower in keto-adapted versus non keto-adapted individuals, (2) intense cycling exercise was a strong stimulus to rapidly increase plasma BDNF independent of ketosis, and (3) clinically significant weight loss was a strong stimulus to decrease fasting plasma BDNF independent of diet composition or level of ketosis. These results highlight the plasticity of plasma BDNF in response to lifestyle factors but does not support a strong association with temporally matched BHB concentrations.</p>

	<p>Objective: Recently, many emotional diseases, such as anxiety and depression, have prevailed, and it is expected that emotional disease will be the leading cause of social and economic burden in 2030. These emotional diseases may be due to certain personality traits, which could be the reasons for the development of mental illness. Personality theories have been constantly developed over the past hundreds of years, and different dimensions of personality traits corresponding to different physiological bases and emotional feelings have been proposed. However, personality may be the least studied area in psychology. Methods: In this paper, we will give a short review on the development of personality theories as well as dimensional emotional theory. Then, we will compare the similarities between the emotional dimension and personality dimension. Furthermore, we will also investigate the neural mechanisms of personality and emotions, focusing on neuromodulators for anxiety-related personality traits, in order to provide a clear relationship between different neurotransmitters and anxiety-related personality traits. Results: The results of our study suggest that the emotional dimension and personality dimension may be somewhat related, for example, the extrovert/introvert dimension of personality might be related to the hedonic dimension, which includes happiness/sadness, and the neurotic dimensions might be related to emotional arousal. In addition, our study found that personality traits are also related to basic emotions, for instance, people who are too self-centered are prone to feeling a mood of disgust or depression, while anger and fear correspond to unstable personality traits. The analysis suggested that the neural substrates of both personality and emotions might be described as follows: extroverted&amp;amp;ndash;joy&amp;amp;ndash;dopamine (DA); introverted&amp;amp;ndash;disgust&amp;amp;ndash;5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT); unstable (neuroticism)&amp;amp;ndash;anger/fear&amp;amp;ndash;noradrenaline (NE); stable&amp;amp;ndash;calmness. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that there is a correlation between personality traits and emotions, and both depend on monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin). In addition, personality disorders can be interfered via the regulation of emotions and neurotransmitters. This paper opens up a whole new perspective for future research on personality traits and emotional diseases and has great clinical value and practical significance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dscam1 Has Diverse Neuron Type-Specific Functions in the Developing Drosophila CNS</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Two key features endow <I>Drosophila</I> Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dscam1) with the potential to provide a ubiquitous code for neuronal arbor self-avoidance. First, Dscam1 contains three large cassettes of alternative exons, so that stochastic alternative splicing yields 19,008 Dscam1 isoforms with different Ig ectodomains. Second, each neuron expresses a different subset of Dscam1 isoforms, and isoform-specific homophilic binding causes repulsion. This results in even spacing of self-arbors, while processes of other neurons can intermingle and share the same synaptic partners. In principle, this Dscam1 code could ensure arbor spacing of all neurons in <I>Drosophila</I>. This model is strongly supported by studies on dendrite spacing in the peripheral nervous system and studies on axonal branch segregation during brain development. However, the situation is less clear for central neuron dendrites, the major substrate for synaptic input in the CNS. We systematically tested the role of Dscam1 for dendrite growth and spacing in eight different types of identified central neurons. Knockdown of Dscam1 causes severe dendritic clumping and length reductions in efferent glutamatergic and aminergic neurons. The primary cause for these dendritic phenotypes could be impaired self-avoidance, a growth defect, or both. In peptidergic efferent neurons, many central arbors are not formed, arguing for a growth defect. By contrast, knockdown of Dscam1 does not affect dendrite growth or spacing in any of the five different types of interneurons tested. Axon arbor patterning is not affected in any neuron type tested. We conclude that Dscam1 mediates diverse, neuron type-specific functions during central neuron arbor differentiation.</p>

                Background: The replicative forms of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is found in several types of white blood cells within the host defense system. To determine the dimensionality of the extrahepatic manifestation of HBV in host white blood cells, it is important to understand the complete biology of its pathogenesis and lymphotropic nature. Methods: Deep curation of the literature from the PubMed database pertaining to the HBV manifestation in the human host white blood cells was conducted and then manually filtered to determine the behavioral trend of the virus within the human white blood cells. Results: The curation of 198 research articles identified 28 genes, 92 proteins, and 20 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells involved in HBV pathogenesis, while 20 immune cells were found to be permissive for the viral penetration and replication. The presence of the replicative forms of HBV in the host immune cells led to the further elucidation of 28 genes and 92 proteins that interact with one or more viral genes and proteins. Conclusions: A multi-dimensional analysis using deep curation identified a possible lymphotropic character of HBV. Moreover, there are certain pathways that could aid in the propagation of viral infection by using immune cells to its advantage. Thus, instead of eliminating HBV, the immune system may contribute to the population expansion of the virus.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of <i>Carollia perspicillata</i>, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of <i>Carollia</i>, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Learning‐related changes in cellular activity within mouse dentate gyrus during trace eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Because the dentate gyrus serves as the first site for information processing in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, it an important structure for the formation of associative memories. Previous findings in rabbit had recorded populations of cells within dentate gyrus that may bridge the temporal gap between stimuli to support memory formation during trace eyeblink conditioning, an associative learning task. However, this previous work was unable to identify the types of cells demonstrating this type of activity. To explore these changes further, we did in vivo single-neuron recording in conjunction with physiological determination of cell types to investigate the functional role of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus during learning. Tetrode recordings were performed in young-adult mice during training on trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent temporal associative memory task. Conditioned mice were able to successfully learn the task, with male mice learning at a faster rate than female mice. In the conditioned group, granule cells tended to show an increase in firing rate during conditioned stimulus presentation while mossy cells showed a decrease in firing rate during the trace interval and the unconditioned stimulus. Interestingly, populations of interneurons demonstrated learning-related increases and decreases in activity that began at onset of the conditioned stimulus and persisted through the trace interval. The current study also found a significant increase in theta power during stimuli presentation in conditioned animals, and this change in theta decreased over time. Ultimately, these data suggest unique involvement of granule cells, mossy cells, and interneurons in dentate gyrus in the formation of a trace associative memory. This work expands our knowledge of dentate gyrus function, helping to discern how aging and disease might disrupt this process.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RAFFT: Efficient prediction of RNA folding pathways using the fast Fourier transform</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vaitea Opuu, Nono S. C. Merleau, Vincent Messow, Matteo Smerlak</p>

We propose a novel heuristic to predict RNA secondary structure formation pathways that has two components: (i) a folding algorithm and (ii) a kinetic ansatz. This heuristic is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT starts by generating an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures, which is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches that find single structures with minimal free energies. When we constrained the algorithm to predict only 50 structures per sequence, near-native structures were found for RNA molecules of length ≤ 200 nucleotides. Our heuristic has been tested on the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE): an ensemble of 68 distinct structures allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. Thanks to the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT (RNA folding Algorithm wih Fast Fourier Transform) is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity O ( L 2logL ).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate climates: A Bayesian modelling study in 143 European regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomáš Gavenčiak, Joshua Teperowski Monrad, Gavin Leech, Mrinank Sharma, Sören Mindermann, Samir Bhatt, Jan Brauner, Jan Kulveit</p>

Although seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains unclear. While there is a sizable and growing literature on environmental drivers of COVID-19 transmission, recent reviews have highlighted conflicting and inconclusive findings. This indeterminacy partly owes to the fact that seasonal variation relates to viral transmission by a complicated web of causal pathways, including many interacting biological and behavioural factors. Since analyses of specific factors cannot determine the aggregate strength of seasonal forcing, we sidestep the challenge of disentangling various possible causal paths in favor of a holistic approach. We model seasonality as a sinusoidal variation in transmission and infer a single Bayesian estimate of the overall seasonal effect. By extending two state-of-the-art models of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) effects and their datasets covering 143 regions in temperate Europe, we are able to adjust our estimates for the role of both NPIs and mobility patterns in reducing transmission. We find strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-varying reproduction number <i>R</i>(<i>t</i>) (the expected number of new infections generated by an infectious individual at time <i>t</i>) of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7%—53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrative experimental/computational approach establishes active cellular protrusion as the primary driving force of phagocytic spreading by immune cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emmet A. Francis, Volkmar Heinrich</p>

The dynamic interplay between cell adhesion and protrusion is a critical determinant of many forms of cell motility. When modeling cell spreading on adhesive surfaces, traditional mathematical treatments often consider passive cell adhesion as the primary, if not exclusive, mechanistic driving force of this cellular motion. To better assess the contribution of active cytoskeletal protrusion to immune-cell spreading during phagocytosis, we here develop a computational framework that allows us to optionally investigate both purely adhesive spreading (“Brownian zipper hypothesis”) as well as protrusion-dominated spreading (“protrusive zipper hypothesis”). We model the cell as an axisymmetric body of highly viscous fluid surrounded by a cortex with uniform surface tension and incorporate as potential driving forces of cell spreading an attractive stress due to receptor-ligand binding and an outward normal stress representing cytoskeletal protrusion, both acting on the cell boundary. We leverage various model predictions against the results of a directly related experimental companion study of human neutrophil phagocytic spreading on substrates coated with different densities of antibodies. We find that the concept of adhesion-driven spreading is incompatible with experimental results such as the independence of the cell-spreading speed on the density of immobilized antibodies. In contrast, the protrusive zipper model agrees well with experimental findings and, when adapted to simulate cell spreading on discrete adhesion sites, it also reproduces the observed positive correlation between antibody density and maximum cell-substrate contact area. Together, our integrative experimental/computational approach shows that phagocytic spreading is driven by cellular protrusion, and that the extent of spreading is limited by the density of adhesion sites.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combining biomarker and virus phylogenetic models improves HIV-1 epidemiological source identification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Lundgren, Ethan Romero-Severson, Jan Albert, Thomas Leitner</p>

To identify and stop active HIV transmission chains new epidemiological techniques are needed. Here, we describe the development of a multi-biomarker augmentation to phylogenetic inference of the underlying transmission history in a local population. HIV biomarkers are measurable biological quantities that have some relationship to the amount of time someone has been infected with HIV. To train our model, we used five biomarkers based on real data from serological assays, HIV sequence data, and target cell counts in longitudinally followed, untreated patients with known infection times. The biomarkers were modeled with a mixed effects framework to allow for patient specific variation and general trends, and fit to patient data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Subsequently, the density of the unobserved infection time conditional on observed biomarkers were obtained by integrating out the random effects from the model fit. This probabilistic information about infection times was incorporated into the likelihood function for the transmission history and phylogenetic tree reconstruction, informed by the HIV sequence data. To critically test our methodology, we developed a coalescent-based simulation framework that generates phylogenies and biomarkers given a specific or general transmission history. Testing on many epidemiological scenarios showed that biomarker augmented phylogenetics can reach 90% accuracy under idealized situations. Under realistic within-host HIV-1 evolution, involving substantial within-host diversification and frequent transmission of multiple lineages, the average accuracy was at about 50% in transmission clusters involving 5–50 hosts. Realistic biomarker data added on average 16 percentage points over using the phylogeny alone. Using more biomarkers improved the performance. Shorter temporal spacing between transmission events and increased transmission heterogeneity reduced reconstruction accuracy, but larger clusters were not harder to get right. More sequence data per infected host also improved accuracy. We show that the method is robust to incomplete sampling and that adding biomarkers improves reconstructions of real HIV-1 transmission histories. The technology presented here could allow for better prevention programs by providing data for locally informed and tailored strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Wnt5a–Vangl1/2 signaling regulates the position and direction of lung branching through the cytoskeleton and focal adhesions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kuan Zhang, Erica Yao, Ethan Chuang, Biao Chen, Evelyn Y. Chuang, Regan F. Volk, Katherine L. Hofmann, Balyn Zaro, Pao-Tien Chuang</p>

Lung branching morphogenesis requires reciprocal interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. How the lung branches are generated at a defined location and projected toward a specific direction remains a major unresolved issue. In this study, we investigated the function of Wnt signaling in lung branching in mice. We discovered that <i>Wnt5a</i> in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme plays an essential role in controlling the position and direction of lung branching. The <i>Wnt5a</i> signal is mediated by <i>Vangl1/2</i> to trigger a cascade of noncanonical or planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. In response to noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling, lung cells undergo cytoskeletal reorganization and change focal adhesions. Perturbed focal adhesions in lung explants are associated with defective branching. Moreover, we observed changes in the shape and orientation of the epithelial sheet and the underlying mesenchymal layer in regions of defective branching in the mutant lungs. Thus, PCP signaling helps define the position and orientation of the lung branches. We propose that mechanical force induced by noncanonical <i>Wnt</i> signaling mediates a coordinated alteration in the shape and orientation of a group of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. These results provide a new framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which a stereotypic branching pattern is generated.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">HypDB: A functionally annotated web-based database of the proline hydroxylation proteome</a></h4>

Proline hydroxylation (Hyp) regulates protein structure, stability, and protein–protein interaction. It is widely involved in diverse metabolic and physiological pathways in cells and diseases. To reveal functional features of the Hyp proteome, we integrated various data sources for deep proteome profiling of the Hyp proteome in humans and developed HypDB (https://www.HypDB.site), an annotated database and web server for Hyp proteome. HypDB provides site-specific evidence of modification based on extensive LC-MS analysis and literature mining with 14,413 nonredundant Hyp sites on 5,165 human proteins including 3,383 Class I and 4,335 Class II sites. Annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of Hyp on key functional domains and tissue-specific distribution of Hyp abundance across 26 types of human organs and fluids and 6 cell lines. The network connectivity analysis further revealed a critical role of Hyp in mediating protein–protein interactions. Moreover, the spectral library generated by HypDB enabled data-independent analysis (DIA) of clinical tissues and the identification of novel Hyp biomarkers in lung cancer and kidney cancer. Taken together, our integrated analysis of human proteome with publicly accessible HypDB revealed functional diversity of Hyp substrates and provides a quantitative data source to characterize Hyp in pathways and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin drives development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice by affecting Th17 differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Katie J. Smith, Danielle Minns, Brian J. McHugh, Rebecca K. Holloway, Richard O’Connor, Anna Williams, Lauren Melrose, Rhoanne McPherson, Veronique E. Miron, Donald J. Davidson, Emily Gwyer Findlay</p>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly prevalent demyelinating autoimmune condition; the mechanisms regulating its severity and progression are unclear. The IL-17-producing Th17 subset of T cells has been widely implicated in MS and in the mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the differentiation and regulation of Th17 cells during EAE remain incompletely understood. Although evidence is mounting that the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin profoundly affects early T cell differentiation, no studies have looked at its role in longer-term T cell responses. Now, we report that cathelicidin drives severe EAE disease. It is released from neutrophils, microglia, and endothelial cells throughout disease; its interaction with T cells potentiates Th17 differentiation in lymph nodes and Th17 to exTh17 plasticity and IFN-γ production in the spinal cord. As a consequence, mice lacking cathelicidin are protected from severe EAE. In addition, we show that cathelicidin is produced by the same cell types in the active brain lesions in human MS disease. We propose that cathelicidin exposure results in highly activated, cytokine-producing T cells, which drive autoimmunity; this is a mechanism through which neutrophils amplify inflammation in the central nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Macrophages take up VLDL-sized emulsion particles through caveolae-mediated endocytosis and excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lei Deng, Frank Vrieling, Rinke Stienstra, Guido J. Hooiveld, Anouk L. Feitsma, Sander Kersten</p>

Triglycerides are carried in the bloodstream as part of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and chylomicrons, which represent the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants contribute to atherosclerosis, possibly by carrying remnant cholesterol and/or by exerting a proinflammatory effect on macrophages. Nevertheless, little is known about how macrophages process triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Here, using VLDL-sized triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, we aimed to study the mechanism by which VLDL triglycerides are taken up, processed, and stored in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage uptake of VLDL-sized emulsion particles is dependent on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain but not the catalytic N-terminal domain of LPL. Subsequent internalization of VLDL-sized emulsion particles by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase. It is shown that STARD3 is required for the transfer of lysosomal fatty acids to the ER for subsequent storage as triglycerides, while NPC1 likely is involved in promoting the extracellular efflux of fatty acids from lysosomes. Our data provide novel insights into how macrophages process VLDL triglycerides and suggest that macrophages have the remarkable capacity to excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids.

                Background: Hypertensive African Americans have a ~50% response rate to thiazide diuretic treatment. This contributes to a high prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Here, we examined the role of the mitochondrial genome on thiazide diuretic treatment response in hypertensive African Americans enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT, n= 4279) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Beadchip. Haplotype groups were called using HaploGrep. We used a linear regression analysis to examine the association between mitochondrial haplogroups (L, M, and N) and changes in blood pressure and fasting glucose over six months and two years, respectively. Results: The analysis revealed a null association between mitochondrial haplogroups M and N versus L for each of the outcomes. In subgroup analysis, the L subclades L1, L2, and L3/L4 (versus L0) were each inversely associated with fasting glucose response (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This discovery analysis suggests the mitochondrial genome has a small effect on fasting glucose response, but not that of blood pressure, to thiazide diuretic treatment in African Americans.

                Background: This paper unveils the role of security intelligence in facilitating the war against cybercrime in organizations. it introduces the term cybercrime and security intelligence with financial organizations in Nigeria. Since the invention of information and communication technology in Nigeria, citizens have become fascinated and engrossed. Unfortunately, this opened the door for people with malicious intent to attack individuals, organizations, and nations. Thus, this paper examines the problem of information vulnerability, identifies the level of cybercrime in financial entities, establishes the type of cybercrime, and assesses security intelligence awareness among staff and customers. Methods: The paper employed the simple-random sampling technique, using a primary and secondary source of information, analyzing frequency counts, percentages, and charts for the demographic variables, and used chi-square through SPSS data processing. Results: The results state the ubiquity of cybercrime among financial organizations and reveals that phishing scams, website spoofing, piracy, ransomware, and hacking are the top cyber-crime types commonly used. Conclusions: Thus, the administration of security intelligence can reduce internal and external threats in an organization. Furthermore, the paper states that security intelligence intervention is independent of the nature of cybercrime across the organization. However, the paper recommends that organizations need to enlighten their staff and customers with measures to safeguard information against cybercrime with the usage of security intelligence techniques and other proactive measures.

                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Generic model for biological regulation [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A substantial portion of molecules in an organism are involved in regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes. Several models have been presented for various forms of biological regulation, including gene expression regulation and physiological regulation; however, a generic model is missing. Recently a new unifying theory in biology, poikilosis, was presented.  Poikilosis indicates that all systems display intrinsic heterogeneity. The concept of poikilosis allowed development of a model for biological regulation applicable to all types of regulated systems. The perturbation-lagom-TATAR countermeasures-regulator (PLTR) model combines the effects of perturbation and lagom (allowed and sufficient extent of heterogeneity) in a system with tolerance, avoidance, repair, attenuation and resistance (TARAR) countermeasures, and possible regulators. There are three modes of regulation, two of which are lagom-related. In the first scenario, lagom is maintained, both intrinsic (passive) and active TARAR countermeasures can be involved. In the second mode, there is a shift from one lagom to another. In the third mode, reguland regulation, the regulated entity is the target of a regulatory shift, which is often irreversible or requires action of another regulator to return to original state. After the shift, the system enters to lagom maintenance mode, but at new lagom extent. The model is described and elaborated with examples and applications, including medicine and systems biology. Consequences of non-lagom extent of heterogeneity are introduced, along with a novel idea for therapy by reconstituting biological processes to lagom extent, even when the primary effect cannot be treated.

                <p>Author(s): Michael Vennettilli, Louis González, Nicholas Hilgert, and Andrew Mugler</p><p>The authors investigated the effect of cell density on the ability of cells to detect the direction of fluid flow by self-communication. They calculated the critical density at which this process of autologous chemotaxis fails and determined how the critical density depends on system parameters. Interestingly, they also found conditions in which the direction sensed by the cell is opposite to the flow.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.024413.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Following the surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the epicenter of East Java Province, this study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at one of the emergency field hospitals in Indonesia. Methods: This was a single-centered, retrospective descriptive study of 763 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Emergency Field Hospital of Bangkalan from July 5 2021 to September 30 2021. The demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, pre-existing comorbidities, therapy, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed using SPSS. Results: The clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the emergency hospital were varied. A total of 763 patients were included. The most common age was between 40 and 49 years (31.1%), a slight majority were women (51.5%), and most had travelled abroad in the last 14 days (99.1%). Of the 763 patients, 70.9% had no comorbidities. Half of the patients were asymptomatic (49.4%), 46% were mild cases, 4.1% were moderate, and 0.5% severe. The most common symptoms were productive cough (15.7%) and headache (15.3%). Supportive and comorbidity therapy were given which showed excellent clinical outcomes. Conclusions: This study presents the description of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during high surge cases of COVID-19 that are mostly dominated by Indonesian migrant workers in a field hospital. majority of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic and therapy without antibiotics or antivirals showed positive outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

To overcome these limitations, we used PCR-free Cas9-mediated nanopore sequencing to characterize <i>CNBP</i> repeat expansions at the single-nucleotide level in nine DM2 patients. The length of normal and expanded alleles can be assessed precisely using this strategy, agreeing with traditional methods, and revealing the degree of mosaicism. We also sequenced an entire ~50 kbp expansion, which has not been achieved previously for DM2 or any other repeat-expansion disorders. Our approach precisely counted the repeats and identified the repeat pattern for both short interrupted and uninterrupted alleles. Interestingly, in the expanded alleles, only two DM2 samples featured the expected pure CCTG repeat pattern, while the other seven presented also TCTG blocks at the 3′ end, which have not been reported before in DM2 patients, but confirmed hereby with orthogonal methods. The demonstrated approach simultaneously determines repeat length, structure/motif and the extent of somatic mosaicism, promising to improve the molecular diagnosis of DM2 and achieve more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the better stratification of DM2 patients in clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanism of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) revealed by targeted removal of legacy bisphosphonate from jawbone using equilibrium competing inert hydroxymethylene diphosphonate</a></h4>

              
                Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) presents as a morbid jawbone lesion in patients exposed to a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP). Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this anti-resorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in liposome-based deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesion. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved pro-inflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology is related to N-BP levels in jawbones and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insight on the mechanism of an electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase</a></h4>

              
                Electron-bifurcation is a fundamental energy conservation mechanism in nature in which two electrons from an intermediate potential electron donor are split so that one is sent along a high potential pathway to a high potential acceptor and the other is sent along a low potential pathway to a low potential acceptor. This process allows endergonic reactions to be driven by exergonic ones and is an alternative, less recognised, mechanism of energy coupling to the well-known chemiosmotic principle. The electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> (HydABC) requires both NADH and ferredoxin to reduce protons generating hydrogen. The mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC remains enigmatic in spite of intense research efforts over the last few years. Structural information may provide the basis for a better understanding of spectroscopic and functional information. Here, we present a 2.3 Å electron cryo-microscopy structure of HydABC. The structure shows a heterododecamer composed of two independent 'halves' each made of two strongly interacting HydABC heterotrimers connected via a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A central electron transfer pathway connects the active sites for NADH oxidation and for proton reduction. We identified two conformations of a flexible iron-sulfur cluster domain: a 'closed bridge' and an 'open bridge' conformation, where a Zn<sup>2+</sup> site may act as a 'hinge' allowing domain movement. Based on these structural revelations, we propose a possible mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC where the flavin mononucleotide serves a dual role as both the electron bifurcation center and as the NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction/NADH oxidation site.

                Microorganisms growing in their habitat constitute a complex system. How the individual constituents of the environment contribute to microbial growth remains largely unknown. The present study focused on the contribution of environmental constituents to population dynamics via a high-throughput assay and data-driven analysis of a wild-type <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain. A large dataset constituting a total of 12,828 bacterial growth curves with 966 medium combinations, which were composed of 44 pure chemical compounds, was acquired. Machine learning analysis of the big data relating the growth parameters to the medium combinations revealed that the decision-making components for bacterial growth were distinct among various growth phases, e.g., glucose, sulfate, and serine for maximum growth, growth rate, and growth delay, respectively. Further analyses and simulations indicated that branched-chain amino acids functioned as global coordinators for population dynamics, as well as a survival strategy of risk diversification to prevent the bacterial population from undergoing extinction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probabilistic axon targeting dynamics lead to individualized brain wiring</a></h4>

              
                Developmental variation in brain-wiring contributes to behavioural individuality1,2. However, how and when individualized wiring diagrams emerge and become stable during development remains largely unknown. Here, we explored axon targeting dynamics in individual brains using live-imaging of a developing Drosophila visual circuit and discovered that targeting choice is an algorithmic multi-step growth process with variable outcomes. Using optogenetics, we found that temporally restricted Notch lateral-inhibition defines a subset of neurons with a probabilistic potential to innervate distal targets. Next, axons from NotchOFF neurons amplify into long actin-rich multi-fibre structures necessary for distal growth. A subset of these NotchOFF neurons create distal targeting axons by stabilizing microtubule growth in one of their actin fibres. Amplified axons without tubulin-stabilized fibres retract, resulting in the stochastic selection of a different number of distal targeting axons in each brain. Pharmacological microtubule destabilization suffices to inhibit this targeting. We observed a similar axonal amplification-stabilization process in the developing chick spinal cord, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Finally, early microtubule patterns predict the adult brain- wiring of an individual in a target-independent manner prior to synapse formation3,4. Thus, we show that a temporal succession of genetically encoded stochastic processes explains the emergence of individual wiring variation.

                The relationship between brain areas based on neurotransmitter receptor and transporter molecule expression patterns may provide a link between brain structure and its function. Here, we studied the organization of the receptome, a measure of regional neurotransmitter receptor/transporter molecule (NTRM) similarity, derived from in vivo PET imaging studies of 19 different receptors and transporters. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed three main spatial gradients of receptor similarity in the cortex. The first gradient differentiated the somato-motor network from the remaining cortex. The second gradient spanned between temporo-occipital and frontal anchors, differentiating visual and limbic networks from attention and control networks, and the third receptome gradient was anchored between the occipital and temporal cortices. In subcortical structures, the receptome delineated a striato-thalamic axis, separating functional communities. Moreover, we observed similar organizational principles underlying receptome differentiation in cortex and subcortex, indicating a link between subcortical and cortical NTRM patterning. Overall, we found that the cortical receptome shared key organizational traits with brain structure and function. Node-level correspondence of receptor similarity to functional, microstructural, and diffusion MRI-based measures decreased along a primary-to-transmodal gradient. Compared to primary and paralimbic regions, we observed higher receptomic diversification in unimodal and heteromodal regions, possibly supporting functional flexibility. In sum, we show how receptor similarity may form an additional organizational layer of human brain architecture, bridging brain structure and function.

                Huntington Disease (HD) has been linked to reduced synthesis of cholesterol in the brain. Its exogenous delivery to the brain has been shown to be beneficial in the rapidly progressing R6/2 mouse model. Here we used an advanced formulation of brain-permeable nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with cholesterol and called hybrid-g7-NPs-chol, to explore the long-term therapeutical potential of cholesterol administration to the brain of the slow-progressing zQ175DN knock-in HD mouse model. We show that one cycle treatment with hybrid-g7-NPs-chol, administered in the pre-symptomatic or symptomatic phases, is sufficient to completely normalize cognitive defects up to 5 months, as well as to improve other behavioral and neuropathological parameters. Instead, two cycles of hybrid-g7-NPs-chol are needed to achieve long-lasting therapeutic benefits for 12 months without severe inflammatory side-effects. Sustained cholesterol delivery to the brain of zQ175DN mice also reduces mutant Huntingtin aggregates both in striatum and cortex and completely normalizes glutamatergic communication in the striatal medium spiny neurons compared to saline-treated HD mice. These results show that cholesterol delivery via brain-permeable NPs is a safe and versatile therapeutic option for lastingly reversing HD-related behavioral decline and neuropathological signs, highlighting the translational potential of cholesterol-based strategies in HD patients.

                High-level alcohol consumption causes neuroplastic changes in the brain that lead to negative affective and somatic symptoms when alcohol is withdrawn, promoting relapse drinking. We have some understanding of these plastic changes in defined brain circuits and cell types, but unbiased approaches are needed to explore broader patterns of adaptations. Here, we employed whole-brain c-fos mapping and network analysis to assess how brain-wide patterns of neuronal activity are altered during acute alcohol abstinence and reaccess in a well-characterized model of alcohol dependence. Mice underwent four cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) with alternating weeks of voluntary alcohol drinking, and a subset of mice underwent forced swim stress (FSS) prior to drinking sessions to further escalate alcohol consumption. After four CIE cycles, brains were collected from mice in each group either 24 hours (abstinence) or immediately following a one-hour period of alcohol reaccess. Brains from CIE mice during acute abstinence displayed widespread neuronal activation relative to those from AIR mice, independent of FSS, and this increase in c-fos was reversed by reaccess drinking. For network analysis, mice were then classified as high or low drinkers (HD or LD). We computed Pearson correlations for all pairs of brain regions and used graph theoretical methods to identify changes in network properties associated with high-drinking behavior. Network modularity, a measure of network segregation into communities, was increased in HD mice after alcohol reaccess relative to abstinence. Within-community strength and diversity measures were computed for each region and condition, and highly coactive regions were identified. One high-diversity region, the cortical amygdala (COA), was further interrogated using a chemogenetic approach. COA silencing in CIE mice reduced voluntary drinking, validating our network analysis and indicating that this region may play an important but underappreciated role in alcohol dependence.

                Precise targeting of deep brain structures in humans and large animal models has been a challenge for neuroscientists. Conventional protocols used in animal models typically require large access chambers which are prone to infection and involve assembly and implantation of complex microdrives for semi-chronic applications. Here we present a methodology for improving targeting of subcortical structures in large animals such as macaque monkeys, using image guided neuronavigation. Design of custom cranial caps allowed for incorporation of stable fiducial markers, required for increased targeting accuracy in neuronavigation procedures, resulting in an average targeting error of 1.6 mm over three implantations. Incorporation of anchor bolt chambers, commonly used in human neurosurgery, provided a minimally invasive entrance to the brain parenchyma, allowing for chronic recordings. By leveraging existing 3D printing technology, we fabricated an anchor bolt-mounted microdrive for semi-chronic applications. Our protocol leverages commercially available tools for implantation, decreases the risk of infection and complications of open craniotomies, and improves the accuracy and precision of chronic electrode implantations targeting deep brain structures in large animal models.

                Preclinical models of neurodevelopmental disorders typically use single inbred strains which fail to capture human genetic and symptom heterogeneity that is common clinically. We tested if systematically modeling human genetic diversity in mouse genetic reference panels would recapitulate population and individual differences in responses to a syndromic mutation in the high-confidence autism risk gene, CHD8. Trait disruptions mimicked those seen in human populations, including high penetrance of macrocephaly and disrupted behavior, but with robust strain and sex differences. For every trait, some strains exhibited a range of large effect size disruptions, sometimes in opposite directions, and remarkably others expressed resilience. Thus, systematically introducing genetic diversity into mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders provides a better framework for discovering individual differences in symptom etiologies and improved treatments.

                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acting upon its receptor Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (NTRK2, TRKB) plays a central role in the development and maintenance of synaptic function and activity- or drug-induced plasticity. TRKB possesses an inverted cholesterol-recognition and alignment consensus sequence (CARC), suggesting this receptor can act as a cholesterol sensor. We have recently shown that antidepressants drugs directly bind to the CARC domain of TRKB dimers, and that this binding as well as biochemical and behavioral responses to antidepressants are lost with a mutation in the TRKB CARC motif (Y433F). However, it is not clear if this mutation can also compromise the receptor function and lead to behavioral alterations. Here, we observed that Y433F mutation does not alter BDNF binding to TRKB, or BDNF-induced dimerization of TRKB. In this line, primary cultures from embryos of heterozygous Y433F mutant mice (hTRKB.Y433F) are responsive to BDNF-induced activation of TRKB, and samples from adult mice do not show any difference on TRKB activation compared to wild-type littermates (TRKB.wt). The behavioral phenotype of hTRKB.Y433F mice is indistinguishable from the wild-type mice in cued fear conditioning, contextual discrimination task or the elevated plus maze, whereas mice heterozygous to BDNF null allele show a phenotype in context discrimination task. Taken together, our results indicate that Y433F mutation in the TRKB CARC motif does not show signs of loss-of-function of BDNF responses, while antidepressant binding to TRKB and responses to antidepressants are lost in Y433F mutants, making them an interesting mouse model for antidepressant research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Input variability taps on invariant representations to enable generalization in visual perceptual learning</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus and location specificity are long considered hallmarks of visual perceptual learning. This renders visual perceptual learning distinct from other forms of learning, where generalization can be more easily attained, and unsuitable for practical applications, where generalization is key. Based on hypotheses derived from the structure of the visual system, we test here whether stimulus variability can unlock generalization in perceptual learning. We train subjects in orientation discrimination, while we vary the amount of variability in a task-irrelevant feature, spatial frequency. We find that independently of task difficulty, this manipulation enables generalization of learning to new stimuli and locations, while not negatively affecting the overall amount of learning on the task. We then use deep neural networks which recapitulate our findings in humans to investigate how variability unlocks generalization. We find that networks develop invariance to the task-irrelevant feature when trained with variable inputs. The degree of learned invariance strongly predicts generalization. A reliance on invariant representations can explain variability-induced generalization in visual perceptual learning, suggests new targets for understanding the neural basis of perceptual learning in high-order visual cortex, and presents an easy to implement modification of common training paradigms that may benefit practical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational Modeling of the Human Compound Action Potential</a></h4>

              
                The auditory nerve (AN) compound action potential (CAP) is an important tool for assessing auditory disorders and monitoring the health of the auditory periphery during surgical procedures. The CAP has been mathematically conceptualized as the convolution of a unit response (UR) waveform with the firing rate of a population of AN fibers. Here, an approach for predicting experimentally recorded CAPs in humans is proposed, which involves the use of human-based computational models to simulate AN activity. CAPs elicited by clicks, chirps, and amplitude-modulated carriers were simulated and compared with empirically recorded CAPs from human subjects. In addition, narrowband CAPs derived from noise-masked clicks and tone bursts were simulated. Many morphological, temporal, and spectral aspects of human CAPs were captured by the simulations for all stimuli tested. These findings support the use of model simulations of the human CAP to refine existing human-based models of the auditory periphery, aid in the design and analysis of auditory experiments, and predict the effects of hearing loss, synaptopathy, and other auditory disorders on the human CAP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Impact of Task Context on Predicting Finger Movements in a Brain-Machine Interface</a></h4>

              
                A key factor in the clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) for restoring hand motor function will be their robustness to changes in a task. With functional electrical stimulation (FES) for example, the patient's own hand will be used to produce a wide range of forces in otherwise similar movements. To investigate the impact of task changes on BMI performance, we trained two rhesus macaques to control a virtual hand with their physical hand while we added springs to each finger group (index or middle-ring-small) or altered their wrist posture. Using simultaneously recorded intracortical neural activity, finger positions, and electromyography, we found that predicting finger kinematics and finger-related muscle activations across contexts led to significant increases in prediction error, especially for muscle activations. However, with respect to online BMI control of the virtual hand, changing either training task context or the hand's physical context during online control had little effect on online performance. We explain this dichotomy by showing that the structure of neural population activity remained similar in new contexts, which could allow for fast adjustment online. Additionally, we found that neural activity shifted trajectories proportional to the required muscle activation in new contexts, possibly explaining biased kinematic predictions and suggesting a feature that could help predict different magnitude muscle activations while producing similar kinematics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using adversarial networks to extend brain computer interface decoding accuracy over time</a></h4>

              
                Existing intracortical brain computer interfaces (iBCIs) transform neural activity into control signals capable of restoring movement to persons with paralysis. However, the accuracy of the "decoder" at the heart of the iBCI typically degrades over time due to turnover of recorded neurons. To compensate, decoders can be recalibrated, but this requires the user to spend extra time and effort to provide the necessary data, then learn the new dynamics. As the recorded neurons change, one can think of the underlying movement intent signal being expressed in changing coordinates. If a mapping can be computed between the different coordinate systems, it may be possible to stabilize the original decoder's mapping from brain to behavior without recalibration. We previously proposed a method based on Generalized Adversarial Networks (GANs), called "Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network" (ADAN), which aligns the distributions of latent signals within underlying low-dimensional neural manifolds. However, ADAN was tested on only a very limited dataset. Here we propose a method based on Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GAN), which aligns the distributions of the full-dimensional neural recordings. We tested both Cycle-GAN and ADAN on data from multiple monkeys and behaviors and compared them to a linear method based on Procrustes Alignment of axes provided by Factor Analysis (PAF). Both GAN-based methods outperformed PAF. Cycle-GAN and ADAN (like PAF) are unsupervised and require little data, making them practical in real life. Overall, Cycle-GAN had the best performance and was easier to train and more robust than ADAN, making it ideal for stabilizing iBCI systems over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The differential effect of age on upper limb sensory processing, proprioception and motor function</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing consists in the integration and interpretation of somatosensory information. It builds upon proprioception but is a distinct function requiring complex processing by the brain over time. Currently little is known about the effect of aging on sensory processing ability, nor the influence of other covariates such as motor function, proprioception, or cognition. In this study, we measured upper limb passive and active sensory processing, motor function, proprioception, and cognition in 40 healthy younger adults and 54 older adults. We analyzed age differences across all measures and evaluated the influence of covariates on sensory processing through regression. Our results showed larger effect sizes for age differences in sensory processing (r=0.39-0.40) compared to motor function (r=0.18-0.22) and proprioception (r=0.10-0.27), but smaller than for cognition (r=0.56-0.63). Aside from age, we found no evidence that sensory processing performance was influenced by motor function or proprioception, but active sensory processing was influenced by cognition ({beta}=0.32-0.46). In conclusion, sensory processing showed an age-related decline, while some proprioceptive and motor abilities were preserved across age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Through the eye to the brain: Modulating LC-mediated arousal via pupil-based neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                The brains state of arousal influences cognitive functioning and mental well-being. It is controlled by several neuromodulatory nuclei in the brainstem and, particularly, by the locus coeruleus (LC). The LC is the main source of noradrenaline (NA) in the central nervous system where it exerts powerful effects on neural processing and autonomic function. Here, we investigate whether human participants can gain volitional control of their brains arousal state using a new neurofeedback approach which exploits the mechanism that the eyes pupil diameter provides an indirect readout of arousal if light conditions are controlled. We show that pupil-based neurofeedback training is essential for learning how to self-regulate pupil size. Once acquired, pupil self-regulation significantly modulates neuromodulatory brainstem centers involved in arousal control and particularly the LC-NA system when carefully measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Further, it modulates heart rate, a cardiovascular marker of autonomic function, and it has a significant effect on behavior and specific psychophysiological responses during an oddball task, an attention task that has been shown to be evoke stimulus-dependent LC-NA activity. Considering the modulatory effects of the LC-NA system and other arousal-regulating centers on cognitive functioning and various behaviors including stress-related responses, pupil-based neurofeedback has a tremendous potential to be translated to behavioral and clinical applications across various domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of stimulus timing on the acquisition of an olfactory working memory task in head-fixed mice</a></h4>

              
                Knowing what factors affect the acquisition of a behavioural task is central to understanding the mechanisms of learning and memory. It also has practical implications, as animal behavioural experiments used to probe cognitive functions often require long training durations. Delayed Match (or Non-Match)-to-Sample (DMS/DNMS) tasks are relatively complex tasks used to study working memory and sensory perception, but their use in the mouse remains hampered by the lengthy training involved. In this study, we assessed two aspects of stimulus timing on the acquisition of an olfactory DNMS task: how the sample-test odour delay durations and the reward timing affect the acquisition rate. We demonstrate that head-fixed mice learn to perform an olfactory DNMS task more quickly when the initial training uses a shorter sample-test odour delay without detectable loss of generalisability. Unexpectedly, we observed a slower task acquisition when the odour-reward interval was shorter. This effect was accompanied by a shortening of reaction times and more frequent sporadic licking. Analysis of this result using a drift-diffusion model indicated that a primary consequence of early reward delivery is a lower decision bound. Since an accurate performance with a lower decision bound requires greater discriminability in the sensory representations, this may underlie the slower learning rate with early reward arrival. Together, our results reflect the possible effects of stimulus timing on stimulus encoding and its consequence on the acquisition of a complex task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia antagonistically influence cortical activity and perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                The striatum, input nucleus of the basal ganglia, receives topographically organized input from the cortex and gives rise to the direct and indirect pathways with antagonistic effects on the output of the basal ganglia. We optogenetically stimulated the direct and indirect pathways in mice and measured their influence on perceptual decisions and neuronal activity in the cortex. In a task in which mice had to detect a visual stimulus, unilateral direct-pathway stimulation increased the probability of lick responses to the non-stimulated side and increased cortical activity globally. In contrast, indirect-pathway stimulation increased the probability of licks to the stimulated side and decreased activity in visual cortical areas. To probe the possible role of the two pathways in working memory, we trained the mice to report the location of a stimulus with licking one of two spouts, after a memory delay. Direct-pathway stimulation prior to and during the memory delay enhanced both the neural representation of a contralateral visual stimulus and the number of contraversive choices, whereas indirect-pathway stimulation had the opposite effects, in accordance with an antagonistic influence of the direct and indirect pathways on licking direction. Our results demonstrate how these two pathways influence perceptual decisions and working memories, and modify activity in the cerebral cortex.

                The loss of neurons in parafascicular thalamus (Pf) and of their inputs to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) are associated with Lewy body disease (LBD) and Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) and have been linked to the effects of neuroinflammation. In rats, these inputs regulate the function of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) that are necessary for the flexible encoding of the action-outcome (AO) associations for goal-directed action. We found that these inputs modify the encoding, not retrieval, of new AO associations and cause burst-pause firing of CINs in the DMS during AO remapping. These adaptive effects were abolished by neuroinflammation in the Pf, resulting in the loss of goal-directed control when the rats were required to update AO associations after a change in contingency. We found that the neuronal and behavioral deficits induced by inflammation in the Pf were rescued by administration of selegiline, a MAO-B inhibitor that we found also enhances ATPase activity in CINs, suggesting a potential treatment for cognitive deficits associated with inflammation affecting the function of midline thalamic nuclei and related structures.

                Cholinergic signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent cognitive and mood-related functions. However, the contribution of basal forebrain medial septum (MS) and diagonal band of Broca (DBB) cholinergic neurons that innervate the hippocampus and the identity of the cholinergic receptor(s) that regulate the production and maturation of new neurons are not completely understood. Using a targeted, selective ablation approach, we show that MS/DBB cholinergic neurons support both the survival and morphological maturation of adult-born neurons in the mouse hippocampus. We demonstrate that the muscarinic acetycholine receptor subtype M4 (M4 mAChR) is expressed on a population of quiescent neural precursor cells (NPCs) and that its pharmacological stimulation via intra-hippocampal or systemic administration of M4-selective modulators leads to their activation, thereby enhancing neurogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the activation of M4 mAChR-expressing quiescent NPCs ameliorates the MS/DBB cholinergic lesion-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis. In contrast, the impairment in the morphological maturation of adult-born neurons due to MS/DBB cholinergic neuron loss is further exacerbated by the systemic administration of an M4-selective allosteric potentiator. These findings reveal novel and stage-specific roles of cholinergic signaling in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis. They also uncouple the positive role of selective M4 potentiators in enhancing the production of new neurons from the M4-induced inhibition of their morphological maturation, at least in the context of cholinergic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fan cells in lateral entorhinal cortex directly influence medial entorhinal cortex through synaptic connections in layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Standard models for spatial and episodic memory suggest that the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) send parallel independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching the hippocampus. We demonstrate that fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of the MEC. Activation of fan cell inputs evokes monosynaptic glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow components mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively. Fan cell inputs also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2 of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for integration of what and where components of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting neuroinflammation with Abscisic Acid reducespain sensitivity in females and hyperactivity in males of an ADHD mice model</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by dopaminergic dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the link between dopaminergic deficit and neuroinflammation underlying ADHD symptoms. Subjects and Treatment: We used a validated ADHD mice model, that involves perinatal 6-OHDA lesion. Animals were treated with 20mg/L (drinking water) of Abscisic acid (ABA) for one month. We tested behaviour (learning and memory, anxiety, social interactions, and pain) in both females and male mice, in all eight groups (control and lesioned, with/without ABA). Postmortem, we analyzed microglia morphology and Ape1 expression in specific brain areas related to the descending pain inhibitory pathway. Results: In females, dopaminergic deficit increased pain sensitivity, but not hyperactivity, in contrast to males. This behaviour was associated with inflammatory microglia and lower Ape1 levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior insula cortex (IC). ABA treatment reduced inflammation and alleviated pain. In males, ABA reduced hyperactivity, but had no significant effect on inflammation. Conclusions: This is the first study proving a sex-dependent association between dopamine dysfunction and inflammation in specific brain areas, leading to different behavior outcomes in a mouse model of ADHD. These findings provide new clues for potential treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep neural network algorithms for noise reduction and their application to cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Despite excellent performance in quiet, cochlear implants (CIs) only partially restore normal levels of intelligibility in noisy settings. Recent developments in machine learning have resulted in deep neural network (DNN) models that achieve noteworthy performance in speech enhancement and separation tasks. However, there are no commercially available CI audio processors that utilize DNN models for noise reduction. We implemented two DNN models intended for applications in CIs: (1) a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a lightweight template model, and (2) SepFormer, which is the current top-performing speech separation model in the literature. The models were trained with a custom training dataset (30 hours) that included four configurations: speech in non-speech noise and speech in 1-talker, 2-talker, and 4-talker speech babble backgrounds. The enhancement of the target speech (or the suppression of the noise) by the models was evaluated by commonly used acoustic evaluation metrics of quality and intelligibility, including (1) signal-to-distortion ratio, (2) ``perceptual'' evaluation of speech quality, and (3) short-time objective intelligibility. Both DNN models yielded significant improvements in all acoustic metrics tested. The two DNN models were also evaluated with thirteen CI users using two types of background noise: (1) CCITT noise (speech-shaped stationary noise) and (2) 2-talker babble. Significant improvements in speech intelligibility were observed when the noisy speech was processed by the models, compared to the unprocessed conditions. This work serves as a proof of concept for the application of DNN technology in CIs for improved listening experience and speech comprehension in noisy environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning-dependent evolution of odor mixture representations in piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Rodents can learn from exposure to rewarding odors to make better and quicker decisions. The piriform cortex is thought to be important for learning complex odor associations, however it is not understood exactly how it learns to remember discriminations between many, sometimes overlapping, odor mixtures. We investigated how odor mixtures are represented in the posterior piriform cortex (pPC) of mice while they learn to discriminate a unique target odor mixture against hundreds of nontarget mixtures. We find that a significant proportion of pPC neurons discriminate between the target and all other nontarget odor mixtures. Neurons that prefer the target odor mixture tend to respond with brief increases in firing rate at odor onset compared to other neurons, which exhibit sustained and/or decreased firing. We allowed mice to continue training after they had reached high levels of performance and find that pPC neurons become more selective for target odor mixtures as well as for randomly chosen repeated nontarget odor mixtures that mice did not have to discriminate from other nontargets. These single unit changes during overtraining are accompanied by better categorization decoding at the population level, even though behavioral metrics of mice such as reward rate and latency to respond do not change. However, when difficult ambiguous trial types are introduced, the robustness of the target selectivity is correlated with better performance on the difficult trials. Taken together, these data reveal pPC as a dynamic and robust system that can optimize for both current and possible future task demands at once.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Classification of Human Chronotype Based on fMRINetwork-Based Statistics</a></h4>

              
                Chronotype - the relationship between the internal circadian physiology of an individual and the external 24-hour light-dark cycle - is increasingly implicated in mental health and cognition. Individuals presenting with a late chronotype have an increased likelihood of developing depression, and can display reduced cognitive performance during the societal 9-5 day. However, the interplay between physiological rhythms and the brain networks that underpin cognition and mental health are not well understood. To address this issue, we use resting state fMRI collected from 16 people with an early chronotype and 22 people with a late chronotype to study if differentiable information about chronotype is embedded in functional brain networks. We develop a classifier utilising the Network Based-Statistic (NBS) methodology, using rigorous selection criteria to select t-statistic thresholds within the NBS approach. We find significant differences in functional networks measured in early and late chronotypes and describe conditions under which the classifier achieves 97.3% accuracy. Revealing differences in functional brain networks based on extreme chronotype suggests future avenues of research that may ultimately better characterise the relationship between internal physiology, external perturbations, brain networks and disease.

                In contrast to mammals, the avian cochlea, specifically the basilar papilla, can regenerate sensory hair cells, which involves fate conversion of supporting cells to hair cells. To determine the mechanisms for converting supporting cells to hair cells, we used single-cell RNA sequencing during hair cell regeneration in explant cultures of chick basilar papillae. We identified dynamic changes in the gene expression of supporting cells, and the pseudotime trajectory analysis demonstrated the stepwise fate conversion from supporting cells to hair cells. Initially, supporting cell identity was erased and transition to the precursor state occurred. A subsequent gain in hair cell identity progressed together with downregulation of precursor-state genes. Transforming growth factor beta receptor 1-mediated signaling was involved in induction of the initial step, and its inhibition resulted in suppression of hair cell regeneration. Our data provide new insights for understanding fate conversion from supporting cells to hair cells in avian basilar papillae.

                The discovery that human brain connectivity data can be used as a 'fingerprint' to identify a given individual from a population, has become a burgeoning research area in the neuroscience field. Recent studies have identified the possibility to extract these brain signatures from the temporal rich dynamics of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. However, to what extent MEG signatures constitute a marker of human identifiability when engaged in task-related behavior remains an open question. Here, using MEG data from naturalistic and neurophysiological tasks, we show that identification improves in tasks relative to resting-state, providing compelling evidence for a task dependent axis of MEG signatures. Notably, improvements in identifiability were more prominent in strictly controlled tasks. Lastly, the brain regions contributing most towards individual identification were also modified when engaged in task activities. We hope that this investigation advances our understanding of the driving factors behind brain identification from MEG signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of motor vigour by expectation of reward probability trial-by-trial is preserved in healthy ageing and Parkinson's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                Motor improvements, such as faster movement times or increased velocity, have been consistently associated with reward magnitude in deterministic contexts. Yet whether individual inferences on reward probability influence motor vigour dynamically remains undetermined. Here we investigated how dynamically inferring volatile action-reward contingencies modulated motor performance trial-by-trial in healthy younger (HYA, 37) and older adults (HOA, 37), and in medicated Parkinson's Disease patients (PD, 20). We conducted an online study that coupled a standard one-armed bandit decision-making paradigm with a motor sequence task and used a validated hierarchical Bayesian model to fit trial-by-trial data. Our results showed that stronger predictions about the tendency of the action-reward contingency led to faster performance tempo on a trial-by-trial basis without modulating reaction times (RT). Using Bayesian linear mixed models, we demonstrated in HYA, HOA and PD a similar sensitivity (slope) of execution tempo to inferences about the reward probabilities, despite HOA and PD being generally slower than HYA (intercept). In a second experiment in HYA (39), we additionally showed that subjective inferences about credit assignment - whether lack of reward is associated with an incorrect decision or execution error - led to a similar modulation of motor vigour by reward expectation. Our study is the first to reveal that the dynamic updating of beliefs about volatile action-reward contingencies positively biases motor performance through faster execution tempo, without affecting RT. We also provide novel evidence for a preserved sensitivity of motor vigour to inferences about the action-reward mapping in ageing and medicated PD.

                Heterogeneity is the norm in biology. The brain is no different: neuronal cell-types are myriad, reflected through their cellular morphology, type, excitability, connectivity motifs and ion channel distributions. While this biophysical diversity enriches neural systems' dynamical repertoire, it remains challenging to reconcile with the robustness and persistence of brain function over time. To better understand the relationship between heterogeneity and resilience, we analyzed both analytically and numerically a non-linear sparse neural network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections evolving over long time scales. We examined how neural diversity expressed as excitability heterogeneity in this network influences its dynamic volatility (i.e., its susceptibility to critical transitions). We exposed this network to slowly-varying modulatory fluctuations, continuously interrogating its stability and resilience. Our results show that excitability heterogeneity implements a homeostatic control mechanism tuning network stability in a context-dependent way. Such diversity was also found to enhance network resilience, quenching the volatility of its dynamics, effectively making the system independent of changes in many control parameters, such as population size, connection probability, strength and variability of synaptic weights as well as modulatory drive. Taken together, these results highlight the fundamental role played by cell-type heterogeneity in the robustness of brain function in the face of change.

                Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks through metabolic support, facilitation of synaptic function, and optimization of electrophysiological activity. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Here we present a novel method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitors to functional astrocytes in 28 days using a culture medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). This approach yields highly pure populations of astrocytes expressing canonical astrocyte markers, which we confirmed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. Human PSC-derived astrocytes efficiently buffer glutamate and robustly support neural network activity. Co-cultures of hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons on multi-electrode arrays generated robust network activity within 2 days and synchronous network bursts after 6 days. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increased frequency of postsynaptic currents in human hPSC-derived neurons co-cultured with hPSC-derived versus primary rodent astrocytes, consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density. Furthermore, hPSC-derived astrocytes retained their hominid morphology when transplanted into a mouse brain. In conclusion, we present a novel protocol to obtain functional astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells, providing a platform for investigating human astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Relating local connectivity and global dynamics in recurrent excitatory-inhibitory networks</a></h4>

              
                How the connectivity of cortical networks determines the neural dynamics and the resulting computations is one of the key questions in neuroscience. Previous works have pursued two complementary strategies to quantify the structure in connectivity, by specifying either the local statistics of connectivity motifs between small groups of neurons, or by defining network-wide low-rank patterns of connectivity that determine the resulting low-dimensional dynamics. A direct relationship between these two approaches is however currently missing, and in particular it remains to be clarified how local connectivity statistics are related to the global connectivity structure and shape the low-dimensional activity. To bridge this gap, here we develop a method for mapping local connectivity statistics onto an approximate global low-rank structure. Our method rests on approximating the global connectivity matrix using dominant eigenvectors, which we compute using perturbation theory for random matrices. This approach demonstrates that multi-population networks defined from local connectivity properties can in general be approximated by low-rank connectivity with Gaussian-mixture statistics. We specifically apply this method to excitatory-inhibitory networks, and show that it leads to accurate predictions for both the low-dimensional dynamics, and for the activity of individual neurons. Altogether, our approach allows us to disentangle the effects of mean connectivity and reciprocal motifs on the global recurrent feedback, and provides an intuitive picture of how local connectivity shapes global network dynamics.

                Ischemic stroke results in sudden blood flow cessation, thus, unmet energy requirements. Although the clotted artery can be recanalized and blood flow is restored, brain perfusion may not be fully attained due to microvascular constrictions. Under glucose-deprived and hypoxic conditions, glucose derived from the glycogen stored around peri-microvascular astrocyte end-feet may serve as an emergency fuel to meet the metabolic demand during the acute period of ischemic stroke. To elucidate the impact of glycogen utilization on brain microcirculation, we administered glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB) intracerebroventricularly. Transgenic mice in which glycogen synthase-1 expression was selectively knocked out in central nervous system (GYS1Nestin-KO) were also used. Both approaches caused microvascular constrictions mediated by CD13-positive pericyte contractions. When mice with disrupted glycogen utilization were subjected to MCA ischemia, pericyte-mediated microvascular constrictions and the infarct volumes were further increased compared to untreated controls or wild-type littermates. Peri-microvascular glycogen depletions were highly correlated with microvascular constrictions as shown by Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining and immunolabeling with anti-glycogen antibodies. Imaging of regional cortical blood flow changes during ischemia disclosed severely compromised blood flow dynamics in mice with disrupted glycogen metabolism. In conclusion, disrupting glycogen utilization causes ischemic-like microvascular constrictions under non-ischemic circumstances and increases susceptibility to brain ischemia. Understanding the role of glycogen at neurogliovascular level in brain may provide novel insight to the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and therapeutic opportunities.

	<p>Mind wandering (MW) is a common feature of the human experience occurring when our attention shifts from the task at hand to inner thoughts. MW seems to be often future-oriented and could be used to help people to carry out their planned actions (Prospective Memory PM). Here, we tested the link between MW and the ability to perform PM intentions. We assessed MW and PM over 15 days using experience-sampling probes via mobile phone (226 participants) associated with a naturalistic PM task. We confirmed that MW occupies a significant proportion of our mental activity (40%). This time seems to be mainly used to project ourselves into the future (64%), whether to anticipate and imagine the long term (20%) or to plan daily obligations (44%). Intriguingly, only past-oriented thoughts (9%) predict the PM performance. We discuss the possible functional role played by MW in maintaining intentions in mind.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioma is one of the major health problems worldwide. Biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of Glioma are still needed. Methods: The transcriptome data and clinic information on Glioma were obtained from the CGGA, TCGA, GDC, and GEO databases. The immune infiltration status in the clusters was compared. The genes with differential expression were identified, and a prognostic model was developed. Several assays were used to detect RPH3A&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in Glioma cells, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell migration assay. Results: Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) was divided into two clusters. The immune infiltration difference was observed between the two clusters. We screened for genes that differed between the two groups. WGCNA was used to construct a co-expressed network using the DEGs, and four co-expressed modules were identified, which are blue, green, grey, and yellow modules. High-risk patients have a lower overall survival rate than low-risk patients. In addition, the risk score is associated with histological subtypes. Finally, the role of RPH3A was detected. The overexpression of RPH3A in LGG cells can significantly inhibit cell proliferation and migration and regulate EMT-regulated proteins. Conclusion: Our study developed a metabolic-related model for the prognosis of Glioma cells. RPH3A is a potential therapeutic target for Glioma.</p>

	<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) causes the release of several neuromodulators, leading to cortical activation and deactivation. The resulting preparatory cortical plasticity can be used to increase learning and memory in both rats and humans. The effects of VNS on cognition have mostly been studied either in animal models of different pathologies, and/or after extended VNS. Considerably less is known about the effects of acute VNS. Here, we examined the effects of acute VNS on short-term memory and cognitive flexibility in na&amp;amp;iuml;ve rats, using three cognitive tasks that require comparatively brief (single session) training periods. In all tasks, VNS was delivered immediately before or during the testing phase. We used a rule-shifting task to test cognitive flexibility, a novel object recognition task to measure short-term object memory, and a delayed spontaneous alternation task to measure spatial short-term memory. We also analyzed exploratory behavior in an elevated plus maze to determine the effects of acute VNS on anxiety. Our results indicate that acute VNS can improve memory and cognitive flexibility relative to Sham-stimulation, and these effects are independent of unspecific VNS-induced changes in locomotion or anxiety.</p>

	<p>Deficits in social cognition and function are characteristic of dementia, commonly accompanied by a loss of awareness of the presence or extent of these deficits. This lack of awareness can impair social relationships, increase patients&amp;amp;rsquo; and carers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden, and contribute to increased rates of institutionalization. Despite clinical importance, neural correlates of this complex phenomenon remain unclear. We conducted a systematic search of five electronic databases to identify functional and structural neuroimaging studies investigating the neural correlates of impaired awareness of social cognition and function in any dementia type. We rated study quality and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results of the eight studies that met the predefined eligibility criteria. Across these studies, deficits in awareness of impairments in social cognition and function were associated with structural or functional abnormalities in the frontal pole, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and insula. Several identified regions overlap with established neural correlates of social cognition. More research is needed to understand awareness of social cognition and function and how this becomes impaired in dementia to improve neuroscientific understanding, aid the identification of this problematic symptom, and target interventions to reduce burden and improve care.</p>

	<p>Cognitive effort is intrinsically linked to task difficulty, intelligence, and mental toughness. Intelligence reflects an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive aptitude, whereas mental toughness (MT) reflects an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s resilience in pursuing success. Research shows that parietal alpha oscillations are associated with changes in task difficulty. Critically, it remains unclear whether parietal alpha oscillations are modulated by intelligence and MT as a personality trait. We examined event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) of alpha oscillations associated with encoding, retention, and recognition in the Sternberg task in relation to intelligence and mental toughness. Eighty participants completed the Sternberg task with 3, 4, 5 and 6 digits, Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test and an MT questionnaire. A positive dependence on difficulty was observed for all studied oscillatory effects (t = &amp;amp;minus;8.497, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; t = 2.806, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005; t = &amp;amp;minus;2.103, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The influence of Raven intelligence was observed for encoding-related alpha ERD (t = &amp;amp;minus;2.02, p = 0.049). The influence of MT was observed only for difficult conditions in recognition-related alpha ERD (t = &amp;amp;minus;3.282, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). Findings indicate that the modulation of alpha rhythm related to encoding, retention and recognition may be interpreted as correlates of cognitive effort modulation. Specifically, results suggest that effort related to encoding depends on intelligence, whereas recognition-related effort level depends on mental toughness.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Increased levels of inflammatory proteins have been observed in brain and plasma samples of AD patients; however, it is not clear if other serum proteins correlate to the development or disease progression of AD. (2) Methods: Micro-Western Array (MWA) is a high-throughput antibody-based proteomics system which allows detection of the expression levels of 24&amp;amp;ndash;96 different proteins within 6&amp;amp;ndash;30 samples simultaneously. We applied MWA to explore potential serum protein biomarkers correlated to the development and progression of AD by examining the difference in serum protein profile of 31 healthy control (HC), 30 patients with AD and 30 patients&amp;amp;rsquo; adult children (ACS). (3) Results: Compared to HC, AD and ACS express similar pattern of serum proteins, including higher protein levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, SREBP1 and LXR&amp;amp;beta; but lower protein levels of ApoD, ApoE, ApoH, c_Myc, COX2 and Hippo-YAP signaling proteins. AD patients had higher serum levels of ABCG1, ApoD, ApoH, COX2, LXR&amp;amp;alpha; and YAP, but lower levels of ABCA1, ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST1, MST2, Nanog, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B_p50, PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; and SREBP2, as compared to ACS. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis revealed that the protein expression level of ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST2, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B p50, PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; and SREBP1 was negatively correlated to age, while that of ApoE, c_Myc, LATS1, MST1, MST2, Nanog, NF&amp;amp;kappa;B p50 and PPAR&amp;amp;gamma; was positively correlated to age. (4) Conclusions: We identified a group of serum proteins which may correlate to disease progression of AD and can be potential diagnostic serum protein biomarkers.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Breastfeeding confers robust benefits to offspring development in terms of growth, immunity, and neurophysiology. Similarly, improving environmental complexity, i.e., environmental enrichment (EE), contributes developmental advantages to both humans and laboratory animal models. However, the impact of environmental context on maternal care and milk quality has not been thoroughly evaluated, nor are the biological underpinnings of EE on offspring development understood. Here, Sprague Dawley rats were housed and bred in either EE or standard-housed (SD) conditions. EE dams gave birth to a larger number of pups, and litters were standardized and cross-fostered across groups on postnatal day (P)1. Maternal milk samples were then collected on P1 (transitional milk phase) and P10 (mature milk phase) for analysis. While EE dams spent less time nursing, postnatal enrichment exposure was associated with heavier offspring bodyweights. Milk from EE mothers had increased triglyceride levels, a greater microbiome diversity, and a significantly higher abundance of bacterial families related to bodyweight and energy metabolism. These differences reflected comparable transcriptomic changes at the genome-wide level. In addition to changes in lactational quality, we observed elevated levels of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the hypothalamus of EE dams, and sex-dependent and time-dependent effects of EE on offspring social behavior. Together, these results underscore the multidimensional impact of the combined neonatal and maternal environments on offspring development and maternal health. Moreover, they highlight potential deficiencies in the use of "gold standard" laboratory housing in the attempt to design translationally relevant animal models in biomedical research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Advancing South-South cooperation in education: Indonesian experience with South Africa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Education collaboration is important to increase the quality of human capital. South-South cooperation is conducted to exchange resources, technology, skills, and knowledge between southern countries. The purpose of this research is to investigate the collaboration between Indonesia and South Africa toward advancing South-South Cooperation in education. The data collection used in this qualitative research is an interview and literature study with 9 purposive informants from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Indonesia Ministry of Education and Culture, and the Embassy of South Africa. The data were obtained within six months. The interview was primarily used to explore the roles and practices of government institutions and universities in fostering education collaboration and human resources development. In this study, the South-South Cooperation helps Indonesia address its educational needs. The result showed that most international education cooperation between both countries is agreed upon at the University-to-University level through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), facing less sustainable challenges and low impact. Therefore, an investment-led model, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a tool to monitor and evaluate this process are needed to improve South-South Cooperation to achieve its goals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neuro-immunological complications post COVID-19 vaccination: two case reports [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To add to the growing literature regarding the possible link between the onset of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines. Case reports: The first patient is a 38-year-old man that presented muscle weakness and an unsteady gait for a duration of one week. Initially, he developed an unsteady gait, then gradually worsening generalized muscle fatigue and ascending weakness in all limbs. He tested positive for GM1 and GQ1D antibodies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with contrast and nerve conduction study (NCS) results were both suggestive of acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). The second patient is a 54-year-old man that developed generalized fatigue and subjective fever associated with headache and blurry vision followed by bulbar dysfunction. During hospitalization, his consciousness level started to be affected and he developed ataxia with ophthalmoparesis. A diagnosis of BBE was made based on clinical, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Conclusion: Since temporal relationships do not signify causation, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the association between COVID-19 vaccines and these neurological disorders. However, it is vital that new cases are reported so that the knowledge base is built upon, and to increase healthcare workers’ vigilance for early signs of GBS or BBE.

                Background: The standardization and mechanism of action of Caesalpinia sappan as an anticancer agent are still lacking. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of action of  C,sappan extract as an anticancer agent. Methods: This study was conducted using the A549 lung cancer cell line to understand the mechanism of action of C. sappan extract as an anticancer agent. The cytotoxicity activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, protein-related apoptosis (i.e., BCL-2and BAX protein) assays, and RNA sequencing were performed level were measured. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, and phenolics of C.sappan were also assessed. Results: C.sappan has strong antioxidant activity (22.14 ± 0.93 ppm) total flavonoid content of (529.3 ± 4.56 mgQE/g), and phenolics content of (923.37 ± 5 mgGAE/g). The C.sappan ethanol extract inhibited cancer cell growth and arrested at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis by increasing BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio in A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing analysis showed that C.sappan ethanol extract caused downregulation of genes acting on mitochondrial function including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.sappan has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Practical identifiability analysis of a mechanistic model for the time to distant metastatic relapse and its application to renal cell carcinoma</a></h4>

Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) curves are widely used in oncology. They are classically analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator or agnostic statistical models from survival analysis. Here we report on a method to extract more information from DMFS curves using a mathematical model of primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. The model depends on two parameters, <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, respectively quantifying tumor growth and dissemination. We assumed these to be lognormally distributed in a patient population. We propose a method for identification of the parameters of these distributions based on least-squares minimization between the data and the simulated survival curve. We studied the practical identifiability of these parameters and found that including the percentage of patients with metastasis at diagnosis was critical to ensure robust estimation. We also studied the impact and identifiability of covariates and their coefficients in <i>α</i> and <i>μ</i>, either categorical or continuous, including various functional forms for the latter (threshold, linear or a combination of both). We found that both the functional form and the coefficients could be determined from DMFS curves. We then applied our model to a clinical dataset of metastatic relapse from kidney cancer with individual data of 105 patients. We show that the model was able to describe the data and illustrate our method to disentangle the impact of three covariates on DMFS: a categorical one (Führman grade) and two continuous ones (gene expressions of the macrophage mannose receptor 1 (MMR) and the G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member A (GPRC5a)gene). We found that all had an influence in metastasis dissemination (<i>μ</i>), but not on growth (<i>α</i>).

Special sessions are important parts of scientific meetings and conferences: They gather together researchers and students interested in a specific topic and can strongly contribute to the success of the conference itself. Moreover, they can be the first step for trainees and students to the organization of a scientific event. Organizing a special session, however, can be uneasy for beginners and students. Here, we provide ten simple rules to follow to organize a special session at a scientific conference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Constructive connectomics: How neuronal axons get from here to there using gene-expression maps derived from their family trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stan Kerstjens, Gabriela Michel, Rodney J. Douglas</p>

During brain development, billions of axons must navigate over multiple spatial scales to reach specific neuronal targets, and so build the processing circuits that generate the intelligent behavior of animals. However, the limited information capacity of the zygotic genome puts a strong constraint on how, and which, axonal routes can be encoded. We propose and validate a mechanism of development that can provide an efficient encoding of this global wiring task. The key principle, confirmed through simulation, is that basic constraints on mitoses of neural stem cells—that mitotic daughters have similar gene expression to their parent and do not stray far from one another—induce a global hierarchical map of nested regions, each marked by the expression profile of its common progenitor population. Thus, a traversal of the lineal hierarchy generates a systematic sequence of expression profiles that traces a staged route, which growth cones can follow to their remote targets. We have analyzed gene expression data of developing and adult mouse brains published by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and found them consistent with our simulations: gene expression indeed partitions the brain into a global spatial hierarchy of nested contiguous regions that is stable at least from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56. We use this experimental data to demonstrate that our axonal guidance algorithm is able to robustly extend arbors over long distances to specific targets, and that these connections result in a qualitatively plausible connectome. We conclude that, paradoxically, cell division may be the key to uniting the neurons of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Archetypal Analysis for population genetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Gimbernat-Mayol, Albert Dominguez Mantes, Carlos D. Bustamante, Daniel Mas Montserrat, Alexander G. Ioannidis</p>

The estimation of genetic clusters using genomic data has application from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to demographic history to polygenic risk scores (PRS) and is expected to play an important role in the analyses of increasingly diverse, large-scale cohorts. However, existing methods are computationally-intensive, prohibitively so in the case of nationwide biobanks. Here we explore Archetypal Analysis as an efficient, unsupervised approach for identifying genetic clusters and for associating individuals with them. Such unsupervised approaches help avoid conflating socially constructed ethnic labels with genetic clusters by eliminating the need for exogenous training labels. We show that Archetypal Analysis yields similar cluster structure to existing unsupervised methods such as ADMIXTURE and provides interpretative advantages. More importantly, we show that since Archetypal Analysis can be used with lower-dimensional representations of genetic data, significant reductions in computational time and memory requirements are possible. When Archetypal Analysis is run in such a fashion, it takes several orders of magnitude less compute time than the current standard, ADMIXTURE. Finally, we demonstrate uses ranging across datasets from humans to canids.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, but increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation also plays a key role, driven by the activation of microglia. Aβ and tau pathology appear to spread along pathways of highly connected brain regions, but it remains elusive whether microglial activation follows a similar distribution pattern. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with microglia activation patterns.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 32 Aβ-positive early AD subjects (18 women, 14 men) and 18 Aβ-negative age-matched healthy controls (10 women, 8 men) from the prospective ActiGliA (Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease) study. All participants underwent microglial activation positron emission tomography (PET) with the third-generation mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]GE-180 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure resting-state functional and structural connectivity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that inter-regional covariance in TSPO-PET and standardized uptake value ratio was preferentially distributed along functionally highly connected brain regions, with MRI structural connectivity showing a weaker association with microglial activation. AD patients showed increased TSPO-PET tracer uptake bilaterally in the anterior medial temporal lobe compared to controls, and higher TSPO-PET uptake was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia severity in a disease stage-dependent manner.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Microglial activation distributes preferentially along highly connected brain regions, similar to tau pathology. These findings support the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, and we speculate that pathology spreads throughout the brain along vulnerable connectivity pathways.

                Background: This mixed-methods study was undertaken to ascertain undergraduate medical students’ perceptions of remote learning following the COVID-19 restrictions. 545 students participated in this study. Methods: Data was collected using a validated questionnaire and four focus group discussions. Results: Regarding recorded lectures, the quantitative findings indicated that they were important during online learning and the qualitative findings explained that the recorded lectures enabled individual students to pace and customize their learning. The majority of the students agreed that recorded lectures were relevant to their learning, though they watched less than 50% of recorded lectures. Qualitative findings described procrastination as the rationale for not watching the videos. The online live lectures had a relatively higher percentage of contribution towards learning in comparison with instructor recorded video lectures. Students were more engaged with live lectures, and 63.3% of respondents agreed. Qualitative findings confirmed the opportunities for interacting with peers and better clarification of doubts by teachers during live lectures. Conclusions: Online learning with recorded and live lectures provided continuity in medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared to recorded video lectures, synchronous live lectures were regarded as superior by students largely due to the opportunity to directly communicate with the instructor and receive quick feedback.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The future of food and nutrition in ELIXIR [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Non-communicable diseases are on the rise and are often related to food choices; nutrition affects infectious diseases too. Therefore, there is growing interest in research on public and personal health, as related to food, nutrition behaviour and well-being of consumers throughout the life cycle. These concepts and their relations are complex and only partially understood – more data is needed to improve our understanding. The required data include deep geno- and phenotyping data from human nutritional studies, covering metabolic and health, but also including behavioural and socio-economic data. The aim of this white paper is to provide a guiding framework for the future contributions of ELIXIR’s recently established Food & Nutrition (F&N) Community. This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting that took place in September 2019 in The Hague (NL) and involved representatives of 14 countries representing the ELIXIR Nodes. The meeting led to the definition of F&N related bioinformatics challenges, including the use of standards for data reuse and sharing, and for interoperability of data, tools and services, advocacy and training. Resolving these bioinformatics challenges makes it possible to address a wide range of F&N-related challenges, such as definition of an individual health status, individual dietary needs, and finding complex intake biomarkers (to replace questionnaires). Here, we provide suggestions on how to align these tasks within the ELIXIR Platforms, other ELIXIR Communities/Focus Groups and the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures.
