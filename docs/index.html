              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20408">Brain-Inspired Exploration of Functional Networks and Key Neurons in Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked significant interest among researchers to understand their mechanisms and functional characteristics. Although existing studies have attempted to explain LLM functionalities by identifying and interpreting specific neurons, these efforts mostly focus on individual neuron contributions, neglecting the fact that human brain functions are realized through intricate interaction networks. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on functional brain networks (FBNs), this study introduces a novel approach to investigate whether similar functional networks exist within LLMs. We use methods similar to those in the field of functional neuroimaging analysis to locate and identify functional networks in LLM. Experimental results show that, similar to the human brain, LLMs contain functional networks that frequently recur during operation. Further analysis shows that these functional networks are crucial for LLM performance. Masking key functional networks significantly impairs the model's performance, while retaining just a subset of these networks is adequate to maintain effective operation. This research provides novel insights into the interpretation of LLMs and the lightweighting of LLMs for certain downstream tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20753">Deviance Detection and Regularity Sensitivity in Dissociated Neuronal Cultures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neural networks process complex patterns of information is crucial for advancing both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To investigate fundamental principles of neural computation, we studied dissociated neuronal cultures, one of the most primitive living neural networks, on high-resolution CMOS microelectrode arrays and tested whether the dissociated culture exhibits regularity sensitivity beyond mere stimulus-specific adaptation and deviance detection. In oddball electrical stimulation paradigms, we confirmed that the neuronal culture produced mismatch responses (MMRs) with true deviance detection beyond mere adaptation. These MMRs were dependent on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, similar to mismatch negativity (MMN) in humans, which is known to have true deviance detection properties. Crucially, we also showed sensitivity to the statistical regularity of stimuli, a phenomenon previously observed only in intact brains: the MMRs in a predictable, periodic sequence were smaller than those in a commonly used sequence in which the appearance of the deviant stimulus was random and unpredictable. These results challenge the traditional view that a hierarchically structured neural network is required to process complex temporal patterns, suggesting instead that deviant detection and regularity sensitivity are inherent properties arising from the primitive neural network. They also suggest new directions for the development of neuro-inspired artificial intelligence systems, emphasizing the importance of incorporating adaptive mechanisms and temporal dynamics in the design of neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20862">Analysis of Evolving Cortical Neuronal Networks Using Visual Informatics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the changes exhibited by evolving neuronal dynamics from high-dimensional activity data is essential for advancing neuroscience, particularly in the study of neuronal network development and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This work examines how advanced dimensionality reduction techniques can efficiently summarize and enhance our understanding of the development of neuronal networks over time and in response to stimulation. We develop a framework based on the Minimum-Distortion Embedding (MDE) methods and demonstrate how MDE outperforms better known benchmarks based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) by effectively preserving both global structures and local relationships within complex neuronal datasets. Our \emph{in silico} experiments reveal MDE's capability to capture the evolving connectivity patterns of simulated neuronal networks, illustrating a clear trajectory tracking the simulated network development. Complementary \emph{in vitro} experiments further validate MDE's advantages, highlighting its ability to identify behavioral differences and connectivity changes in neuronal cultures over a 35-day observation period. Additionally, we explore the effects of stimulation on neuronal activity, providing valuable insights into the plasticity and learning mechanisms of neuronal networks. Our findings underscore the importance of metric selection in dimensionality reduction, showing that correlation metrics yield more meaningful embeddings compared to Euclidean distance. The implications of this research extend to various areas, including the potential development of therapeutic intervention strategies for neurological disorders, and the identification of distinct phases of neuronal activity for advancing cortical-based computing devices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21129">Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) with Diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) as a novel method to retrieve the indices of the microscopic propagator which is the probability density function of water displacements due to diffusion within the nervous tissue microstructures. Unlike the Ensemble Average Propagator indices or the Diffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent from the mesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal bundle directions and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are more specific to the volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons and cells, that are present in the tissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be more directly linked to alterations in the presence and integrity of microstructures themselves. The methodology behind MPI is rooted on zonal modeling of spherical harmonics, signal simulation, and machine learning regression, and is demonstrated on both synthetic and Human Diffusion MRI data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21217">Dynamic Markov Blanket Detection for Macroscopic Physics Discovery</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free energy principle (FEP), along with the associated constructs of Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the core components of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is, a mathematical theory of ``every'' ``thing''. Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20404">Noise induced extreme events in single Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model serves as a fundamental neuronal model which is extensively studied across various dynamical scenarios, we explore the dynamics of a scalar FHN oscillator under the influence of white noise. Unlike previous studies, in which extreme events (EE) were observed solely in coupled FHN oscillators, we demonstrate that a single system can exhibit EE induced by noise. Perturbation of the deterministic model in its steady state by random fluctuations reveals the emergence of subthreshold/small-amplitude oscillations (SAO), eventually leading to rare and extreme large-amplitude oscillations (LAO), which become particularly evident at minimal noise intensities. We elucidate the route by which these EE emerge, confirming their occurrence through probability calculations of trajectories in phase space. Additionally, our investigation reveals bursting phenomena in the system, which are characterized by specific levels of noise amplitude and elucidated using inter-spike interval statistics. At higher noise amplitudes, frequent LAO production is observed and attributed to self-induced stochastic resonance. The emergence of EE is explained through the theory of large fluctuations, with the escape rates of trajectories estimated via both analytical and numerical approaches. This study is significant because it reveals EE and bursting phenomena in a single FHN oscillator, offering potential new insights into the dynamics of neuronal populations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580">Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20779">Triple Phase Transitions: Understanding the Learning Dynamics of Large Language Models from a Neuroscience Perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.20779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit abrupt emergent behavior, whereby new abilities arise at certain points during their training. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a ''phase transition'', remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct an integrative analysis of such phase transitions by examining three interconnected perspectives: the similarity between LLMs and the human brain, the internal states of LLMs, and downstream task performance. We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation. These findings illuminate the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in LLMs, while opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research bridging AI and neuroscience.

                arXiv:2502.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21142">Multimodal Dreaming: A Global Workspace Approach to World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.

Abstract: We present a system for decoding hand movements using surface EMG signals. The interface provides real-time (25 Hz) reconstruction of finger joint angles across 20 degrees of freedom, designed for upper limb amputees. Our offline analysis shows 0.8 correlation between predicted and actual hand movements. The system functions as an integrated pipeline with three key components: (1) a VR-based data collection platform, (2) a transformer-based model for EMG-to-motion transformation, and (3) a real-time calibration and feedback module called ALVI Interface. Using eight sEMG sensors and a VR training environment, users can control their virtual hand down to finger joint movement precision, as demonstrated in our video: youtube link.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.

                arXiv:2406.07843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be state-of-the-art models for visual cortical neurons. Cortical neurons in the primary visual cortex are sensitive to contextual information mediated by extensive horizontal and feedback connections. Standard CNNs integrate global contextual information to model contextual modulation via two mechanisms: successive convolutions and a fully connected readout layer. In this paper, we find that self-attention (SA), an implementation of non-local network mechanisms, can improve neural response predictions over parameter-matched CNNs in two key metrics: tuning curve correlation and peak tuning. We introduce peak tuning as a metric to evaluate a model's ability to capture a neuron's top feature preference. We factorize networks to assess each context mechanism, revealing that information in the local receptive field is most important for modeling overall tuning, but surround information is critically necessary for characterizing the tuning peak. We find that self-attention can replace posterior spatial-integration convolutions when learned incrementally, and is further enhanced in the presence of a fully connected readout layer, suggesting that the two context mechanisms are complementary. Finally, we find that decomposing receptive field learning and contextual modulation learning in an incremental manner may be an effective and robust mechanism for learning surround-center interactions.

                arXiv:2502.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired computational paradigm that emulates neuronal activity through discrete spike-based processing. Despite their advantages, training SNNs with traditional backpropagation (BP) remains challenging due to computational inefficiencies and a lack of biological plausibility. This study explores the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as an alternative learning framework for SNNs. Unlike backpropagation, which relies on forward and backward passes, the FF algorithm employs two forward passes, enabling localized learning, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. We introduce an FF-based SNN training framework and evaluate its performance across both non-spiking (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10) and spiking (Neuro-MNIST, SHD) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing FF-based SNNs by over 5% on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art backpropagation-trained SNNs. On more complex tasks such as CIFAR-10 and SHD, our approach outperforms other SNN models by up to 6% and remains competitive with leading backpropagation-trained SNNs. These findings highlight the FF algorithm's potential to advance SNN training methodologies and neuromorphic computing by addressing key limitations of backpropagation.

                arXiv:2502.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of neuromorphic computing, integrating biologically-inspired models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Astrocyte (LIFA) into spiking neural networks (SNNs) enhances system robustness and performance. This paper introduces the LIFA model in SNNs, addressing energy efficiency, memory management, routing mechanisms, and fault tolerance. Our core architecture consists of neurons, synapses, and astrocyte circuits, with each astrocyte supporting multiple neurons for self-repair. This clustered model improves fault tolerance and operational efficiency, especially under adverse conditions. We developed a routing methodology to map the LIFA model onto a fault-tolerant, many-core design, optimizing network functionality and efficiency. Our model features a fault tolerance rate of 81.10\% and a resilience improvement rate of 18.90\%, significantly surpassing other implementations. The results validate our approach in memory management, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for advanced neuromorphic computing applications. The integration of astrocytes represents a significant advancement, setting the stage for more resilient and adaptable neuromorphic systems.

                arXiv:2502.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering aims to advance computing by mimicking the brain's efficient processing, where data is encoded as asynchronous temporal events. This eliminates the need for a synchronisation clock and minimises power consumption when no data is present. However, many benchmarks for neuromorphic algorithms primarily focus on spatial features, neglecting the temporal dynamics that are inherent to most sequence-based tasks. This gap may lead to evaluations that fail to fully capture the unique strengths and characteristics of neuromorphic systems. In this paper, we present NeuroMorse, a temporally structured dataset designed for benchmarking neuromorphic learning systems. NeuroMorse converts the top 50 words in the English language into temporal Morse code spike sequences. Despite using only two input spike channels for Morse dots and dashes, complex information is encoded through temporal patterns in the data. The proposed benchmark contains feature hierarchy at multiple temporal scales that test the capacity of neuromorphic algorithms to decompose input patterns into spatial and temporal hierarchies. We demonstrate that our training set is challenging to categorise using a linear classifier and that identifying keywords in the test set is difficult using conventional methods. The NeuroMorse dataset is available at Zenodo, with our accompanying code on GitHub at https://github.com/Ben-E-Walters/NeuroMorse.

                arXiv:2502.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we manually design an evolutionary optimization algorithm, we implicitly or explicitly assume a set of target optimization problems. In the case of automated algorithm design, target optimization problems are usually explicitly shown. Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) for the design of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been examined in some studies. In those studies, target multi-objective problems are not always explicitly shown. It is well known in the EMO community that the performance evaluation results of EMO algorithms depend on not only test problems but also many other factors such as performance indicators, reference point, termination condition, and population size. Thus, it is likely that the designed EMO algorithms by LLMs depends on those factors. In this paper, we try to examine the implicit assumption about the performance comparison of EMO algorithms in LLMs. For this purpose, we ask LLMs to design a benchmarking experiment of EMO algorithms. Our experiments show that LLMs often suggest classical benchmark settings: Performance examination of NSGA-II, MOEA/D and NSGA-III on ZDT, DTLZ and WFG by HV and IGD under the standard parameter specifications.

Abstract: FPGA-based neuromorphic architectures pose a promising viewpoint on the future of computing, but the efforts in this domain are disorganized, without a clear classification scheme for implemented structures. This results in the lack of consensus on what is important for specific groups of neuromorphic systems, e.g., based on the platform they are implemented on or the intended use case. Here, we review the approach to implementing such architectures on FPGAs over the last 25 years. We propose a new taxonomy for those systems that could help the researchers better understand the closest environment their designs reside in and devise new metrics that could fairly grade them against the other ideas.

Abstract: We present the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel meta-heuristic method that hierarchically combines amortized inference and parallel stochastic search. Our method first leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to amortize a \emph{multi-modal} prior distribution over combinatorial solution space that encompasses both high-reward and diversified solutions. This prior is iteratively updated via parallel stochastic search in the spirit of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), leading to the posterior distribution that generates near-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments across seven combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate GFACS's promising performances.

Abstract: Memory Mosaics are networks of associative memories working in concert to achieve a prediction task of interest. Like transformers, memory mosaics possess compositional capabilities and in-context learning capabilities. Unlike transformers, memory mosaics achieve these capabilities in comparatively transparent way ("predictive disentanglement"). We illustrate these capabilities on a toy example and also show that memory mosaics perform as well or better than transformers on medium-scale language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is an Unconventional Computation model to perform computation on various different substrates, such as recurrent neural networks or physical materials. The method takes a 'black-box' approach, training only the outputs of the system it is built on. As such, evaluating the computational capacity of these systems can be challenging. We review and critique the evaluation methods used in the field of reservoir computing. We introduce a categorisation of benchmark tasks. We review multiple examples of benchmarks from the literature as applied to reservoir computing, and note their strengths and shortcomings. We suggest ways in which benchmarks and their uses may be improved to the benefit of the reservoir computing community.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07266">SemlaFlow -- Efficient 3D Molecular Generation with Latent Attention and Equivariant Flow Matching</a></h4>

Abstract: Methods for jointly generating molecular graphs along with their 3D conformations have gained prominence recently due to their potential impact on structure-based drug design. Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10253">Feedback Favors the Generalization of Neural ODEs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.10253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known generalization problem hinders the application of artificial neural networks in continuous-time prediction tasks with varying latent dynamics. In sharp contrast, biological systems can neatly adapt to evolving environments benefiting from real-time feedback mechanisms. Inspired by the feedback philosophy, we present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement. The feedback neural network is a novel two-DOF neural network, which possesses robust performance in unseen scenarios with no loss of accuracy performance on previous tasks.} A linear feedback form is presented to correct the learned latent dynamics firstly, with a convergence guarantee. Then, domain randomization is utilized to learn a nonlinear neural feedback form. Finally, extensive tests including trajectory prediction of a real irregular object and model predictive control of a quadrotor with various uncertainties, are implemented, indicating significant improvements over state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.

">Modeling Organoid Population Electrophysiology Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Improving models to investigate neurodegenerative disease, neurodevelopmental disease, neurotoxicology and neuropharmacology is critical to improve our basic understanding of the human nervous system, as well as to accelerate discovery of interventions and drugs. Improved models of the human central nervous system could enable critical discoveries related to functional changes induced by sensory stimulation or toxic exposures. Neural organoids, complex three-dimensional cell cultures derived from adult human stem cells, have been grown with complex connectivity and neuroanatomy. Moreover, these cultures have been interfaced with bi-directional electrical stimulation and recording, as well as chemical stimulation. This effort sought to develop new computational techniques which could be applied to comparative studies using neural organoids. In particular, we adapted CEBRA, a state of the art model from the \emph{in vivo} modeling literature, to generate 2D and 3D embeddings (projections into structured low-dimensional spaces) of high dimensional neural organoid electrophysiology data. This can be done in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. Results indicate these embeddings can be quickly and reliably generated and serve as a low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings for characterizing changes in neural organoid activity over time, as well as clustering results around known bursting phenomena. Moreover, we demonstrate that mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions can be used as a parametric model for these embedding spaces to enable statistics hypothesis testing. This technique may enable new types of comparative studies using neural organoids, and may be critical for creating a representation for quantitative comparison and validation of neural organoid models against human and animal data. Looking ahead, this work could allow the formulation of a new class of experiments investigating the functional impact of toxins, genetic manipulations, or pharmacological interventions on human neurons.

">Citrullination of TDP-43 is a key post-translation modification associated with structural and functional changes and progressive pathology in TDP-43 mouse models and human proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is associated with a spectrum of clinical dementias including limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological changes (LATE-NC). Post-translational modifications (PTM) are linked to TDP-43 toxic gain-of- function and cytoplasmic aggregation 1-3. Phosphorylation remains the most investigated PTM and a standard criterion for determining pathology progression and clinical subclassification in TDP-43 proteinopathies 4-7. However, full spectrum of PTMs on TDP-43 structure and biology remain unknown. Utilizing mass-spectrometry analysis we identified citrullination as a novel and irreversible bona fide PTM of TDP-43 protein. We recognized peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 and 4 (PAD2 and PAD4) to mediate the conversion of arginine (R) to citrulline (citR) in vitro and demonstrated increased PAD2 and PAD4 expression and TDP-43 citrullination in a human wildtype TDP-43 mouse model (Tg (Thy1-TARDBP4). Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis revealed citrullination induced vast structural changes while ThT analysis demonstrated altered aggregation kinetics of citrullinated (citR) TDP-43 protein. We further provided mechanistic evidence on reduced electrostatic and pi-pi interactions of citR TDP-43 Low Complexity Domain (LCD) with RNA, favoring liquid-solid phase separation and condensate formation. Generation and validation of several citR TDP-43 specific antibodies against several TDP-43 epitopes revealed epitope and domain-specific effects of citrullination on TDP-43 solubility in vivo. Importantly, we found distinct reactivities of citR TDP-43 antibodies shedding light into the contribution of epitope-specific properties of human citR TDP-43 to novel pathological citR TDP-43 assemblies in human brain tissue from LATE-NC, with or without comorbid Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). These findings provided a unique look into the temporal citR TDP-43 signatures, and the potential clinical relevance associated with progression of pure LATE-NC and comorbid ADNC + LATE-NC. Collectively, these data reveal the existence of irreversible TDP-43 citrullination at targeted sites via induced PAD2/ PAD4 activities, presenting a critical step in TDP-43 proteinopathy.

">An automated two-choice social operant task for probing moment-to-moment changes in social satiety</a></h4>

              
                In naturalistic conditions, animals must routinely make ongoing self-motivated choices about whether to initiate interactions with same or opposite-sex partners and whether to re-initiate social contact when interactions have ended. However, it remains unclear what governs these choices, and whether they are motivated by drive states that exhibit signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety when these interactions have ended. Here, to explicitly test this at the behavioral level, we designed a novel fully-automated two-choice social operant paradigm where individuals can choose between same and opposite-sex social rewards and rewards are delivered for interaction with systematically varying durations. We trained cohorts of both sexes on this task and quantified the patterns of choices. We used choice latency as a metric to infer moment-to-moment satiety to test whether increased interaction duration leads to increased moment-to-moment satiety. We find that although both males and females have stable choice biases across sessions, with males showing consistent opposite sex biases, only males exhibit behavioral signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety and are sensitive to the duration of interaction. Using a simple normative model to capture patterns of social choice, we observe that behavior is better fit by a model that has a single evolving social drive and choice bias, rather than a model with multiple, independent drives for same and opposite-sex interactions. Together, our data reveal behavioral signatures of social satiety and offer new insights into the underlying homeostatic and motivational drives that govern social choices.

">EasyEyes: Crowded Dynamic Fixation for Online Psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Online vision testing enables efficient data collection from diverse participants but requires accurate fixation. Fixation accuracy is traditionally ensured by using a camera to track gaze. That works well in the lab, but tracking during online testing with a built-in webcam is not yet sufficiently precise. Kurzawski, Pombo, et al. (2023) introduced a fixation task that improves fixation through hand-eye coordination, requiring participants to track a moving crosshair with a mouse-controlled cursor. This dynamic fixation task greatly reduces peeking at peripheral targets relative to a stationary fixation task, but does not eliminate it. Here, we enhance fixation further by leveraging "crowding," adding clutter around the fixation mark - a method we call crowded dynamic fixation. We assessed fixation accuracy during peripheral threshold measurement. Relative to the RMS gaze error during the stationary fixation task, dynamic fixation error was 61%, while crowded dynamic fixation error was only 47%. With a 1.5-degree tolerance, peeking occurred on 9% of trials with stationary fixation, 4% with dynamic fixation, and 0% with crowded dynamic fixation. This improvement eliminated implausibly low peripheral thresholds, likely by preventing peeking. We conclude that crowded dynamic fixation enables accurate gaze control for online testing.

">Behavioural and neurogenetic evidence for emotion primitives in the fruit fly Drosophila: insights from the Open Field Test</a></h4>

              
                Emotions, defined as transient states preparing organisms for adaptive responses, are thought to be based on evolutionarily conserved building blocks ("emotion primitives") that are present across mammalian and other vertebrate species. Whether and to which extent these building blocks are found in insects is largely undefined. In this study, we employ the open field test in fruit flies and focus on wall-following and total walking activity as behavioural indicators of emotion-like states. Wildtype and transgenic flies were subjected to various conditions, including social isolation, starvation, and exposure to anxiolytic substances prior to behavioural testing in the open field test. The results indicate that wall-following and total walking activity are modulated by these conditions, with generally increased wall-following observed under aversive stimuli and decreased values under positive conditions. Notably, the behaviour was consistent across different times of the day and independent of circadian rhythms. Genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory systems, such as serotonin, dopamine, and neuropeptide F, supports the role of these pathways in modulating emotion-like states in the fruit fly. Activation of reward-related neurons decreased wall-following, while inhibition increased it, aligning with known effects in mammalian models. Additionally, pharmacological treatments with ethanol and diazepam produced predictable changes in wall-following and total walking activity, reinforcing the validity of the open field test as a measure of emotion-like states in the fly. The findings suggest that Drosophila exhibits core emotion-like states, with wall-following and total walking activity serving as reliable indicators of emotional valence and arousal. Our results promote the use of Drosophila as a powerful genetic model to dissect the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of emotion primitives, shedding light on the evolution of basic emotional processing mechanisms.

">Amphetamine in Adolescence Induces a Sex-Specific Mesolimbic Dopamine Phenotype in the Adult Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Drugs of abuse in adolescence impact brain maturation and increase psychiatric risk, with differences in sensitivity between males and females. Amphetamine in adolescent male, but not female mice, causes dopamine axons intended to innervate the nucleus accumbens and to grow ectopically to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is mediated by drug-induced downregulation of the Netrin-1 receptor DCC. How off-target dopamine axons function in the adult PFC remains to be determined. Here we report that males and females show place preference for amphetamine in adolescence. However, only in males, amphetamine increases PFC dopamine transporter expression in adulthood: leading to aberrant baseline dopamine transients, faster dopamine release, and exaggerated responses to acute methylphenidate. Upregulation of DCC in adolescence, using CRISPRa, prevents all these changes. Mesolimbic dopamine axons rerouted to the PFC in adolescence retain anatomical and functional phenotypes of their intended target, rendering males enduringly vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs of abuse.

">Metaplastic priming enables non-ionotropic NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic depotentiation in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The reversal of learning-induced synaptic potentiation through depotentiation is thought to underlie forgetting and can be influenced by prior synaptic activity. Here, we evaluated how such metaplastic alterations manifest at the synaptic level. In hippocampal slices obtained from male and female mice, we artificially induced long-term potentiation (LTP) using either a temporally spaced or compressed stimulation pattern. Using a combination of electrophysiology and protein quantification approaches, we found divergent molecular pathways recruited during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Depotentiation of both forms of LTP required glutamatergic activation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). However, only depotentiation of spaced LTP required ionotropic NMDAR signaling, while ion flux-independent, or non-ionotropic, NMDAR signaling was necessary and sufficient for depotentiation of compressed LTP. Downstream of NMDAR signaling, AMPA receptor phosphorylation was also differentially modified during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Finally, we found that spaced but not compressed depotentiation required synaptic Arc. Together, our results reveal that the temporal pattern of prior LTP induction exerts a metaplastic influence on the molecular pathways recruited during the induction and expression of depotentiation. Our findings have important implications for the regulation of both physiological and pathological forgetting.

">Dynamically rich states in balanced networks induced by single-neuron dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Network states with rich dynamics and highly variable firing rates of individual neurons are prominent in experimental observations and thought to benefit complex information processing and learning. Such states have been proposed to arise from properties of network coupling, like a strong connectivity or slow synaptic dynamics. Here, we identify an alternative mechanism based on weak synaptic coupling and intrinsic cellular dynamics. We show that a switch in the cellular excitability class of action-potential generation (via a switch in the underlying mathematical bifurcation), further amplified by recurrent interactions, results in super-Poissonian spiking variability in random balanced networks. Information encoding is shifted to higher frequency bands and collective chaos in the network is enhanced when intrinsic cellular dynamics follow a saddle homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation. The robust effect links the biophysics of individual neurons to collective dynamics of large random networks, highlighting the relevance of single-cell dynamics for computation in physiological and artificial networks.

">Temporal Propagation of Neural State Boundaries in Naturalistic Context</a></h4>

              
                Our senses receive a continuous stream of complex information, which we segment into discrete events. Previous research has related such events to neural states: temporally and regionally specific stable patterns of brain activity. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether there was evidence for top-down or bottom-up propagation of neural state boundaries. To do so, we used intracranial measurements with high temporal resolution while subjects were watching a movie. As this is the first study of neural states in intracranial data in the context of event segmentation, we also investigated whether known properties of neural states could be replicated. The neural state boundaries indeed aligned with stimulus features and between brain areas. Importantly, we found evidence for top-down propagation of neural state boundaries at the onsets and offsets of clauses. Interestingly, we did not observe a consistent top-down or bottom-up propagation in general across all timepoints, suggesting that neural state boundaries could propagate in both a top-down and bottom-up manner, with the direction depending on the stimulus input at that moment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights on how neural state boundaries are shared across brain regions and strengthen the foundation of studying neural states in electrophysiology.

">Biologically realistic mean field model of spiking neural networks with fast and slow inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                We present a mean field model for a spiking neural network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with fast GABAA and nonlinear slow GABAB inhibitory conductance-based synapses. This mean field model can predict the spontaneous and evoked response of the network to external stimulation in asynchronous irregular regimes. The model displays theta oscillations for sufficiently strong GABAB conductance. Optogenetic activation of interneurons and an increase of GABAB conductance caused opposite effects on the emergence of gamma oscillations in the model. In agreement with direct numerical simulations of neural networks and experimental data, the mean field model predicts that an increase of GABAB conductance reduces gamma oscillations. Furthermore, the slow dynamics of GABAB synapses regulates the appearance and duration of transient gamma oscillations, namely gamma bursts, in the mean field model. Finally, we show that nonlinear GABAB synapses play a major role to stabilize the network from the emergence of epileptic seizures.

">Laterality and interhemispheric integration in the larval Drosophila olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                All animals with bilateral symmetry must integrate the sensory input from the left and right sides of their bodies to make coherent perceptual decisions. In Drosophila larvae, connectomic evidence suggests that olfactory signals from the two sides of the head are initially processed independently (as in the mammalian olfactory system) before being combined in the central brain. By pairing volumetric calcium imaging in intact larvae with microfluidic odor delivery and targeted laser ablation at the sensory periphery, we have mapped the propagation of olfactory signals between the two brain hemispheres, across successive layers of the larval olfactory system. This approach implicates the mushroom body (MB) as a key substrate for interhemispheric integration of odor representations. Whereas the two larval MBs appear to process odors largely independently at the level of their intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells), the modulatory neurons of the MB show strongly symmetrized responses to asymmetric olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, odor responses in some MB output neurons (MBONs), up to 5 synapses downstream from the sensory periphery, preserve information about stimulus laterality. Moreover, we show that asymmetric activation of these MBONs can modulate the animal's turning behavior in a side-biased manner. These findings suggest that the deeply lateralized architecture of the larval olfactory system balances the need for interhemispheric integration with the advantages of parallel sensory processing.

">Repulsive interactions instruct synaptic partner matching in an olfactory circuit</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit extraordinary precision in selecting synaptic partners. Whereas cell-surface proteins (CSPs) mediating attractive interactions between developing axons and dendrites have been shown to instruct synaptic partner matching, it is less clear the degree to which repulsive interactions play a role. Here, using a genetic screen guided by single cell transcriptomes, we identified three CSP pairs--Toll2-Ptp10D, Fili-Kek1, and Hbs/Sns-Kirre--in mediating repulsive interactions between non-partner olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons and projection neuron (PN) dendrites in the developing Drosophila olfactory circuit. Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select PN-ORN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP. Each CSP pair is also differentially expressed in other brain regions. Together, our data reveal that multiple repulsive CSP pairs work together to ensure precise synaptic partner matching during development by preventing neurons from forming connections with non-cognate partners.

">Shifted balance between ventral striatal prodynorphin and proenkephalin biases development of cocaine place avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Evidence from human self-report and rodent models indicate cocaine can induce a negative affective state marked by panic and anxiety, which may reduce future cocaine use or promote co-use with opiates. Dynorphin-mediated signaling within the striatum is associated with negative affect following cocaine withdrawal and stress-induced cocaine seeking. Here, we used a trace conditioning procedure to first establish the optimum parameters to capture this transient cocaine negative affective state in wild type mice, then we investigated striatal opioid peptides as a substrate mediating cocaine conditioned place avoidance (CPA). Previous reports indicate that trace conditioning, where drug administration occurs after removal from the conditioning chamber, results in CPA to ethanol, nicotine, and amphetamine. We tested different cocaine doses, conditioning session lengths, and apparatus types, to determine which combination yields the best cocaine CPA. Cocaine CPA was moderately larger at the highest cocaine dose (25 mg/kg), but this did not generalize across apparatus types and the effect was transient, thus data were collapsed across all parameters. Cocaine conditioning scores were variable, but also became more polarized across conditioning, with approximately equal proportions developing preference and avoidance. We then correlated cocaine CPA with striatal gene expression levels of the opioid peptides enkephalin (Penk) and dynorphin (Pdyn) using qPCR. Cocaine CPA was correlated with low Pdyn levels and a low Pdyn:Penk ratio in the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. Consistent with this, mice with higher striatal Pdyn relative to Penk were more resistant to developing cocaine CPA compared to littermate controls. This approach revealed a subset of subjects sensitive to the aversive state immediately following cocaine administration. Our findings suggest striatal dynorphin has opposing roles in mediating the aversion associated with acute cocaine intoxication versus cocaine withdrawal.

">Harnessing the Evolution of Proteostasis Networks to Reverse Cognitive Dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly conserved network essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and cognitive function. Here, we investigated how persistent ISR activation impacts cognitive performance, primarily focusing on a PPP1R15BR658C genetic variant associated with intellectual disability. By generating a novel mouse model that mimics this human condition, we revealed that this variant destabilizes the PPP1R15B-PP1 phosphatase complex, resulting in chronic ISR activation, impaired protein synthesis, and deficits in long-term memory. Importantly, we found that the cognitive and synaptic deficits in Ppp1r15bR658C mice are directly due to ISR activation. Leveraging insights from evolutionary biology, we characterized DP71L, a viral orthologue of PPP1R15B, through detailed molecular and structural analyses, uncovering its mechanism of action as a potent pan-ISR inhibitor. Remarkably, we found that DP71L not only buffers cognitive decline associated with a wide array of conditions, including Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease and aging, but also enhances long-term synaptic plasticity and memory in healthy mice. These findings highlight the promise of utilizing evolutionary insight to inform innovative therapeutic strategies.

">Rewiring an olfactory circuit by altering the combinatorial code of cell-surface proteins</a></h4>

              
                Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets, it remains largely unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here, we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) type, which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male-male courtship, we switched its connection from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type nearly completely to a new PN type that promotes courtship. To achieve this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attractive and repulsive interactions between synaptic partners. The anatomical switch changed the odor response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male-male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work demonstrates that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving ways to explore how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.

">Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation of central thalamus reduces arousal in healthy volunteers</a></h4>

              
                We present the first causal evidence in healthy humans linking central thalamus to vigilance and pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a measure of vigilance, and the Egly Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Pulvinar sonication resulted in more subtle effects consistent with a selective disruption of visuospatial attention. Specifically, participants were less responsive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the targeted pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for noninvasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of adjacent thalamic nuclei only millimeters apart.

">Smart Dura: a functional artificial dura for multimodal neural recording and modulation</a></h4>

              
                A multi-modal neural interface capable of long-term recording and stimulation is essential for advancing brain monitoring and developing targeted therapeutics. Among the traditional electrophysiological methods, micro-electrocorticography (ECoG) is appealing for chronic applications because it provides a good compromise between invasiveness and high-resolution neural recording. When combining ECoG with optical technologies, such as calcium imaging and optogenetics, this multi-modal approach enables the simultaneous collection of neural activity from individual neurons and the ability to perform cell-specific manipulation. While previous efforts have focused on multi-modal interfaces for small animal models, scaling these technologies to larger brains, of primates, remains challenging. In this paper, we present a multi-modal neural interface, named Smart Dura, a functional version of the commonly used artificial dura with integrated electrophysiological electrodes for large cortical area coverage for the NHP brain. The Smart Dura is fabricated using a novel thin-film microfabrication process to monolithically integrate a micron-scale electrode array into a soft, flexible, and transparent substrate with high-density electrodes (up to 256 electrodes) while providing matched mechanical compliance with the native tissue and achieving high optical transparency (exceeding 97%). Our in vivo experiments demonstrate electrophysiological recording capabilities combined with neuromodulation, as well as optical transparency via multiphoton imaging. This work paves the way toward a chronic neural interface that can provide large-scale, bidirectional interfacing for multimodal and closed-loop neuromodulation capabilities to study cortical brain activity in non-human primates, with the potential for translation to humans.

">Shapley Fields Reveal Chemotopic Organization in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb Across Diverse Chemical Feature Sets</a></h4>

              
                Representations of chemical features in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb (OB) are not well-understood, unlike the neural code for stimuli of the other sensory modalities. This is because the space of olfactory stimuli lacks a natural coordinate system, and this significantly complicates characterizing neural receptive fields (tuning curves), analogous to those in the other sensory modalities. The degree to which olfactory tuning is spatially organized across the OB, often referred to as chemotopy, is also not well-understood. To advance our understanding of these aspects of olfactory coding, we introduce an interpretable method of Shapley fields, as an olfactory analog of retinotopic receptive fields. Shapley fields are spatial distributions of chemical feature importance for the tuning of OB glomeruli. We used this tool to investigate chemotopy in the OB with diverse sets of chemical features using widefield epifluorescence recordings of the mouse dorsal OB in response to stimuli across a wide range of the chemical space. We found that Shapley fields reveal a weak chemotopic organization of the chemical feature sensitivity of dorsal OB glomeruli. This organization was consistent across animals and mostly agreed across very different chemical feature sets: (i) the expert-curated PubChem database features and (ii) features derived from a Graph Neural Network trained on human olfactory perceptual tasks. Moreover, we found that the principal components of the Shapley fields often corresponded to single commonly accepted chemical classification groups, that therefore could be "recovered" from the neural activity in the mouse OB. Our findings suggest that Shapley fields may serve as a chemical feature-agnostic method for investigating olfactory perception.

">Local cues enable classification of image patches as surfaces, object boundaries, or illumination changes</a></h4>

              
                To correctly parse the visual scene, one must detect edges and determine their underlying cause. Previous work has demonstrated that image-computable neural networks trained to differentiate natural shadow and occlusion edges exhibited sensitivity to boundary sharpness and texture differences. Although these models showed a strong correlation with human performance on an edge classification task, this previous study did not directly investigate whether humans actually make use of boundary sharpness and texture cues when classifying edges as shadows or occlusions. Here we directly investigated this using synthetic image patch stimuli formed by quilting together two different natural textures, allowing us to parametrically manipulate boundary sharpness, texture modulation, and luminance modulation. In a series of initial training experiments, observers were trained to correctly identify the cause of natural image patches taken from one of three categories (occlusion, shadow, uniform texture). In a subsequent series of test experiments, these same observers then classified 5 sets of synthetic boundary images defined by varying boundary sharpness, luminance modulation, and texture modulation cues using a set of novel parametric stimuli. These three visual cues exhibited strong interactions to determine categorization probabilities. For sharp edges, increasing luminance modulation made it less likely the patch would be classified as a texture and more likely it would be classified as an occlusion, whereas for blurred edges, increasing luminance modulation made it more likely the patch would be classified as a shadow. Boundary sharpness had a profound effect, so that in the presence of luminance modulation increasing sharpness decreased the likelihood of classification as a shadow and increased the likelihood of classification as an occlusion. Texture modulation had little effect on categorization, except in the case of a sharp boundary with zero luminance modulation. Results were consistent across all 5 stimulus sets, showing these effects are not due to the idiosyncrasies of the particular texture pairs. Human performance was found to be well explained by a simple linear multinomial logistic regression model defined on luminance, texture and sharpness cues, with slightly improved performance for a more complicated nonlinear model taking multiplicative parameter combinations into account. Our results demonstrate that human observers make use of the same cues as our previous machine learning models when detecting edges and determining their cause, helping us to better understand the neural and perceptual mechanisms of scene parsing.

">Examining Alzheimer's Disease Modifiable Risk Factors: Impact of Physical Activity and Diet on Neuroanatomy and Behaviour in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Dementia, a global public health challenge, is significantly influenced by lifestyle factors such as obesity. This study examines the impact of obesity and intervention approaches -physical exercise, a low-fat diet, or both- on brain structure in a triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTgAD) and wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet. Volumetric and deformation-based morphometry analyses showed significant neuroanatomical differences related to genotype and a high-fat diet, particularly affecting the hippocampus and cerebellum. Diet and exercise interventions partially mitigate these effects. Volume changes were correlated with behavioural data, producing a unique brain-behaviour signature tied to intervention-driven neuroanatomy improvements. This pattern was correlated with gene expression patterns, identifying modules of genes related to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and fatty acid transportation. Overall, interventions promote changes that seem to counteract some of the effects of a high-fat diet, influencing biological processes that support brain health.

">Reduced harmonic complexity of brain parenchymal cardiovascular pulse waveforms in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by specific neuropathologies, and is associated with arterial wall {beta}-amyloid accumulations, which lead to radiologically detectable amplitude increases and variable propagation speed of cardiovascular impulses in brain. In this study, we developed a fast frequency domain imaging method know as relative harmonic power of magnetic resonance encephalography (MREGRHP), aiming to investigate the configuration of the cardiovascular impulses independently of the mean magnetic resonance signal intensity and physiological impulse amplitude. In the initial analyses in healthy controls, we found that a wide 0.8 - 5Hz bandpass produced the most physiologically realistic cardiovascular waveforms. Whereas the data recorded in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from flip angle (FA) of 25{degrees} yielded up to 7-fold higher cardiac signal intensity as compared to FA of 5{degrees}, within the brain tissue recordings with FA of 5{degrees} were markedly more sensitive to cardiac waveform. We detected arterial impulses originating from major arteries and extending into the surrounding brain parenchyma, with simultaneous dampening of amplitude as a function of distance from source. Finally, we compared MREGRHP results in 34 AD patients (mean age: 60.7{+/-}4.7 years; 53% female) against 29 controls (mean age: 56.9{+/-}7.9 years; 66% female). We show that the harmonic power of cardiovascular brain pulses is significantly reduced in cortical frontoparietal areas of AD patients, indicating monotonous impulse patterns colocalizing with the previously reported areas of increased impulse propagation speed. In conclusion, the MREGRHP offers a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based method to non-invasively quantify and locate human arterial blood vessel wall pathology.

">Atypical functional connectome in congenitally blind humans</a></h4>

              
                The cortex is organized along macroscale structural and functional gradients that extend from unimodal to transmodal association areas and from somatosensory to visual regions. It has not been tested whether this organization represents an intrinsic neuro-architecture immune to sensory experience or depends on sensory input. Here, we conducted connectome gradient analyses using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in congenitally blind individuals and sighted controls. In both groups, we observed a principal gradient (G1) extending from unimodal to transmodal, a second gradient (G2) spanning from somatosensory to visual, and a third gradient (G3) separating the frontoparietal network from the rest of the brain. Our findings indicate that the macroscale organization of the cortex develops largely independently of sensory experience. However, in blind individuals, the sensorimotor network was more distanced from the visual network (G2), while the visual network was more integrated with transmodal (G1) and frontoparietal (G3) networks. In blind individuals, the hierarchical organization within the early visual cortex was altered, the structure-function coupling in visual and temporal areas was reduced, and functional similarity between V1 center and periphery disappeared. These results suggest a critical role of sensory input in shaping the macroscale functional and structural organization of the brain.

">Human brain cell-type-specific aging clocks based on single-nuclei transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, yet the cell-type-specific progression of brain aging remains poorly understood. Here, we developed human cell-type-specific transcriptomic aging clocks using high-quality single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from post mortem human prefrontal cortex tissue of 31 donors aged 18-94 years, encompassing 73,941 high-quality nuclei. We observed distinct transcriptomic changes across major cell types, including upregulation of inflammatory response genes in microglia from older samples. Aging clocks trained on each major cell type accurately predicted chronological age and remained robust in independent single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, underscoring their broad applicability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of cell-type-specific transcriptomic clocks to measure biological aging in the human brain and highlight potential mechanisms of selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. We anticipate these clocks will serve as a basis for further studies in other brain regions and more diverse populations, ultimately advancing our understanding of age-related neurodegenerative processes at the single-cell level.

">Parietal cortex is recruited by frontal and cingulate areas to support action monitoring and updating during stopping</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence indicates that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) may play a causal role in action stopping, potentially representing a novel neuromodulation target for inhibitory control dysfunctions. Here, we leverage intracranial recordings in human subjects to establish the timing and directionality of information flow between IPS and prefrontal and cingulate regions during action stopping. Prior to successful inhibition, information flows primarily from the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a critical inhibitory control node, to IPS. In contrast, during stopping errors the communication between IPS and IFG is lacking, and IPS is engaged by posterior cingulate cortex, an area outside of the classical inhibition network and typically associated with default mode. Anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex also display performance-dependent connectivity with IPS. Our functional connectivity results provide direct electrophysiological evidence that IPS is recruited by frontal and anterior cingulate areas to support action plan monitoring/updating, and by posterior cingulate during control failures.

">Profiling local translatomes and RNA binding proteins of somatosensory neuronsreveals specializations of individual axons</a></h4>

              
                Individual neurons have one or more axons that often extend long distances and traverse multiple microenvironments. However, it is not known how the composition of individual axons is established or locally modulated to enable neuronal function and plasticity. Here, we use spatial translatomics to identify local axonal translatomes in anatomically and functionally specialized neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). DRG neurons extend long central and peripheral axons in opposite directions and distinct microenvironments to enable somatosensation. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNA sequencing, we generated a comprehensive resource of mRNAs preferentially translated within each axon. Locally translated proteins include pain receptors, ion channels, and translational machinery, which establish distinct electrophysiologic properties and regenerative capacities for each axon. We identify RNA-binding proteins associated with sorting and transporting functionally related mRNAs. These findings provide resources for addressing how axonal translation shapes the spatial organization of neurons and enables subcellular neuroplasticity.

">MICROGLIAL EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES MEDIATE C1Q DEPOSITION AT THE PRE-SYNAPSE AND PROMOTE SYNAPTIC PRUNING</a></h4>

              
                C1q is released by microglia, localizes on weak synapses and acts as a tag for microglial synaptic pruning. However, how C1q tags synapses during the pruning period remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that C1q is delivered by microglia to pre-synaptic sites that externalize phosphatidylserine through extracellular vesicles. Using approaches to increase or reduce vesicles production in microglia, by C9orf72 knock out or pharmacological inhibition respectively, we provided mechanistic evidence linking extracellular vesicle release to pre-synaptic remodelling in neuron-microglia cultures. In C9orf72 knockout mice, we confirmed larger production of microglial extracellular vesicles, and showed augmented C1q presynaptic deposition associated with enhanced engulfment by microglia in the early postnatal hippocampus. Finally, we provide evidence that microglia physiologically release more vesicles during the period of postnatal circuit refinement. These findings implicate abnormal release of microglial extracellular vesicles in both neurodevelopmental and age-related disorders characterized by dysregulated microglia-mediated synaptic pruning.

">EEG reveals online monitoring mechanisms of speech production</a></h4>

              
                Speaking involves the orchestration of multiple speech muscles while actively monitoring sensory consequences through auditory and somatosensory feedback. A mistuned sensorimotor mechanism may disrupt the normal integration of motor and auditory brain systems in several developmental and acquired motor speech disorders, including stuttering, speech apraxia, speech sound disorders and dysarthria. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive measure of online neural activity with potential to assess (deficiencies in) sensorimotor integration during speech production. However, the relation between EEG and continuous speech output remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigate prediction of auditory speech output using multivariate EEG patterns under three levels of auditory masking. A decoding analysis was employed in combination with a lag-based approach that allowed studying predictions based on instantaneous EEG-speech relations, and their involvement in feedforward and feedback processes. For all masking conditions, we found consistent decoding in instantaneous lags and speech feedback lags, but not in feedforward lags. Furthermore, the level of auditory masking modulated decoding in both the instantaneous and feedback lags. Our results provide insights of neural monitoring during online speech production and offer a window to further study the dysfunction latent in motor speech disorders that may help in optimizing brain-informed therapies for speech fluency.

">Mapping the ISR Landscape in Cognitive Disorders via single-cell multi-omics</a></h4>

              
                Persistent activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) is a major driver of cognitive decline in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Using a new mouse model (Ppp1r15bR658C mice) that mimics the persistent ISR activation and cognitive decline observed in humans, we generated the first single-cell ISR atlas of the brain. By integrating single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq with proteomics, we discovered that distinct brain cell types respond differently to persistent ISR activation and elicit cell-type-specific ISR programs. Interestingly, chromatin accessibility analyses revealed that the ISR downstream factor ATF4 is a key ISR effector in GABAergic neurons, while AP-1 (JUNB) is implicated in glutamatergic neurons. More importantly, selective deletion of ATF4 in GABAergic neurons, but not in glutamatergic neurons, impacts ISR-mediated cognitive decline in Ppp1r15bR658C mice, demonstrating that different neuronal subtypes rely on unique ISR downstream effectors to regulate mnemonic processes. Furthermore, we defined a comprehensive molecular signature of persistent ISR activation, which we showed could serve as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction across neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative disorders and normal aging. This multi-omic framework provides a key platform for exploring and validating new scientific hypotheses, significantly advancing our understanding of ISR-related brain disorders.

">Revealing the mechanisms underlying latent learning with successor representations</a></h4>

              
                Latent learning experiments were critical in shaping Tolman's cognitive map theory. In a spatial navigation task, latent learning means that animals acquire knowledge of their environment through exploration, without explicit reinforcements. Animals pre-exposed in this way perform better on a subsequent learning task than those that were not. This learning enhancement is dependent on the specific design of the pre-exposure phase. Here, we investigate latent learning and its modulation using computational modeling based on the deep successor representation (DSR), a recent model for cognitive map formation. Our results confirm experimental observations in that exploration aligned with the future reward location significantly improves reward learning compared to random or no exploration. This effect generalizes across different action selection strategies. We show that these performance differences follow from the spatial information encoded in the structure of the DSR acquired in the pre-exposure phase. In summary, this study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying latent learning and how such learning shapes cognitive maps, impacting their effectiveness in goal-directed spatial tasks.

">The astrocyte Fabp7 gene regulates diurnal seizure threshold and activity-dependent gene expression in mice</a></h4>

              
                Epileptic seizures are often influenced by time-of-day and changes in vigilance state, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning these associations remain poorly understood. Astrocytes, a pivotal type of glial cell, play a critical role in modulating neuronal excitability and circadian rhythms, and they express Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7 (Fabp7), a molecule vital for sleep regulation, lipid signaling, and gene transcription. This study investigates the role of Fabp7 in determining time-of-day dependent seizure susceptibility. We assessed electroshock seizure thresholds in male C57/BL6N wild-type (WT) and Fabp7 knockout (KO) mice. Results demonstrated that, compared to WT mice, Fabp7 KO mice displayed significantly elevated general and maximal electroshock seizure thresholds (GEST and MEST) during the dark phase, but not during the light phase. To explore the impact of Fabp7 on activity-dependent gene expression during seizures, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on cortical and hippocampal tissues from WT and Fabp7 KO mice following MEST and SHAM procedures during the dark period. While immediate early genes (IEGs) showed considerable differential expression between WT-MEST and WT-SHAM, this expression was absent in Fabp7 KO-MEST compared to Fabp7 KO-SHAM. Gene ontology analyses revealed significant overlaps between the WT-MEST:WT-SHAM and Fabp7 KO-SHAM:WT-SHAM comparisons, indicating that the basal mRNA expression profiles in Fabp7 KO brains resemble those of WT brains in a post-ictal state. Collectively, these findings suggest that Fabp7 is a key regulator of time-of-day dependent neural excitability and that astrocyte-mediated signaling pathways involving Fabp7 interact with neuronal activity to influence gene expression in response to seizures.

To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal–parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein–protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.</span>

While structural neuroimaging has shown a characteristic pattern of edema and white matter injury, no functional neuroimaging studies of maple syrup urine disease have been performed. Using widefield optical imaging, we investigated resting-state functional connectivity in two brain-specific mouse models of maple syrup urine disease (an astrocyte-specific knockout and a whole-brain knockout). At 8 weeks, mouse functional neuroimaging was performed using a custom-built widefield optical imaging system. Imaging was performed before and after initiation of a high-protein diet for 1 week to mimic metabolic crisis, which we hypothesized would result in decreased functional connectivity strength. Data were analyzed using seed-based functional connectivity and cluster-based inference. Astrocyte-specific knockout mice developed increased contralateral functional connectivity within the posteromedial somatosensory cortex after diet initiation. Whole-brain knockout mice had a similar pattern present at baseline, which persisted after diet initiation. Thus, contrary to expectations, maple syrup urine disease resulted in increased functional connectivity strength, especially after diet initiation. While the underlying etiology of these changes is unclear, these results demonstrate that inborn errors of metabolism result in changes to functional connectivity networks. Further research may demonstrate functional neuroimaging biomarkers that could be translated to clinical care.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A substantial body of literature has focused on neural signals evoked by errors emerging during the execution of goal-directed actions. It is still unclear how motor cortex activity during movement execution relates to feedback error processing. To investigate this, we recorded primary motor cortex (M1) single-unit activity in rats during a grasping task. About half of the recorded neurons showed modulation of their firing activity that did not depend on success or failure, which we termed outcome-independent neurons. Other neurons showed a difference in their discharge profile when comparing successful and unsuccessful trials, which we called outcome-dependent neurons. Among both outcome-dependent and -independent neurons, we further distinguished neurons presenting their maximum firing rate in specific epochs as defined by the task. We compared the cortical distribution of outcome-independent and outcome-dependent neurons to cortical maps of complex forelimb movements evoked by intracortical microstimulation in additional animals. The majority of outcome-independent neurons was localized within the limb extension and paw open-closure movement representations. Outcome-dependent neurons were not clearly associated to particular motor representations. Cortical arrangement of neurons, both outcome-independent and outcome-dependent, and their correlation with distinct movement representations, can serve as indicator for anticipating potential outcomes before the conclusion of an action.</span>

Here, we investigated the effects of subchronic phencyclidine on the binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the rat brain using positron emission tomography. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injection of either phencyclidine (10 mg/kg) or physiological saline once daily, a total of 15 times. positron emission tomography scans were performed twice, before and after drug administration, using <sup>18</sup>F-altanserin, a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor radioactive marker. Two behavioral tests, the sociability test and the social interaction test, were performed before each positron emission tomography scan. The social interaction time was significantly shortened by subchronic phencyclidine. The BP<sub>ND</sub> of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors was significantly increased after subchronic phencyclidine administration in the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral hippocampus, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex. The BP<sub>ND</sub> change between the pre- and postdrug periods in the ventral hippocampus showed a significant negative correlation (<span style="font-style:italic;">r</span> = 0.73) with that of the social interaction time change. Our results suggest that upregulation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the ventral hippocampus may play a role in disturbed social ability and the development of negative symptoms.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Advanced meditation has been associated with long- and short-term psychological changes such as bliss, profound insight, and transformation of well-being. However, most advanced meditation neuroimaging analyses have implemented primarily spatially-localized approaches, focusing on discrete regional changes in activity rather than distributed dynamics. The present study uses a geometric eigenmode decomposition of ultrahigh field-strength 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from an intensely sampled case study to investigate the complex, distributed cortical dynamics associated with advanced concentrative absorption meditation. Geometric eigenmode decomposition of advanced concentrative absorption meditation and non-meditative control task fMRI data revealed elevated global brain state power and energy patterns of specific advanced concentrative absorption meditation states compared to controls, with mid-frequency spectrum brain state power and energy following a non-random, cubic trajectory through the advanced concentrative absorption meditation sequence. Further, these brain state differences were meaningfully associated with subjective phenomenological reports of attention, intensity of advanced concentrative absorption meditation quality, and sensations. This study unites precise methodological design, a novel fMRI decomposition framework, and rigorous phenomenology to provide valuable insights into the distributed neural signatures of highly refined conscious states. These results underscore similarities and differences between advanced concentrative absorption meditation and other altered states of consciousness like those induced by psychedelics—offering insights into refined conscious states and their implications for health and well-being.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Listeners implicitly use statistical regularities to segment continuous sound input into meaningful units, eg transitional probabilities between syllables to segment a speech stream into separate words. Implicit learning of such statistical regularities in a novel stimulus stream is reflected in a synchronization of neural responses to the sequential stimulus structure. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that neural tracking of the statistical stimulus structure is reduced in individuals with dyslexia who have weaker reading and spelling skills, and possibly also weaker statistical learning abilities in general, compared to healthy controls. To this end, adults with and without dyslexia were presented with continuous streams of (non-speech) tones, which were arranged into triplets, such that transitional probabilities between single tones were higher within triplets and lower between triplets. We found that the so-called Triplet Learning Index (ie the ratio of neural phase coherence at the triplet rate relative to the tone rate) was lower in adults with dyslexia compared to the control group. Moreover, a higher Triplet Learning Index was associated with better spelling skills. These results suggest that individuals with dyslexia have a rather broad deficit in processing structure in sound instead of a merely phonological deficit.</span>

                <p><i>GBA1</i> variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (<i>ATP10D</i>), not <i>GBA1</i>, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in <i>GBA1</i>-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Abstract Mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare but life-threatening, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality after operative repair. They frequently present at a late stage with sepsis and rupture; therefore, emergency management is paramount. Repair options, particularly in the thoracic aorta, are complex and include open, endovascular, and hybrid surgical approaches. We present the case of a 72-year-old woman with a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm who underwent successful endovascular repair with thoracic stent graft placement and left subclavian artery embolization. This case highlights the successful use of endovascular repair for the management of a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm in zone 2, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and potential benefits of minimally invasive repair in these rare complex cases.

                In 2024 the Cross-Strait Conflict between Taipei and Beijing turned 75 years old. Using an eclectic conflict analysis framework, this paper lays out the evolution of the conflict, its main actors, and traces the fundamental shift of its core-issue from “who is China” to “what is Taiwan.” Realist concepts of international relations are used to argue that it is important to imagine political scenarios not ending in warfare to escape the escalatory spiral and a self-fulfilling prophecy. The rhetoric of warfare, distorted views on history, and Great Power competition are destabilizing factors that push toward an escalation that will result in warfare if they are not counterbalanced by refocusing the relationship on common ground. A peaceful way forward, the paper argues, does not need to solve the underlying conflict between the PRC and the ROC, it only needs to mitigate their red lines long enough for new reconciliation strategies to emerge that re-channel the core-issue into a constructive conflict, which, over time, can lead to permanent reconciliation.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                <p>by Jung M. Park, Li-Huei Tsai</p>

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003043">Incomplete recombination suppression fuels extensive haplotype diversity in a butterfly colour pattern supergene</a></h4>

Supergenes can evolve when recombination-suppressing mechanisms like inversions promote co-inheritance of alleles at two or more polymorphic loci that affect a complex trait. Theory shows that such genetic architectures can be favoured under balancing selection or local adaptation in the face of gene flow, but they can also bring costs associated with reduced opportunities for recombination. These costs may in turn be offset by rare ‘gene flux’ between inverted and ancestral haplotypes, with a range of possible outcomes. We aimed to shed light on these processes by investigating the BC supergene, a large genomic region comprising multiple rearrangements associated with three distinct wing colour morphs in <i>Danaus chrysippus</i>, a butterfly known as the African monarch, African queen and plain tiger. Using whole-genome resequencing data from 174 individuals, we first confirm the effects of BC on wing colour pattern: background melanism is associated with SNPs in the promoter region of <i>yellow</i>, within an inverted subregion of the supergene, while forewing tip pattern is most likely associated with copy-number variation in a separate subregion of the supergene. We then show that haplotype diversity within the supergene is surprisingly extensive: there are at least six divergent haplotype groups that experience suppressed recombination with respect to each other. Despite high divergence between these haplotype groups, we identify an unexpectedly large number of natural recombinant haplotypes. Several of the inferred crossovers occurred between adjacent inversion ‘modules’, while others occurred within inversions. Furthermore, we show that new haplotype groups have arisen through recombination between two pre-existing ones. Specifically, an allele for dark colouration in the promoter of <i>yellow</i> has recombined into distinct haplotype backgrounds on at least two separate occasions. Overall, our findings paint a picture of dynamic evolution of supergene haplotypes, fuelled by incomplete recombination suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-244/v1?src=rss">Scaling up community participation in watershed management for food security improvement: the case of Qarsa woreda , East Haraghe zone, Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The watershed management approach has been well-acknowledged as an effective strategy for improving food security. However, the significance of community engagement, which is vital for the success of this strategy, has not been adequately acknowledged. The study examined the level of community involvement and the factors influencing their participation in watershed management. Methods A household survey of 337 household heads, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, a people participation index, and a binary regression model were used for data analysis. Result The results of the people participation index indicated a moderate level of farmers’ participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation phases, with no significant differences observed between the three micro watersheds. However, there were variations in the indicator metrics within and across the micro watersheds, with participants from the Sustainable Land Management Program II (SLMPII), micro watershed showing significant differences compared to those from the Productive Safety Net Public work (PSNP_PW) and free mass mobilization at levels of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. The results of binary logistic regression indicated that the overall level of farmer participation was significantly affected by the frequency of extension contact, livestock ownership, education level, family size, and group membership. Conclusions The study highlights the need to consider variability in indicator measurements for effective watershed management to improve food security. It stresses the importance of building farmers’ capacity and fostering ownership, rather than simply providing them with explícitas instructions to follow.

                Background The nursing workforce is crucial in healthcare systems worldwide and contributes to community well-being. also, Nurses experience numerous psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral shocks and challenges in their work. In Jordan, 43% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of burnout, around 55% experience high levels of emotional exhaustion, and 33% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of psychological pressure and job stress. Others found that 70% of nurses experience stress. these issues can be reduced by practicing self-care and psychological flow which impact in work-related tasks which are important in effectively addressing occupational stress healthily and soundly. This study aims to determine assessing the predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses Methods This study follows the quantitative technique. sample consisting of 476 nurses in Amman Jordan was chosen. Three scales were adapted to meet the study objectives: Occupational stress scale, Self-care scale, and psychological flow scale. There validity and reliability were checked. Results The study results indicate that self-care and psychological flow levels were low with means of 2.32 and 2.13, while the occupational stress level was high with a mean of 3.91. Also, there are a predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses. Conclusions This study shows that of self-care and psychological flow predict occupational stress among nurses, which helps us to manage the occupational stress among them by giving them self-care and psychological flow practices and healing time during work by group counseling and lectures.

                Ford et al. show that depleting 60S subunits and altering ribosomal stoichiometry activates the iRQC pathway. The ubiquitin-binding kinase RIOK3 is a new iRQC factor that facilitates 40S degradation. The iRQC pathway utilizes a feedforward mechanism of autoregulation where iRQC-stimulating conditions increase RNF10 and RIOK3 expression.

                The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region associated with episodic memory. Garvert et al. show that time-encoding cells are present in the RSC but rare in nearby neocortical areas. These findings suggest that the RSC is a key brain region for encoding time in episodic memory.

                Noritake et al. show that distinct populations of macaque dorsomedial prefrontal neurons encode reward prediction error for self and others at overlapping times. This finding suggests that the primate brain has cellular-level mechanisms whereby an observer can concurrently update the causal structure of the external environment for self and others.

                Laniado et al. show that retinal orientation encoding relies on two non-orthogonal sensors with topographic variation matching retinal spherical geometry. This encoding enables differing decoding schemes in retinorecipient targets; OSGCs may act as global ensembles without retinotopy, yet provide retinotopically mapped inputs to the colliculus, thalamus, and cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94917">Bridging the 3D geometrical organisation of white matter pathways across anatomical length scales and species</a></h4>

              
                We used diffusion MRI and x-ray synchrotron imaging on monkey and mice brains to examine the organisation of fibre pathways in white matter across anatomical scales. We compared the structure in the corpus callosum and crossing fibre regions and investigated the differences in cuprizone-induced demyelination in mouse brains versus healthy controls. Our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation that apply despite the varying patterns observed across species; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed laminar structures with varying angles, according to the characteristics of major pathways. Fasciculi exhibited non-straight paths around obstacles like blood vessels, comparable across the samples of varying fibre complexity and demyelination. Quantifications of fibre orientation distributions were consistent across anatomical length scales and modalities, whereas tissue anisotropy had a more complex relationship, both dependent on the field-of-view. Our study emphasises the need to balance field-of-view and voxel size when characterising white matter features across length scales.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98102">Secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is predictive of nucleotide substitution frequency</a></h4>

              
                Accurate estimation of the effects of mutations on SARS-CoV-2 viral fitness can inform public-health responses such as vaccine development and predicting the impact of a new variant; it can also illuminate biological mechanisms including those underlying the emergence of variants of concern. Recently, Lan et al. reported a model of SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure and its underlying dimethyl sulfate reactivity data (Lan et al., 2022). I investigated whether base reactivities and secondary structure models derived from them can explain some variability in the frequency of observing different nucleotide substitutions across millions of patient sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. Nucleotide basepairing was compared to the estimated ‘mutational fitness’ of substitutions, a measurement of the difference between a substitution’s observed and expected frequency that is correlated with other estimates of viral fitness (Bloom and Neher, 2023). This comparison revealed that secondary structure is often predictive of substitution frequency, with significant decreases in substitution frequencies at basepaired positions. Focusing on the mutational fitness of C→U, the most common type of substitution, I describe C→U substitutions at basepaired positions that characterize major SARS-CoV-2 variants; such mutations may have a greater impact on fitness than appreciated when considering substitution frequency alone.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98351">An image-computable model of speeded decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are the dominant framework for modeling response time (RT) data from speeded decision-making tasks. While providing a good quantitative description of RT data in terms of abstract perceptual representations, EAMs do not explain how the visual system extracts these representations in the first place. To address this limitation, we introduce the visual accumulator model (VAM), in which convolutional neural network models of visual processing and traditional EAMs are jointly fitted to trial-level RTs and raw (pixel-space) visual stimuli from individual subjects in a unified Bayesian framework. Models fitted to large-scale cognitive training data from a stylized flanker task captured individual differences in congruency effects, RTs, and accuracy. We find evidence that the selection of task-relevant information occurs through the orthogonalization of relevant and irrelevant representations, demonstrating how our framework can be used to relate visual representations to behavioral outputs. Together, our work provides a probabilistic framework for both constraining neural network models of vision with behavioral data and studying how the visual system extracts representations that guide decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97894">Adaptive chunking improves effective working memory capacity in a prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia circuit</a></h4>

              
                How and why is working memory (WM) capacity limited? Traditional cognitive accounts focus either on limitations on the number or items that can be stored (slots models), or loss of precision with increasing load (resource models). Here, we show that a neural network model of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia can learn to reuse the same prefrontal populations to store multiple items, leading to resource-like constraints within a slot-like system, and inducing a trade-off between quantity and precision of information. Such ‘chunking’ strategies are adapted as a function of reinforcement learning and WM task demands, mimicking human performance and normative models. Moreover, adaptive performance requires a dynamic range of dopaminergic signals to adjust striatal gating policies, providing a new interpretation of WM difficulties in patient populations such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, and schizophrenia. These simulations also suggest a computational rather than anatomical limit to WM capacity.

                <p>Transgenic mice provide unprecedented access to manipulate and visualize neural circuits; however, those on a C57BL/6 background develop progressive hearing loss, significantly confounding systems-level and behavioral analysis. While outbreeding can limit hearing loss, it introduces strain variability and complicates the generation of complex genotypes. Here, we propose an approach to preserve hearing by crossing transgenic mice with congenic B6.CAST-<I>Cdh23<sup>Ahl</sup></I><sup>+</sup> mice, which maintain low-threshold hearing into adulthood. Widefield and two-photon imaging of the auditory cortex revealed that 2.5-month-old C57BL/6 mice exhibit elevated thresholds to high-frequency tones and widespread cortical reorganization, with most neurons responding best to lower frequencies. In contrast, <I>Ahl+</I> C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust neural responses across tested frequencies and sound levels (4&ndash;64&nbsp;kHz, 30&ndash;90&nbsp;dB SPL) and retained low thresholds into adulthood. Our approach offers a cost-effective solution for generating complex genotypes and facilitates more interpretable systems neuroscience research by eliminating confounding effects from hearing loss.</p>

                Background Cayratia trifolia has been extensively studied for its bioactive components and medicinal properties. This study was carried out to evaluate the fermentation ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.1 yeast to determine suitable fermentation conditions. Methods The suitable initial sugar content, temperature, and incubation time were investigated in the fermentation in the 100-milliliter flask scale. Besides, a trial fermentation at the 1-liter scale was conducted to assess yeast performance. Results All treatments showed that the total sugar content decreased after 9 days of fermentation compared to the initial level. Temperature during fermentation has a direct effect on yeast activity. Temperature increases the growth of yeast and the speed of enzyme activity. The fermentation time changes depending on temperature, initial soluble solid contents, and yeast strains, leading to changes in the ethanol content after the end of fermentation. The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to ferment at room temperature with an initial pH of 4.5, 24 °Brix, and a yeast density of 107 cells/mL. The appropriate fermentation conditions determined for S. cerevisiae 2.1 were 24 °Brix and incubation at room temperature (28-33°C) with a fermentation time of 11 days. In 1-L scale fermentation, three-leaf cayratia wine had 9.46% (v/v) and the fermentation efficiency was 90.34%. The wine produced had a unique color, flavor, and aroma that met the sensory evaluation of the Vietnamese national standard TCVN-3217:79. Concusion The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to produce wine from Cayratia trifolia extract in suitable conditions with high ethanol content and organoleptic values. The results of this study supplied needed information for further studies on analysis of bioactive compounds produced by the fermentation.

                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability (BEW) and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies (AUP) are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. AST was found to have a significant positive effect on IPL and ISL, while CMT and CNV significantly influenced IPL and IQL, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of BEW toward IPL, ISL, and IQL for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1542/v2?src=rss">Assessment of occupational noise‐related hearing impairment among dental health personnel [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to examine the occupational noise related hearing impairment among dentists and to know the need for efforts to reduce its impact on young dentists. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled between the age of 22 years to 33 years having a mean age of 25.60 years. The sound level meter is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that before the procedure has started the mean general sound level in the clinics is 61.70 dB while during the procedure this mean sound level rises to 73.38dB suggesting there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment as males had a hearing mean of 58.37dB before the start of procedure which increased to 63.36dB during the procedure and after the procedure the mean is 61.91dB; while for the females it was 58.60dB before the start of procedure while during the procedure the mean increased to 64.51dB and after the procedure the mean is 61.03dB suggesting an eminent impairment in the hearing ability even though the procedure is completed. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels. Although there are few noise cancellation devices in the market, dental professionals need something that is specific to their requirements, because commercially available products are built and developed for other purposes. Our study was not able to highlight which procedures have a greater noise impact to suggest specific recommendations.

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                <p>by Alexandra Teslya, Janneke Cornelia Maria Heijne, Maarten Franciscus Schim van der Loeff, Ard van Sighem, Jacob Aiden Roberts, Maartje Dijkstra, Godelieve J de Bree, Axel Jeremias Schmidt, Kai J Jonas, Mirjam E Kretzschmar, Ganna Rozhnova</p>

The number of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands has been decreasing, but additional efforts are required to bring it further down. This study aims to assess the impact of increased diagnosis of early HIV infection combined with immediate antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation on reducing HIV transmission among MSM. We developed an agent-based model calibrated to HIV surveillance and sexual behavior data for MSM in the Netherlands in 2017-2022. Starting in 2023, we simulated a 10-year intervention that accelerates HIV diagnosis during the first 3 or 6 months after HIV acquisition across five levels of increased diagnosis rates (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-fold), followed by immediate ART initiation. The upper limit of the intervention’s impact over 10 years is projected to result in the cumulative 298 (95-th QI: 162–451) HIV infections averted. A 32-fold increase in the diagnosis rate within 3 months after HIV acquisition (corresponding to 100% of all new HIV infections diagnosed within 3 months of acquisition) results in 269 (95-th QI: 147–400) infections averted, approaching closely maximum impact. By extending the scope of the intervention to individuals who acquired HIV infection within the previous 6 months, a smaller 8-fold increase in the diagnosis rate (corresponding to 97% of new HIV infections diagnosed within 6 months of acquisition) approaches closely the maximum impact of the intervention by averting 256 (95-th QI: 122–411) HIV infections. Our sensitivity analyses showed, that in an epidemiological context similar to the modern-day the Netherlands, immediate initiation of ART accompanying accelerated diagnosis of individuals with early HIV infection does not significantly affect HIV transmission dynamics. Accelerating early HIV diagnosis through increased awareness, screening, and testing can further reduce transmission among MSM. Meeting this goal necessitates a stakeholder needs assessment.

                <p>The physiological basis of cognitive decline remains largely uncharacterized. We identified a protein panel signature, in living humans, that correlates to improvement in neurocognition over a period of 5 years. Our signature is composed of complement proteins, coagulation cascade, and extracellular matrix regulators. In our cohort, SERPINF1 is associated with greater maximal oxygen uptake after an aerobic exercise intervention. Sleep quality is also a key factor in relation to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, which was associated with greater sleep efficiency. Additionally, we validate that the coagulation profile of decliners’ plasma contains procoagulant agonists, leading to greater platelet activation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
