              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02351">MindSimulator: Exploring Brain Concept Localization via Synthetic FMRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-selective regions within the human cerebral cortex exhibit significant activation in response to specific visual stimuli associated with particular concepts. Precisely localizing these regions stands as a crucial long-term goal in neuroscience to grasp essential brain functions and mechanisms. Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns. Using the synthetic recordings, we successfully localize several well-studied concept-selective regions and validate them against empirical findings, achieving promising prediction accuracy. The feasibility opens avenues for exploring novel concept-selective regions and provides prior hypotheses for future neuroscience research.

                arXiv:2503.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groove sensations arise from rhythmic structures that evoke an urge to move in response to music. While syncopation has been extensively studied in groove perception, the neural mechanisms underlying low-frequency groove remain underexplored. This fMRI study examines the role of the mirror neuron system and associated brain regions in processing low-frequency groove. Region-of-interest analysis revealed that amplifying drum and bass components in K-pop songs significantly increased activity in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior/superior parietal lobules, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral posterior middle/inferior temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that low-frequency grooves engage sensorimotor, executive, and rhythm semantics networks, reinforcing their role in action-related processing. Building on these insights, we propose an enhanced rhythmic auditory stimulation paradigm for Parkinson's disease, incorporating amplified low-frequency rhythmic cues to improve gait synchronization.

                arXiv:2503.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven benchmarks have led to significant progress in key scientific modeling domains including weather and structural biology. Here, we introduce the Zebrafish Activity Prediction Benchmark (ZAPBench) to measure progress on the problem of predicting cellular-resolution neural activity throughout an entire vertebrate brain. The benchmark is based on a novel dataset containing 4d light-sheet microscopy recordings of over 70,000 neurons in a larval zebrafish brain, along with motion stabilized and voxel-level cell segmentations of these data that facilitate development of a variety of forecasting methods. Initial results from a selection of time series and volumetric video modeling approaches achieve better performance than naive baseline methods, but also show room for further improvement. The specific brain used in the activity recording is also undergoing synaptic-level anatomical mapping, which will enable future integration of detailed structural information into forecasting methods.

                arXiv:2503.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in synthesising realistic neural data, yet their potential for unsupervised representation learning in resting-state EEG remains under explored. In this study, we implement a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate multi-channel resting-state EEG data and assess the quality of the synthesised signals through both visual and feature-based evaluations. Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be fine-tuned for age group classification, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline. These findings suggest that generative models can serve not only as EEG data generators but also as unsupervised feature extractors, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based unsupervised learning for EEG analysis, suggesting avenues for more data-efficient deep learning applications in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02685">TReND: Transformer derived features and Regularized NMF for neonatal functional network Delineation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01906">Learning to Chain Operations by Routing Information Through a Global Workspace</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.

                arXiv:2503.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning in the brain is local and unsupervised (Hebbian). We derive the foundations of an effective human language model inspired by these microscopic constraints. It has two parts: (1) a hierarchy of neurons which learns to tokenize words from text (whichiswhatyoudowhenyoureadthis); and (2) additional neurons which bind the learned symanticless patterns of the tokenizer into a symanticful token (an embedding). The model permits continuous parallel learning without forgetting; and is a powerful tokenizer which performs renormalization group. This allows it to exploit redundancy, such that it generates tokens which are always decomposable into a basis set (e.g an alphabet), and can mix features learned from multiple languages. We find that the structure of this model allows it to learn a natural language morphology WITHOUT data. The language data generated by this model predicts the correct distribution of word-forming patterns observed in real languages, and further demonstrates why microscopically human speech is broken up into words. This model provides the basis for understanding the microscopic origins of language and human creativity.

                arXiv:2406.15665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.

                arXiv:2407.19214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool in neuroscience and clinical practice for monitoring and analyzing brain activity. Traditional neural network models, such as EEGNet, have achieved considerable success in decoding EEG signals but often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in quantum computing present new opportunities to enhance machine learning models through quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a novel hybrid neural network that integrates quantum computing with the classical EEGNet architecture to improve EEG encoding and analysis, as a forward-looking approach, acknowledging that the results might not always surpass traditional methods but it shows its potential. QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise. Our results highlight the significant potential of quantum-enhanced neural networks in EEG analysis, suggesting new directions for both research and practical applications in the field.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09862">Towards a Quantitative Theory of Digraph-Based Complexes and its Applications in Brain Network Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.09862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we developed new mathematical methods for analyzing network topology and applied these methods to the analysis of brain networks. More specifically, we rigorously developed quantitative methods based on complexes constructed from digraphs (digraph-based complexes), such as path complexes and directed clique complexes (alternatively, we refer to these complexes as "higher-order structures," or "higher-order topologies," or "simplicial structures"), and, in the case of directed clique complexes, also methods based on the interrelations between the directed cliques, what we called "directed higher-order connectivities." This new quantitative theory for digraph-based complexes can be seen as a step towards the formalization of a "quantitative simplicial theory." Subsequently, we used these new methods, such as characterization measures and similarity measures for digraph-based complexes, to analyze the topology of digraphs derived from brain connectivity estimators, specifically the estimator known as information partial directed coherence (iPDC), which is a multivariate estimator that can be considered a representation of Granger causality in the frequency-domain, particularly estimated from electroencephalography (EEG) data from patients diagnosed with left temporal lobe epilepsy, in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands, to try to find new biomarkers based on the higher-order structures and connectivities of these digraphs. In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions: How does the higher-order topology of the brain network change from the pre-ictal to the ictal phase, from the ictal to the post-ictal phase, at each frequency band and in each cerebral hemisphere? Does the analysis of higher-order structures provide new and better biomarkers for seizure dynamics and also for the laterality of the seizure focus than the usual graph theoretical analyses?

                arXiv:2412.17820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity, analyzed using non-Euclidean network geometry, to predict the surgery outcome in TLE. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely utilized hyperbolic embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. The prediction model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the value of non-Euclidean representation of brain networks in gaining deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.

Abstract: Classical models of memory in psychology and neuroscience rely on similarity-based retrieval of stored patterns, where similarity is a function of retrieval cues and the stored patterns. While parsimonious, these models do not allow distinct representations for storage and retrieval, despite their distinct computational demands. Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework.

We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.

Abstract: The Psycho Frame, a sophisticated system primarily used in Universal Century (U.C.) series mobile suits for NEWTYPE pilots, has evolved as an integral component in harnessing the latent potential of mental energy. Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Reconstructing the intricate local morphology of neurons and their long-range projecting axons can address many connectivity related questions in neuroscience. The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.

                arXiv:2503.00080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in neuroscience and clinical research for analyzing brain activity. While deep learning models such as EEGNet have shown success in decoding EEG signals, they often struggle with data complexity, inter-subject variability, and noise robustness. Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) offer new opportunities to enhance EEG analysis by leveraging quantum computing's unique properties. In this study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a hybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate its generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a diverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's performance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that while QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in certain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods remain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages in EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that must be addressed for future advancements.

                arXiv:2503.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions builds on the assumption of symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment tend to circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they are known to scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, we show how SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks as compared to Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, we show how our proposed mechanism effectively enables the alignment of feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors.

                arXiv:2503.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the continuous deepening of low-carbon emission reduction policies, the manufacturing industries urgently need sensible energy-saving scheduling schemes to achieve the balance between improving production efficiency and reducing energy consumption. In energy-saving scheduling, reasonable machine states-switching is a key point to achieve expected goals, i.e., whether the machines need to switch speed between different operations, and whether the machines need to add extra setup time between different jobs. Regarding this matter, this work proposes a novel machine multi states-based energy saving flexible job scheduling problem (EFJSP-M), which simultaneously takes into account machine multi speeds and setup time. To address the proposed EFJSP-M, a kind of discrete differential evolution particle swarm optimization algorithm (D-DEPSO) is designed. In specific, D-DEPSO includes a hybrid initialization strategy to improve the initial population performance, an updating mechanism embedded with differential evolution operators to enhance population diversity, and a critical path variable neighborhood search strategy to expand the solution space. At last, based on datasets DPs and MKs, the experiment results compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the feasible of EFJSP-M and the superior of D-DEPSO.

                arXiv:2503.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents the Goat Optimization Algorithm (GOA), a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by goats' adaptive foraging, strategic movement, and parasite avoidance behaviors.GOA is designed to balance exploration and exploitation effectively by incorporating three key mechanisms, adaptive foraging for global search, movement toward the best solution for local refinement, and a jump strategy to escape local optima.A solution filtering mechanism is introduced to enhance robustness and maintain population diversity. The algorithm's performance is evaluated on standard unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions, demonstrating significant improvements over existing metaheuristics, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Comparative analysis highlights GOA's superior convergence rate, enhanced global search capability, and higher solution accuracy.A Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms the statistical significance of GOA's exceptional performance. Despite its efficiency, computational complexity and parameter sensitivity remain areas for further optimization. Future research will focus on adaptive parameter tuning, hybridization with other metaheuristics, and real-world applications in supply chain management, bioinformatics, and energy optimization. The findings suggest that GOA is a promising advancement in bio-inspired optimization techniques.

Abstract: This paper proposes a strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network (SPTC-AN-FOZNN) model, meticulously designed for addressing time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems. This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0<\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.

                arXiv:2503.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mathematical framework that unifies neural population dynamics, hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SpWR) generation, and cognitive consistency constraints inspired by Heider's theory. Our model leverages low-dimensional manifold representations to capture structured neural drift and incorporates a balance energy function to enforce coherent synaptic interactions, effectively simulating the memory consolidation processes observed in biological systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach not only reproduces key features of SpWR events but also enhances network interpretability. This work paves the way for scalable neuromorphic architectures that bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering more robust and adaptive learning mechanisms for future intelligent systems.

                arXiv:2503.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting synthetic tabular data is essential to prevent the distribution of false or manipulated datasets that could compromise data-driven decision-making. This study explores whether synthetic tabular data can be reliably identified across different tables. This challenge is unique to tabular data, where structures (such as number of columns, data types, and formats) can vary widely from one table to another. We propose four table-agnostic detectors combined with simple preprocessing schemes that we evaluate on six evaluation protocols, with different levels of ''wildness''. Our results show that cross-table learning on a restricted set of tables is possible even with naive preprocessing schemes. They confirm however that cross-table transfer (i.e. deployment on a table that has not been seen before) is challenging. This suggests that sophisticated encoding schemes are required to handle this problem.

                arXiv:2308.10373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising neurally-inspired model of computation, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present the first study that draws inspiration from neural homeostasis to design a threshold-adapting leaky integrate-and-fire (TA-LIF) neuron model and utilize TA-LIF neurons to construct the adversarially robust homeostatic SNNs (HoSNNs) for improved robustness. The TA-LIF model incorporates a self-stabilizing dynamic thresholding mechanism, offering a local feedback control solution to the minimization of each neuron's membrane potential error caused by adversarial disturbance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates favorable dynamic properties of TA-LIF neurons in terms of the bounded-input bounded-output stability and suppressed time growth of membrane potential error, underscoring their superior robustness compared with the standard LIF neurons. When trained with weak FGSM attacks (attack budget = 2/255) and tested with much stronger PGD attacks (attack budget = 8/255), our HoSNNs significantly improve model accuracy on several datasets: from 30.54% to 74.91% on FashionMNIST, from 0.44% to 35.06% on SVHN, from 0.56% to 42.63% on CIFAR10, from 0.04% to 16.66% on CIFAR100, over the conventional LIF-based SNNs.

                arXiv:2411.00803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a dataset of one-dimensional powder diffraction patterns was designed with new strategy to train Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting space groups. The diffraction pattern was calculated based on lattice parameters and Extinction Laws, instead of the traditional approach of generating it from a crystallographic database. This paper demonstrates that the new strategy is more effective than the conventional method. As a result, the model trained on the cubic and tetragonal training set from the newly designed dataset achieves prediction accuracy that matches the theoretical maximums calculated based on Extinction Laws. These results demonstrate that machine learning-based prediction can be both physically reasonable and reliable. Additionally, the model trained on our newly designed dataset shows excellent generalization capability, much better than the one trained on a traditionally designed dataset.

Abstract: We formalize a novel modeling framework for achieving interpretability in deep learning, anchored in the principle of inference equivariance. While the direct verification of interpretability scales exponentially with the number of variables of the system, we show that this complexity can be mitigated by treating interpretability as a Markovian property and employing neural re-parametrization techniques. Building on these insights, we propose a new modeling paradigm -- neural generation and interpretable execution -- that enables scalable verification of equivariance. This paradigm provides a general approach for designing Neural Interpretable Reasoners that are not only expressive but also transparent.

                arXiv:2502.20265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the prevalence of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges associated with algorithm configuration. However, making an RL agent work properly is a non-trivial task, especially in reward design, which necessitates a substantial amount of handcrafted knowledge based on domain expertise. In this work, we study the importance of reward design in the context of DAC via a case study on controlling the population size of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA optimizing OneMax. We observed that a poorly designed reward can hinder the RL agent's ability to learn an optimal policy because of a lack of exploration, leading to both scalability and learning divergence issues. To address those challenges, we propose the application of a reward shaping mechanism to facilitate enhanced exploration of the environment by the RL agent. Our work not only demonstrates the ability of RL in dynamically configuring the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA, but also confirms the advantages of reward shaping in the scalability of RL agents across various sizes of OneMax problems.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bruxism and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are common conditions of the stomatognathic system. Some studies suggest a potential link with traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is gaining increasing interest among researchers. The aim of this scoping review is to map the available evidence on the association between TBI and bruxism or TBI and TMDs. Methods: The review was conducted by analyzing four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration database. A total of 340 studies were reviewed in this work, and 4 studies examining the connections between TBI were included in the analysis (with n = 3 focusing on the association between bruxism and TBI, and n = 1 on the association between TMDs and TBI). Results: Analyzing the publications on bruxism and TMDs in relation to TBI, at this stage it can be concluded that there is no solid evidence confirming the impact of TBI on the studied conditions. This is due to the quantity and quality of the collected evidence. Conclusions: In light of the presented review, it must be concluded that the quantity and quality of the evidence are insufficient to assert that TBI is a factor in the onset of bruxism or TMDs. Further research on this phenomenon is recommended, particularly focusing on the effects of different severities of TBI and various regions of brain injury.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Impaired balance leads to loss of function, e.g., the inability to walk safely. Therefore, restoring balance is a common goal of rehabilitation after a stroke. An innovative motor imaging and robotic device, the Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro walking table, was used to improve balance in patients who had suffered an acute stroke. Materials and Methods: Sixty-six stroke patients in the acute phase with an average age of 64.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.62 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups (22 subjects each) and treated with different therapies (conventional, conventional with Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro, and conventional with Erigo&amp;amp;reg;Pro enriched with motor imaging). The duration of therapy was two weeks. Patients were assessed before and after completion of therapy. The study used the trunk stability test and the Berg Balance Scale to assess balance, and the Riablo&amp;amp;trade; device to measure static balance. In addition, an assessment of the superficial tension of the transversus abdominis and multifidus muscles was performed. The clinical trial registration URL unique identifier was NCT06276075. Results: In each of the groups studied, the therapies applied resulted in significant improvement in functional assessment of trunk stability and balance (TCT &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 and BBS &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The assessment of balance in the frontal (p = 0.023) and sagittal (p = 0.074) planes with the Riablo&amp;amp;trade; device confirmed the superiority of motor imaging-enhanced therapy at the level of a statistical trend. The tension of the transversus abdominis was higher at the second measurement (M = 14.41; SE = 3.31). Conclusions: Motor imagery-enhanced therapy is most important, both for trunk stability and functional improvement of body balance parameters and for increasing transversus abdominis muscle tension.</p>

	<p>Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often demonstrate both cognitive and physical dysfunctions, particularly with greater age and lower physical activity levels, and there is evidence of a relationship between these outcomes (i.e., cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling) in MS. To date, little is known about cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling when controlling for chronological age and levels of physical activity. Objectives: We examined cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling in people with MS while accounting for chronological age and physical activity. Methods: The sample included 290 people with MS between the ages of 22 and 77 years. Participants underwent the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) for cognitive processing speed and the California Verbal Learning and Memory Test&amp;amp;ndash;Second Edition (CVLT-II) for verbal learning and memory. Participants completed the 6-Minute Walk and the Timed 25-Foot Walk tests for walking endurance and speed, respectively. Participants wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: The bivariate correlation analyses indicated that cognitive function had moderate-to-strong associations with motor function (range of rs between 0.433 and 0.459). The linear regression analyses indicated cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling between SDMT and motor function (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.139 and 0.145) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. The regression analyses further indicated that the CVLT-II was associated with motor function (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.125 and 0.135) when controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. When age and MVPA were entered into the regression analyses, SDMT was still associated with the motor function of individuals (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.119), and CVLT-II was still associated with the motor function of individuals (with a range of &amp;amp;beta; between 0.115 and 0.124). Conclusions: Cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;motor coupling is present in people with MS independent of chronological age and levels of physical activity. This warrants further investigation of the underlying mechanism and potential approaches for the management of co-occurring MS-related dysfunction.</p>

                <p>Facial paralysis is characterized by an injury to the facial nerve, causing the loss of the functions of the structures that it innervates, as well as changes in the motor cortex. Current models have some limitations for the study of facial paralysis, such as movement restriction, the absence of studying awake animals in behavioral contexts, and the lack of a model that fully evaluates facial movements. The development of an algorithm capable of automatically inferring facial paralysis and overcoming the existing limitations is proposed in this work. In C57/BL6J mice, we produced both irreversible and reversible facial paralysis. Video recordings were made of the faces of paralyzed mice to develop an algorithm for detecting facial paralysis applied to mice, which allows us to predict the presence of reversible and irreversible facial paralysis automatically. At the same time, the algorithm was used to track facial movement during gustatory stimulation and extracellular electrophysiological recordings in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). In the basal state, mice can make facial expressions, whereas the algorithm can detect this movement. Simultaneously, such movement is correlated with the activation in the ALM. In the presence of facial paralysis, the algorithm cannot detect movement. Furthermore, it predicts that the condition exists, and the neuronal activity in the cortex is affected with respect to the evolution of facial paralysis. This way, we conclude that the facial paralysis algorithm applied to mice allows for inferring the presence of experimental facial paralysis and its neuronal correlates for further studies.</p>

                Background Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a highly prevalent subclinical inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with growth failure, impaired neurocognitive development, poor response to oral vaccines, and micronutrient deficiencies. However, EE research and clinical trials are hampered by the lack of non-invasive tools for measuring intestinal function in detail. This study aims to develop new tools for the measurement of multiple domains of gut functional capacity. Methods The GI TOOLS project is a cross-sectional study that will recruit adults aged 18-65 years with EE in Lusaka, Zambia. Each participant will undergo assessment of gut functional capacity using novel near-point-of-care tools and provide multiple samples for detailed laboratory analyses. Participants will also undergo endoscopy for collection of duodenal biopsies. Novel techniques include stable isotopes approaches to measuring digestion, absorption, and bidirectional transmucosal amino acid flux, a non-invasive fluorescence tool for real-time evaluation of gut permeability, and assessment of reverse permeation of intravenous antibiotics to be carried out separately in Zimbabwe. Stool and duodenal microbiome sequencing using MinION sequencing, metabolome analysis applied to plasma and intestinal fluids, blood immune cell phenotyping, in vitro epithelial barrier models, and duodenal immunohistochemistry will also be used to explore EE in depth. These will all be integrated with gold standard histology and mucosal morphometry, alongside lactulose permeation data, and stool and plasma biomarker analysis. The protocol has been approved by ethics committees and regulators in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the UK. Participants will give informed consent before they can participate Anticipated outcomes Based on this extensive phenotyping, tests will be developed which can be simplified and refined for use in adults and children with EE, and for clinical trials. Findings from this project will be disseminated through in-person meetings with caregivers and regulatory bodies, presentations at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

                Background WPT information combines the power source with the load to provide energy through technology instead of using a wire. People are concerned about the safety and health implications of wireless power transfer even though it is already being used in devices like cell phones, electric cars, and medical devices. Methods Here this concern research work has used a survey method to gather information from a diverse group of people, focusing on various demographic factors and educational aspects. The research has analysed the knowledge of people regarding the application of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Further it has accumulated the safety aspects of using it in public or private places. However, the concerns of propel perspectives basing on their age, gender or other factors about safety of WPT is inducted within this survey. Results the finding from the survey within this research has demonstrated that many people are not much aware of WPT technologies, and some are worried about safety aspects of this concern technology within public places. From this result it has been seen that groups considering the age, education and gender has different perspective regarding the application and safety of WPT. The results have shown that people need to be taught more about it and to be made more aware of it. In addition, survey has showed that about 38% of respondent has some concerns about WPT technologies, which means that a significant number of people know about it. Conclusions From this analysis it has been interpreted that it is important to talk about safety worries and false facts about WPT. This concern paper has the potential to develop awareness about this technology. However, it is expected that future studies should look at more types of people and explore their personal experiences to figure out why people have different opinions about WPT.

                Background Studies have shown that perceived self-efficacy can influence teachers’ emotional state, thoughts and behaviours, and students’ learning. It’s also an important referential of professional satisfaction. Teaching theories influence learning, human development, motivation levels and, consequently, continuity of practice in favour of healthy lifestyle. Research on aquatic educators and teaching theories is both limited and essential, as aquatic literacy is considered a vital component of physical literacy, enabling individuals to better interact with aquatic environments. Methods For this study we used an online questionnaire, aimed at aquatic educators, which was answered voluntarily and anonymously to 1) assess the professionals’ perception of self-efficacy; 2) which teaching theories are most used by aquatic educators and 3) identify the teaching theory used by professionals who perceive themselves as most effective. It has been deposited and can be consulted at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27316242.v1. Results All teaching theories can generate a feeling of self-efficacy in teachers despite having different results, with the theories that involve students more actively (cognitivist and constructivist) being those that generate a greater feeling of self-efficacy in teachers. Comprehensive Aquatic Method (MAC) is a method that is more closely related to theories focused on active student participation and, consequently, it is a theory that generates a high perception of self-efficacy in teachers. Conclusions Levels of self-efficacy influence aquatic educators satisfaction, educator physical, mental and emotional health, as well as student learning. Is recommended that aquatic educators give prevalence to the cognitivist and constructivist teaching theories being MAC a privileged methodology approach for promoting active lifestyle habits throughout life.

                Introduction Lower extremity amputations (LEA) impact the quality of life and physical abilities and increase the risk of developing secondary complications. While most research focuses on major LEA, minor LEA remain understudied despite their rising incidence. These amputations alter the sensorial and mechanical properties of the foot, affecting postural control and stability. Understanding these biomechanical changes is essential for improving rehabilitation strategies. Objectives The scoping review will synthesize current research on postural control deficits following a minor LEA, focusing on any resections through or distal to the ankle joint. It will also evaluate whether interventions, such as orthotic devices and balance rehabilitation programs, have been investigated to mitigate balance impairments in this population. Inclusion criteria The scoping review will include studies on individuals with a minor LEA, across various age, levels, and etiologies. The scoping review will focus on quantitative data related to standing balance and postural control, dynamic functional tests, and self-reported questionnaires on balance capacity and confidence. Studies assessing interventions for postural control restoration will be analyzed separately as a secondary outcome. Methods A preliminary search of MEDLINE (PubMed) was conducted to develop a full search strategy aimed at compiling all existing scientific articles on postural control and balance in individuals with a minor LEA. The subsequent comprehensive search will be performed across multiple databases and grey literature. Two independent reviewers will independently extract the data. The Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Assessment Tool will be used to assess risk of bias and quality of included studies. Discussion By mapping the literature on postural control in individuals with a minor LEA, the scoping review will highlight knowledge gaps and provide guidelines for future biomechanical and postural research protocols. It will also assess the current state of therapeutic intervention research as a secondary outcome, providing insights for clinical rehabilitation strategies.

                Effective research depends on building on the knowledge found in the scientific literature. Designed to streamline literature tasks, the EPA’s Abstract Sifter literature tool, now at version 8, has been continually extended and enhanced since its introduction in 2017[1]. Early enhancements to the tool have primarily focused on core tasks common to all researchers. For example, citation retrieval from PubMed has been made faster and the returned citation threshold increased to 10,000. Features that allow deeper examination of the literature have been introduced as well. A functionality called Term-mapping allows for fast, dynamic relevancy ranking of returned citations. MeSH substances, such as proteins, genes, and chemicals, can now be extracted from a retrieved corpus of citations, ranked by frequency and explored through the MeSHMine functionality. Features that facilitate user engagement with publications have also been improved: formatting and colorization ease reviewing of the abstract text and the tagging and noting citations functionality has been streamlined. Version 8 introduced multiple features that break new ground in working with chemical literature. For example, chemical entity extraction from scientific publications has been streamlined through download of PDFs and automated table extraction. Following entity extraction, the chemical names can be used as inputs to retrieve EPA’s chemical identifiers, the DSSTox chemical IDs (DTXSIDs). Once these identifiers have been retrieved, a wealth of chemical information is available through built-in functions accessing EPA’s Computational Toxicology and Exposure application programming interface (CTX-APIs) [2]. This new functionality allows researchers to build on the EPA’s efforts in chemical data assembly and curation. The Abstract Sifter version 8 is a valuable tool for researchers endeavoring to understand chemicals and their effects on the environment and biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-259/v1?src=rss">Metabolic predictors and risk stratification of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia: A retrospective analysis and predictive machinery model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia remains a significant surgical complication with varying reported incidence rates. While traditional focus has centered on surgical factors, the role of metabolic predictors in calcium homeostasis disturbances remains incompletely understood. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 1,760 thyroidectomy patients based on data obtained from King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Saudi Arabia, evaluating metabolic predictors and long-term calcium homeostasis patterns. Preoperative assessment included thyroid function tests, glycemic control, vitamin D status, and anthropometric measurements. We have followed the TRIPOD + AI statement which provide updated guidance for reporting clinical prediction models that use regression or machine learning methods, We developed a risk stratification model using multivariate logistic regression and implemented mixed-effects modeling for longitudinal analysis. Recovery patterns were evaluated through standardized follow-up at immediate postoperative, one-month, three-month, six-month, and one-year timepoints. Results Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia occurred in 585 patients (33.2%, 95% CI: 31.0-35.4%). Preoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels appeared to be the strongest predictor (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.71-2.93, p<0.0001), followed by T3 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19-1.51) and glycated hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A1C), (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30). Our risk stratification system, including TSH, vitamin D, and immediate postoperative calcium, achieved superior discrimination (AUC=0.921) and effectively categorized patients into low (6.5%), intermediate (14.6%), and high-risk (83.2%) groups. Recovery patterns revealed a non-linear trajectory, with an unexpected decline at six months (79.71%) before maximal improvement at one year (88.61%). Conclusions Our findings highlight and demonstrate the significant role of metabolic factors in post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia risk and challenge the current standard recovery assumptions, suggesting the need for extended monitoring protocols and comprehensive metabolic assessment in perioperative management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-258/v1?src=rss">Large language models and GenAI in education: Insights from Nigerian in-service teachers through a hybrid ANN-PLS-SEM approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education offers transformative opportunities to enhance teaching and learning. Among these innovations, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT hold immense potential for instructional design, personalized learning, and administrative efficiency. However, integrating these tools into resource-constrained settings such as Nigeria presents significant challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, digital inequities, and teacher readiness. Despite the growing research on AI adoption, limited studies focus on developing regions, leaving a critical gap in understanding how educators perceive and adopt these technologies. Methods We adopted a hybrid approach, combining Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to uncover both linear and nonlinear dynamics influencing behavioral intention (BI) of 260 Nigerian in-service teachers regarding ChatGPT after participating in structured training. Key predictors examined include Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PUC), Attitude Towards ChatGPT (ATC), Your Colleagues and Your Use of ChatGPT (YCC), Technology Anxiety (TA), Teachers’ Trust in ChatGPT (TTC), and Privacy Issues (PIU). Results Our PLS-SEM results highlight PUC, TA, YCC, and PEU, in that order of importance, as significant predictors, explaining 15.8% of the variance in BI. Complementing these, ANN analysis identified PEU, ATC, and PUC as the most critical factors, demonstrating substantial predictive accuracy with an RMSE of 0.87. This suggests that while PUC drives adoption, PEU and positive attitudes are foundational in fostering teacher engagement with AI technologies. Conclusion Our results highlight the need for targeted professional development initiatives to enhance teachers’ digital competencies, reduce technology-related anxiety, and build trust in AI tools like ChatGPT. Our study offers actionable insights for policymakers and educational stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of fostering an inclusive and ethical AI ecosystem. We aim to empower teachers and support AI-driven educational transformation in resource-limited environments by addressing contextual barriers.

                Objective This study aimed to examine the mediating role of meal planning in the relationship between role modeling and snack choice. Methods and Measures The study was correlational and quantitative in nature. The study selected a sample of 403 university students. We collected data through interviews using a questionnaire. We analyzed the data using SPSS 23.0.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1989, 2015) (Build 1607) and AMOS 23.0.0 (IBM Corp; 1983, 2015) (Build 1607) software for correlational and Confirmatory factor tests. We used the bootstrapping technique to test for the mediation effect of meal planning. Results Meal planning had a full mediation effect between role modeling and snack choice. This means that Role modeling had a significant influence on meal planning, meal planning had a significant influence on snack choice, and role modeling had no significant influence on snack choice. Conclusion when young people admire other people’s eating habits it leads them to plan their meals and choose similar snacks to their role models. Future studies should consider studying the effect that role models’ proximity has on snack choices among young people in other contexts.

                Background Indomethacin (IND) belongs to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed for treatment of rheumatoid diseases and linked to the development of gastric ulcers in many people. Cranberry is a rich source of polyphenols and flavonoids, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods This study aimed to evaluate the activity of cranberry aqueous extract on IND-induced gastric ulcers in albino rats. Twenty-four adult male rats were sequentially assigned to four groups of six each. The control group consumes distilled water (DW) orally for 15 days. The IND (induction) group received a single oral dosage (60 mg/kg) of IND. The omeprazole (OMP) group got 60 mg/kg of IND as a single oral dose and then 20 mg/kg/day of OMP for 15 days. The cranberry group was given a single dose of IND 60 mg/kg orally and subsequently 200 mg/kg/day of cranberry aqueous extract for 15 days. Rats were euthanized on day 16, and gastric tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological evaluations. Results Cranberry extract considerably ameliorated the severity of IND-induced gastric ulcerations and fixed histological deteriorations. Furthermore, IND-exposed rats treated with cranberry extract exhibited dramatically lower serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers like TNF-α and IL-6, but higher levels of anti-oxidative biomarkers like SOD and GPx. The bioactive flavonoids and polyphenols content of cranberry extract could possibly account for its profound gastroprotective effects. The anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of cranberry extract could be a promising strategy for ameliorating the IND-aggravated gastrotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100570">Deuterium metabolic imaging phenotypes mouse glioblastoma heterogeneity through glucose turnover kinetics</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors with dismal prognosis. One of the main bottlenecks for developing more effective therapies for glioblastoma stems from their histologic and molecular heterogeneity, leading to distinct tumor microenvironments and disease phenotypes. Effectively characterizing these features would improve the clinical management of glioblastoma. Glucose flux rates through glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation have been recently shown to quantitatively depict glioblastoma proliferation in mouse models (GL261 and CT2A tumors) using dynamic glucose-enhanced (DGE) deuterium spectroscopy. However, the spatial features of tumor microenvironment phenotypes remain hitherto unresolved. Here, we develop a DGE Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) approach for profiling tumor microenvironments through glucose conversion kinetics. Using a multimodal combination of tumor mouse models, novel strategies for spectroscopic imaging and noise attenuation, and histopathological correlations, we show that tumor lactate turnover mirrors phenotype differences between GL261 and CT2A mouse glioblastoma, whereas recycling of the peritumoral glutamate-glutamine pool is a potential marker of invasion capacity in pooled cohorts, linked to secondary brain lesions. These findings were validated by histopathological characterization of each tumor, including cell density and proliferation, peritumoral invasion and distant migration, and immune cell infiltration. Our study bodes well for precision neuro-oncology, highlighting the importance of mapping glucose flux rates to better understand the metabolic heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its links to disease phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94924">Short-term social isolation acts on hypothalamic neurons to promote social behavior in a sex- and context-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Social animals, including both humans and mice, are highly motivated to engage in social interactions. Short-term social isolation promotes social behavior, but the neural circuits through which it does so remain incompletely understood. Here, we sought to identify neurons that promote social behavior in single-housed female mice, which exhibit increased rates of social investigation, social ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), and mounting during same-sex interactions that follow a period of short-term (3 days) isolation. We first used immunostaining for the immediate early gene Fos to identify a population of neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus (POA) that increase their activity in single-housed females following same-sex interactions (POA<sub>social</sub> neurons) but not in single-housed females that did not engage in social interactions. TRAP2-mediated chemogenetic silencing of POA<sub>social</sub> neurons in single-housed females significantly attenuates the effects of short-term isolation on social investigation, USV production, and mounting. In contrast, caspase-mediated ablation of POA<sub>social</sub> neurons in single-housed females robustly attenuates mounting but does not decrease social investigation or USV production. Optogenetic activation of POA<sub>social</sub> neurons in group-housed females promotes social investigation and USV production but does not recapitulate the effects of short-term isolation on mounting. To understand whether a similar population of POA<sub>social</sub> neurons promotes social behavior in single-housed males, we performed Fos immunostaining in single-housed males following either same-sex or opposite-sex social interactions. These experiments revealed a population of POA neurons that increase Fos expression in single-housed males following opposite-sex, but not same-sex, interactions. Chemogenetic silencing of POA<sub>social</sub> neurons in single-housed males during interactions with females reduces mounting but does not affect social investigation or USV production. These experiments identify a population of hypothalamic neurons that promote social behavior following short-term isolation in a sex- and social context-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101241">Avian-specific Salmonella transition to endemicity is accompanied by localized resistome and mobilome interaction</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial regional demonstration after global dissemination is an essential pathway for selecting distinct finesses. However, the evolution of the resistome during the transition to endemicity remains unaddressed. Using the most comprehensive whole-genome sequencing dataset of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Gallinarum (<i>S</i>. Gallinarum) collected from 15 countries, including 45 newly recovered samples from two related local regions, we established the relationship among avian-specific pathogen genetic profiles and localization patterns. Initially, we revealed the international transmission and evolutionary history of <i>S</i>. Gallinarum to recent endemicity through phylogenetic analysis conducted using a spatiotemporal Bayesian framework. Our findings indicate that the independent acquisition of the resistome via the mobilome, primarily through plasmids and transposons, shapes a unique antimicrobial resistance profile among different lineages. Notably, the mobilome-resistome combination among distinct lineages exhibits a geographical-specific manner, further supporting a localized endemic mobilome-driven process. Collectively, this study elucidates resistome adaptation in the endemic transition of an avian-specific pathogen, likely driven by the localized farming style, and provides valuable insights for targeted interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97271">First evidence for the evolution of host manipulation by tumors during the long-term vertical transmission of tumor cells in Hydra oligactis</a></h4>

              
                While host phenotypic manipulation by parasites is a widespread phenomenon, whether tumors, which can be likened to parasite entities, can also manipulate their hosts is not known. Theory predicts that this should nevertheless be the case, especially when tumors (neoplasms) are transmissible. We explored this hypothesis in a cnidarian <i>Hydra</i> model system, in which spontaneous tumors can occur in the lab, and lineages in which such neoplastic cells are vertically transmitted (through host budding) have been maintained for over 15 years. Remarkably, the hydras with long-term transmissible tumors show an unexpected increase in the number of their tentacles, allowing for the possibility that these neoplastic cells can manipulate the host. By experimentally transplanting healthy as well as neoplastic tissues derived from both recent and long-term transmissible tumors, we found that only the long-term transmissible tumors were able to trigger the growth of additional tentacles. Also, supernumerary tentacles, by permitting higher foraging efficiency for the host, were associated with an increased budding rate, thereby favoring the vertical transmission of tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that, like true parasites, transmissible tumors can evolve strategies to manipulate the phenotype of their host.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97206">ATG6 interacting with NPR1 increases Arabidopsis thaliana resistance to Pst DC3000/avrRps4 by increasing its nuclear accumulation and stability</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy-related gene 6 (ATG6) plays a crucial role in plant immunity. Nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) acts as a signaling hub of plant immunity. However, the relationship between ATG6 and NPR1 is unclear. Here, we find that ATG6 directly interacts with NPR1. <i>ATG6</i> overexpression significantly increased nuclear accumulation of NPR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <i>ATG6</i> increases NPR1 protein levels and improves its stability. Interestingly, ATG6 promotes the formation of SINCs (SA-induced NPR1 condensates)-like condensates. Additionally, ATG6 and NPR1 synergistically promote the expression of <i>pathogenesis-related</i> genes. Further results showed that silencing <i>ATG6</i> in <i>NPR1-GFP</i> exacerbates <i>Pst</i> DC3000/<i>avrRps4</i> infection, while double overexpression of <i>ATG6</i> and <i>NPR1</i> synergistically inhibits <i>Pst</i> DC3000/<i>avrRps4</i> infection. In summary, our findings unveil an interplay of NPR1 with ATG6 and elucidate important molecular mechanisms for enhancing plant immunity.

">When non-canonical olfaction is optimal</a></h4>

              
                The early olfactory system is canonically described by a "one-receptor-to-one-neuron" model: each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single type of olfactory receptor. Although the olfactory systems of classic model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, many exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes co-express multiple types of olfactory receptors in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and non-canonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Non-canonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor co-expression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.

">Neutrophil stalling does not mediate the increase in tau phosphorylation and the cognitive impairment associated with high salt diet</a></h4>

              
                High dietary salt intake has powerful effects on cerebral blood vessels and has emerged as a risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment. In mice, high salt diet (HSD) leads to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive dysfunction. However, it is still unclear whether the reduced CBF is responsible for the effects of HSD on tau and cognition. Capillary stalling has emerged as a cause of CBF reduction and cognitive impairment in models of Alzheimer disease and diabetes. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that capillary stalling also contributes to the CBF reduction and cognitive impairment in HSD. Using two-photon imaging, we found that HSD increased stalling of neutrophils in brain capillaries and decreased CBF. Neutrophil depletion reduced the number of stalled capillaries and restored resting CBF but did not prevent tau phosphorylation or cognitive impairment. These novel findings show that, capillary stalling contribute to CBF reduction in HSD, but not to tau phosphorylation and cognitive deficits. Therefore, the hypoperfusion caused by capillary stalling is not the main driver of the tau phosphorylation and cognitive impairment.

">Oxygen/glucose-deprivation causes long-term impairment of synaptic CaMKII movement</a></h4>

              
                Learning and memory are thought to require hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity that is persistently impaired after cerebral ischemia and that requires movement of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to excitatory synapses. We show here that oxygen/glucose-deprivation (OGD) in cultures hippocampal neurons causes a long-lasting impairment of CaMKII movement. Notably, CaMKII inhibition at 30 min after onset of OGD prevented the impairment in CaMKII movement. Thus, CaMKII mediates both, LTP mechanisms and their ischemia-induced impairment. These findings provide a mechanism by which ischemic conditions can impair LTP and explain how CaMKII inhibition after cerebral ischemia can prevent these LTP impairments.

">Molecular and cellular signatures differentiate Parkinson's disease from Parkinson's disease with dementia</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions of people worldwide, and up to 40% of these patients develop dementia, profoundly affecting their quality of life. Whether Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) simply represents a late stage of PD or constitutes a distinct neurodegenerative process remains unresolved. To clarify this, we generated the largest single nuclear transcriptomic atlas of PD and PDD to date - almost one million nuclei derived from the anterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule of 64 post-mortem donors. By integrating these data with long-read RNA-seq, we found that the cellular compositions, biological pathways, and molecular profiles diverge substantially between PD and PDD, with minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes and pathways. While PD was characterised by widespread upregulation of gene expression programs and robust regional signatures, PDD showed extensive pathway downregulation, loss of cortical regional identity, and significant shifts in transcript usage, including alterations in APP isoforms that may influence pathological amyloid beta accumulation. These findings reveal that PD and PDD represent fundamentally distinct disease states, offering important insights for understanding their underlying mechanisms and will guide the development of targeted therapies and more effective clinical trials.

">Decoding neuronal wiring by joint inference of cell identity and synaptic connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Animal behaviors are executed by motor neurons (MNs), which receive information from complex pre-motor neuron (preMN) circuits and output commands to muscles. How motor circuits are established during development remains an important unsolved problem in neuroscience. Here we focus on the development of the motor circuits that control the movements of the adult legs in Drosophila melanogaster. After generating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets for leg MNs at multiple time points, we describe the time course of gene expression for multiple gene families. This analysis reveals that transcription factors (TFs) and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) appear to drive the molecular diversity between individual MNs. In parallel, we introduce ConnectionMiner, a novel computational tool that integrates scRNAseq data with electron microscopy-derived connectomes. ConnectionMiner probabilistically refines ambiguous cell type annotations by leveraging neural wiring patterns, and, in turn, it identifies combinatorial gene expression signatures that correlate with synaptic connectivity strength. Applied to the Drosophila leg motor system, ConnectionMiner yields a comprehensive transcriptional annotation of both MNs and preMNs and uncovers candidate effector gene combinations that likely orchestrate the assembly of neural circuits from preMNs to MNs and ultimately to muscles.

">Multimodal optical imaging and modulation through Smart Dura in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                A multimodal neural interface integrating electrical and optical functionalities is a promising tool for recording and manipulating neuronal activity, providing multiscale information with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. However, most technologies for multimodal implementation are limited in their applications to small animal models and lack the ability to translate to larger brains, such as non-human primates (NHPs). Recently, we have developed a large-scale neural interface for NHPs, Smart Dura, which enables electrophysiological recordings and high optical accessibility. In this paper, we demonstrate the multimodal applications of Smart Dura in NHPs by combining with multiphoton imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI), as well as optical manipulations such as photothrombotic lesioning and optogenetics. Through the transparent Smart Dura, we could obtain fluorescence images down to 200 m and 550 m depth using two-photon and three-photon microscopy, respectively. Integrated with simultaneous electrophysiology using the Smart Dura, we could also assess vascular and neural dynamics with OCTA and ISOI, induce ischemic stroke, and apply optogenetic neuromodulation over a wide coverage area of 20 mm diameter. This multimodal interface enables comprehensive investigations of brain dynamics in NHPs, advancing translational neurotechnology for human applications.

">Distinct Connectivity Signatures of Emotions Enhance Precision of Network Biomarkers in Mood Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Mood disorders, including Major Depressive (MDD) and Bipolar (BD) Disorder, are highly prevalent and debilitating conditions that contribute significantly to the global disease burden. These disorders are characterized by persistent emotional dysregulations, such as pervasive sadness and anhedonia, resulting in substantial functional impairments. Although neuroimaging studies have identified differences in brain activity and connectivity between individuals with MDD (MDDs) or BD (BDs) and healthy controls (HCs), reliable and reproducible neurofunctional markers for clinical diagnosis and treatment remain elusive. This study seeks to address this gap by introducing a novel approach that utilizes Divergent Emotional Functional Networks (DEFN), derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during dynamic emotional processing in naturalistic contexts. Using a combination of naturalistic induction of sustained emotional experience with dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and machine learning techniques, we decoded emotion-specific patterns of happiness and sadness in healthy individuals. Based on the dynamic functional connectivity signatures, we identify the DEFN and applied it to large clinical mood disorder datasets, including MDD (n=63) and BD patients (n=61). The model with DEFN demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to conventional baseline models, achieving up to 10.75% and 9.92% performance increases in MDD and BD datasets, respectively. Additionally, DEFN were found to be highly reproducible across age, gender and models from emotion dataset, supporting the robustness of this model in distinguishing mood disorders from healthy controls. In conclusion, the DEFN approach presents a promising, reproducible, and clinically relevant neural marker for diagnosing and understanding emotional dysfunction in mood disorders, offering potential for more effective and timely interventions.

">Laminar Architecture of a Decision Circuit in Orbitofrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                During economic choice, different neurons in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode individual offer values, the binary choice outcome, and the chosen value. Previous work suggests that these cell groups form a decision circuit, but the anatomical organization of this circuit is poorly understood. Using calcium imaging, we recorded from layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5) of mice choosing between juice flavors. Decision variables were differentially represented across layers: juice-specific offer values and their spatial configuration were predominant in L2/3, while spatial offer values, chosen side, and chosen value were predominant in L5. Within each layer, functional cell groups were organized in clusters. The temporal dynamics of neural signals in the two layers indicated a combination of feed-forward and feed-back processes, and pointed to L5 as the locus for winner-take-all value comparison. These results reveal that economic decisions rely on a complex architecture distributed across layers of OFC.

">Novel function of Contactin associated protein 1 (Caspr 1)/ Paranodin in embryonic cortical neurons: hypoxia modulated neurite development.</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia, a condition of inadequate oxygen supply, is a common phenomenon affecting neurons and brain tissue, leading to significant implications for neuronal health and function. The prevalence of hypoxia in the brain is associated with various neurological conditions, making it a critical area of study. Neuritogenesis, the process of neurite outgrowth, is an essential aspect of neuronal development and connectivity and is particularly sensitive to hypoxic stress. Investigating how hypoxia affects neurite outgrowth is vital for understanding neuronal response and adaptation under low oxygen conditions. This study explores how hypoxic stress affects neurite regulation mediated by Contactin Associated Protein-1 (Caspr1) in primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons. Hypoxia, induced by culturing neurons in a 2% oxygen environment, significantly reduced neurite length and induced notable changes in growth cone morphology. Concurrently, we observed an upregulation in the expression of Caspr1 and its transcriptional regulator C/EBP, suggesting a compensatory role for Caspr1 in neurite extension under low oxygen conditions. Shorter hypoxia exposure periods revealed a dynamic biphasic response in Caspr1 levels, with an initial decrease followed by a substantial increase, correlating with corresponding changes in neurite length. This pattern emphasizes the critical involvement of Caspr1 in adapting neurite growth to fluctuating hypoxia duration. Furthermore, comparative analyses using wild-type and Caspr1 knockout Neuro2a cells demonstrated that the absence of Caspr1 mitigates hypoxia-induced neurite shortening, indicating a potential protective role against hypoxic stress. Additionally, hypoxia profoundly impacted mitochondrial morphology and function. Under hypoxic conditions, mitochondria transitioned to a more spherical shape. Mitochondrial respiration analysis revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), highlighting compromised mitochondrial function during hypoxia. These findings underscore the multifaceted role of Caspr1 in neurite regulation and mitochondrial adaptation to hypoxic stress. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning hypoxia-induced changes in neuronal morphology and function. Understanding these processes opens avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting Caspr1 in treating neurological disorders characterized by hypoxic stress. Future research will benefit from extending these investigations to more complex models, such as brain organoids, to further elucidate the metabolic and structural changes under hypoxia and their implications for neurodegenerative diseases.

">Oxytocin and Dopamine Receptor Expression: Cellular Level Implications for Pair Bonding</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin (Oxtr) and dopamine (Drd1, Drd2) receptors provide a canonical example for how differences in neuromodulatory receptors drive individual and species-level behavioral variation. These systems exhibit striking and functionally-relevant differences in nucleus accumbens (NAc) expression across monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and promiscuous meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). However, their cellular organization remains largely unknown. Using multiplex in situ hybridization, we mapped Oxtr, Drd1, and Drd2 expression in sexually naive and mate-paired prairie and meadow voles. Prairie voles have more Oxtr+ cells than meadow voles, but Oxtr distribution across dopamine-receptor cell class was similar, indicating a general upregulation rather than cell class bias. Oxtr was enriched in cells that express both dopamine receptors (Drd1+/Drd2+) in prairie voles, suggesting these cells may be particularly sensitive to oxytocin. We found no species or pairing-induced differences in Drd1+ or Drd2+ cell counts, suggesting prior reports of expression differences may reflect upregulation in cells already expressing these receptors. Finally, we used single-nucleus sequencing to provide the first comprehensive map of Oxtr and Drd1-5 across molecularly-defined NAc cell types in the prairie vole. These results provide a critical framework for understanding how nonapeptide and catecholamine systems may recruit distinct NAc cell types to shape social behavior.

">Neural representation of action symbols in primate frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                At the core of intelligence is proficiency in solving new problems, including those that differ dramatically from problems seen before. Problem-solving, in turn, depends on goal-directed generation of novel thoughts and behaviors, which has been proposed to rely on internal representations of discrete units, or symbols, and processes that can recombine them into a large set of possible composite representations. Although this view has been influential in formulating cognitive-level explanations of behavior, definitive evidence for a neuronal substrate of symbols has remained elusive. Here, we identify a neural population encoding action symbols--internal, recombinable representations of discrete units of motor behavior--localized to a specific area of frontal cortex. In macaque monkeys performing a drawing-like task designed to assess recombination of learned action symbols into novel sequences, we found behavioral evidence for three critical features that indicate actions have an underlying symbolic representation: (i) invariance over low-level motor parameters; (ii) categorical structure, reflecting discrete classes of action; and (iii) recombination into novel sequences. In simultaneous neural recordings across motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex, we found that planning-related population activity in ventral premotor cortex encodes actions in a manner that, like behavior, reflects motor invariance, categorical structure, and recombination, three properties indicating a symbolic representation. Activity in no other recorded area exhibited this combination of properties. These findings reveal a neural representation of action symbols localized to PMv, and therefore identify a putative neural substrate for symbolic cognitive operations.

">Differential glutamatergic and GABAergic responses drive divergent prefrontal cortex neural outcomes to low and high frequency stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive brain stimulation is hypothesized to bidirectionally modulate excitability, with low-frequency trains decreasing and high-frequency (>5 Hz) trains increasing activity. Most insights on the neuroplastic effects of repetitive stimulation protocols stem from non-invasive human studies (TMS/EEG) or data from rodent slice physiology. Here, we developed a rodent experimental preparation enabling simultaneous imaging of cellular activity during stimulation in vivo to understand the mechanisms by which brain stimulation modulates the excitability of the prefrontal cortex. Methods: Repetitive trains of intracortical stimulation were applied to the medial prefrontal cortex using current parameters mapped to human rTMS electric-field estimates. Calcium imaging of glutamatergic (CamKII) and GABAergic (mDLX) neurons was performed before, during, and after stimulation in awake rodents (n=9 females). Protocols included low-frequency (1 Hz, 1000 pulses) and high-frequency (10 Hz, 3000 pulses), with sham stimulation as a control. Results: Glutamatergic neurons were differentially modulated by stimulation frequency, with 10 Hz increasing and 1 Hz decreasing activity. Post-stimulation, 1 Hz suppressed both glutamatergic and GABAergic activity, whereas 10 Hz selectively suppressed GABAergic neurons. Conclusions: These findings provide direct evidence that clinical brain stimulation protocols induce long-term modulation of cortical excitability, with low-frequency stimulation broadly suppressing activity and high-frequency stimulation preferentially inhibiting GABAergic neurons after stimulation.

                <p>While ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is effective in treating major depression, studies have not addressed the safety of repeated ketamine infusions in depressed patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this study, we aimed to determine whether a history of chronic social isolation and alcohol exposure alter the reinforcing properties of ketamine in male and female rats. Rats were pair-housed or socially isolated for 12&nbsp;weeks and underwent intermittent access to 20% alcohol. Subsequently, rats underwent intravenous ketamine self-administration under a fixed ratio 1 schedule, followed by extinction training and one session of cue-induced reinstatement. Dendritic spine morphology was examined in the nucleus accumbens, an important area implicated in reward and motivation. Our results show that females self-administered more ketamine than males, a history of alcohol increased ketamine intake in females, and a history of isolation or alcohol independently increased ketamine intake in males. All experimental groups showed similar extinction patterns and reinstatement to ketamine cues. A pattern emerged similar to ketamine self-administration behaviors, where isolation increased the number of immature spines in males, a change that was attenuated in isolated alcohol drinkers, and a history of alcohol increased the number of immature spines in females. Our results suggest that a history of isolation and alcohol modulate the reinforcing properties of ketamine in a sex-dependent manner. This underscores the importance of considering sex differences and a history of alcohol use when employing ketamine to treat various psychopathologies, including major depression.</p>

                <p>In models of visual spatial attention control, it is commonly held that top&ndash;down control signals originate in the dorsal attention network, propagating to the visual cortex to modulate baseline neural activity and bias sensory processing. However, the precise distribution of these top&ndash;down influences across different levels of the visual hierarchy is debated. In addition, it is unclear whether these baseline neural activity changes translate into improved performance. We analyzed attention-related baseline activity during the anticipatory period of a voluntary spatial attention task, using two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and two analytic approaches. First, as in prior studies, univariate analysis showed that covert attention significantly enhanced baseline neural activity in higher-order visual areas contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, while effects in lower-order visual areas (e.g., V1) were weaker and more variable. Second, in contrast, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed significant decoding of attention conditions across all visual cortical areas, with lower-order visual areas exhibiting higher decoding accuracies than higher-order areas. Third, decoding accuracy, rather than the magnitude of univariate activation, was a better predictor of a subject's stimulus discrimination performance. Finally, the MVPA results were replicated across two experimental conditions, where the direction of spatial attention was either externally instructed by a cue or based on the participants&rsquo; free choice decision about where to attend. Together, these findings offer new insights into the extent of attentional biases in the visual hierarchy under top&ndash;down control and how these biases influence both sensory processing and behavioral performance.</p>

                Background Prolonged disability resulting from road traffic injuries (RTIs) contributes significantly to morbidity and disease burden. A good understanding of the prevalence and the level of disability of orthopedic injuries in developing countries is crucial for improvement; however, such data are currently lacking in Rwanda. Policy and implications The goal of the policy is to address the growing number of road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Rwanda, with a focus on orthopaedic injuries that result in permanent disabilities. It suggests enhancing data collection and research, bolstering emergency response systems, growing rehabilitation services, offering victims social and financial support, and promoting inclusive policies. These programs may result in better emergency care, better rehabilitation outcomes, more informed interventions, lighter loads for victims and their families, more community support and awareness, and eventually a safer and more welcoming society for all Rwandans impacted by RTIs. Recommendations Rwanda’s road traffic injuries (RTIs) are on the rise, and addressing this requires strengthening emergency response systems, expanding rehabilitation services, improving data collection, providing financial and social support, and advocating for inclusive policies. These measures aim to improve care, rehabilitation access, and foster a safer environment, reducing RTI burdens. Conclusions The conclusion underscores the urgent need for comprehensive action to tackle the high prevalence of road traffic orthopaedic injuries in Rwanda, emphasizing the need for enhanced emergency response, expanded rehabilitation services, and inclusive policies.

                As is already known, the Japanese Civil Code (JCC), enacted in 1896, was formulated with reference to the discipline of many foreign laws, including the French Civil Code (FCC) and the draft of the German Civil Code (BGB) at the time. Among the objects of discipline stipulated in the JCC, the concept of German law was widely adopted for the provisions on set-off. However, in the interpretation of these provisions, the Japanese Supreme Court sometimes adopted views that differed from the provisions of BGB and its interpretation. This case law was clarified when the Law of Obligations of the JCC was revised in 2017. This paper explains the various set-off requirements stipulated by Japanese current law. In Japan, the conditions under which the statutory requirements for set-off are satisfied are described as “eligibility for set-off” (Sousai-Tekijou), and the legal status of the parties in the set-off is called the right to set-off. Even if this eligibility for set-off arises, the parties may not exercise the right to set-off if there are circumstances that restrict the set-off. In addition, the Japanese Bankruptcy Act (JBA) modifies the requirements provided by the JCC to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings. In this paper, we will review in order the affirmative requirements for creating eligibility for set-off, the negative requirements for restricting the exercise of the right to set-off, and the requirements for set-off in bankruptcy proceedings. Please note that under Japanese law, when A intends to extinguish B’s claim β against him by set-off against his claim α, A’s claim α is referred to as an active claim (Jido-Saiken, Aktivforderung), and B’s cross-claim β as a passive claim (Judo-Saiken, Passivforderung). This paper will also be described based on this terminology 1 .

                Purpose The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate differences in pathological outcomes and safety between subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer management. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect for original articles published until February 2024 that compared tumour characteristics, biochemical markers, and adverse effects associated with these treatments. The risk of bias from each study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Risk of Bias-2 (ROB-2) tool. Results Thirteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed. Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT effectively reduced tumour size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Subcapsular orchiectomy was linked to higher surgical complication rates. At the same time, due to its systemic pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacological ADT carries a greater risk of metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and insulin resistance. Conclusions Both subcapsular orchiectomy and pharmacological ADT are viable options for prostate cancer treatment. However, their differing safety and pharmacological profiles highlight the need for personalised treatment strategies based on individual patient factors and preferences.

                Background The 2013-2016 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak resulted in 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths officially reported to the World Health Organization. Previous studies investigating factors associated with death had conflicting findings, interventions showing promising outcomes had small sample sizes, studies were often single- or dual-country based and most focused on laboratory-confirmed EVD and not on clinically-suspected EVD. We used the Ebola data platform of the Infectious Disease Data Observatory (IDDO) to review individual patient records to assess factors associated with death, and particularly whether there were differences between laboratory-confirmed and clinically-suspected cases. Methods This was a cohort study involving analysis of secondary data in the IDDO database. The study population included all patients classified as having either clinically-suspected or laboratory-confirmed EVD, admitted to 22 Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between December 2013 and March 2016. Baseline characteristics and treatments were documented along with ETU exit outcomes. Factors associated with death were investigated by multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results There were 14,163 patients, of whom 6,208 (43.8%) were laboratory-confirmed and 7,955 (56.2%) were clinically-suspected. Outcomes were not recorded in 2,889 (20.4%) patients. Of the 11,274 patients with known outcomes, 4,090 (36.3%) died: 2,956 (43.6%) with laboratory-confirmed EVD and 1,134 (18.8%) with clinically-suspected EVD. The strongest risk factor for death was confirmed disease status. Patients with laboratory-confirmed disease had 2.9 times higher risk of death compared to clinically-suspected patients, after adjusting for other co-variables. Other factors significantly associated with death included a higher risk for patients aged ≥60 years and a lower risk for patients in Sierra Leone. Conclusions Although laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to ETUs fared worse than clinically-suspected patients, the latter still had a substantial risk of death and more attention needs to be paid to this group in future EVD outbreaks.

                <p>by André Victor Ribeiro Amaral, Daniel Wolffram, Paula Moraga, Johannes Bracher</p>

In infectious disease surveillance, incidence data are frequently subject to reporting delays and retrospective corrections, making it hard to assess current trends in real time. A variety of probabilistic nowcasting methods have been suggested to correct for the resulting biases. Building upon a recent comparison of eight of these methods in an application to COVID-19 hospitalization data from Germany, the objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate how nowcasts from different models can be improved using statistical post-processing methods as employed, e.g., in weather forecasting. Secondly, we assess the potential of weighted ensemble nowcasts, i.e., weighted combinations of different probabilistic nowcasts. These are a natural extension of unweighted nowcast ensembles, which have previously been found to outperform most individual models. Both in post-processing and ensemble building, specific challenges arise from the fact that data are constantly revised, hindering the use of standard approaches. We find that post-processing can improve the individual performance of almost all considered models both in terms of evaluation scores and forecast interval coverage. Improving upon the performance of unweighted ensemble nowcasts via weighting schemes, on the other hand, poses a substantial challenge. Across an array of approaches, we find modest improvement in scores for some and decreased performance for most, with overall more favorable results for simple methods. In terms of forecast interval coverage, however, our methods lead to rather consistent improvements over the unweighted ensembles.

                <p>by Nachshon Korem, Or Duek, Ruonan Jia, Emily Wertheimer, Sierra Metviner, Michael Grubb, Ifat Levy</p>

Modeling decision-making under uncertainty typically relies on quantitative outcomes. Many decisions, however, are qualitative in nature, posing problems for traditional models. Here, we aimed to model uncertainty attitudes in decisions with qualitative outcomes. Participants made choices between certain outcomes and the chance for more favorable outcomes in quantitative (monetary) and qualitative (medical) modalities. Using computational modeling, we estimated the values participants assigned to qualitative outcomes and compared uncertainty attitudes across domains. Our model provided a good fit for the data, including quantitative estimates for qualitative outcomes. The model outperformed a utility function in quantitative decisions. Additionally, we found an association between ambiguity attitudes across domains. Results were replicated in an independent sample. We demonstrate the ability to extract quantitative measures from qualitative outcomes, leading to better estimation of subjective values. This allows for the characterization of individual behavior traits under a wide range of conditions.

                <p>by Rafael E. Venado, Jennifer Wilker, Vânia C. S. Pankievicz, Valentina Infante, April MacIntyre, Emily S. A. Wolf, Saddie Vela, Fletcher Robbins, Paulo Ivan Fernandes-Júnior, Wilfred Vermerris, Jean-Michel Ané</p>

Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) is an important food, feed, and fodder crop worldwide and is gaining popularity as an energy crop due to its high potential for biomass production. Some sorghum accessions develop many aerial roots and produce an abundant carbohydrate-rich mucilage after rain. This aerial root mucilage is similar to that observed in landraces of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) from southern Mexico, which have been previously shown to host diazotrophs. In this study, we characterized the aerial root development of several sorghum accessions and the impact of humidity on this trait. We conducted a microbiome study of the aerial root mucilage of maize and sorghum and isolated numerous diazotrophs from field sorghum mucilage. We observed that the prevailing phyla in the mucilage were Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota. However, bacterial abundances varied based on the genotype and the location. Using acetylene reduction, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> gas feeding, and <sup>15</sup>N isotope dilution assays, we confirmed that these sorghum accessions can acquire about 40% of their nitrogen from the atmosphere through these associations on aerial roots. Nitrogen fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage offers a promising avenue to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers and promote sustainable agricultural practices for food, feed, fodder, and bioenergy production.

                <p>by Nicholas C. Morano, Davys H. Lopez, Hagar Meltzer, Alina P. Sergeeva, Phinikoula S. Katsamba, Kevin D. Rostam, Himanshu Pawankumar Gupta, Jordan E. Becker, Bavat Bornstein, Filip Cosmanescu, Oren Schuldiner, Barry Honig, Richard S. Mann, Lawrence Shapiro</p>

In <i>Drosophila</i>, two interacting adhesion protein families, Defective proboscis responses (Dprs) and Dpr interacting proteins (DIPs), coordinate the assembly of neural networks. While intercellular DIP::Dpr interactions have been well characterized, DIPs and Dprs are often co-expressed within the same cells, raising the question as to whether they also interact in <i>cis</i>. We show, in cultured cells and in vivo, that DIP-α and DIP-δ can interact in <i>cis</i> with their ligands, Dpr6/10 and Dpr12, respectively. When co-expressed in <i>cis</i> with their cognate partners, these Dprs regulate the extent of <i>trans</i> binding, presumably through competitive <i>cis</i> interactions. We demonstrate the neurodevelopmental effects of <i>cis</i> inhibition in fly motor neurons and in the mushroom body. We further show that a long disordered region of DIP-α at the C-terminus is required for <i>cis</i> but not <i>trans</i> interactions, likely because it alleviates geometric constraints on <i>cis</i> binding. Thus, the balance between <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions plays a role in controlling neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-252/v1?src=rss">Optimizing treatment of lepromatous form of leprosy using ofloxacin on top of standard multi-drug therapy in National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Standard multi-drug therapy (MDT) with duration of 6-12 months is generally effective for treating leprosy. However, in cases of lepromatous (LL) and borderline lepromatous (BL) patients with high bacterial loads and complicated circumtances, prolonged duration treatment is more often observed. As prolonged duration may affect patient adherence negatively, adding ofloxacin to MDT is a promising approach to prevent prolonged treatment. Method This retrospective cohort study investigated the effects of adding ofloxacin to MDT in 21 patients diagnosed with LL or BL leprosy at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial load and viability were tracked using the Bacteriological Index (BI) and Morphological Index (MI), and were compared using non-parametric Friedman test before and after the patients were given ofloxacin. Findings Adding ofloxacin to MDT led to a significant reductions in both BI and MI. The median MI dropped to zero after six months of combined treatment (p<0.001), with significant differences between baseline and 6, 9, and 12-months. BI also significantly declined (p=0.007), with significant reductions between baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12-month assessments. The proportion of patients reaching an MI of zero also steadily increased. Interpretation Ofloxacin as an adjunctive therapy to MDT substantially improves treatment of leprosy with high bacterial and morphological index. Faster bacterial clearance prevent prolonged treatment duration, potentially improving adherence, outcomes and reducing relapse risk. Ofloxacin is the only second-line leprosy treatment covered by the national health insurance in Indonesia. Earlier initiation of this adjunctive therapy may offer greater benefits.

                This paper explores the diverse forms of digital democracy in the West and Asia from a human perspective. In particular, it analyzes the differences in the approaches to data governance in the US and the EU, the different strategies for democratization in the Middle East, and the rise of digital authoritarianism in China. Furthermore, it proposes an Asian approach to cyber governance based on Confucian thought, and advocates the creation of a collaborative global digital order with diverse stakeholders that emphasizes a balance between individual rights and the well-being of the community. Next, the paper highlights the rise of digital authoritarianism, particularly in China’s “Great Firewall” system and its export of surveillance technology to developing countries. This trend underscores fears that centralized AI and big-data analytics could enable “digital dictatorships,” manipulating citizens’ information flows and curtailing liberties. Meanwhile, Western democracies themselves grapple with election interference through social media. Drawing on Confucian thought and the Kyoto School, the author proposes that an Asian approach to cyber governance could balance individual rights and communal well-being. Instead of imposing Western models, careful, incremental integration of democratic ideals—such as personal “right of certification”—into digital frameworks might avoid the pitfalls that plagued abrupt Middle East interventions. The paper concludes by urging a pluralistic, multi-stakeholder approach to setting fair cyber norms and privacy standards, aiming to foster a more stable, inclusive global digital order.

<p>Dystonia research focuses on the identification of converging biological pathways, allowing to define molecular drivers that serve as treatment targets. We summarize evidence supporting the concept that aberrations in purine metabolism intersect with dystonia pathogenesis. The recent discovery of <i>IMPDH2</i>-related dystonia introduced a gain-of-function paradigm in purinergic system defects, offering new perspectives to understand purine-pool imbalances in brain diseases. We discuss commonalities between known dystonia-linked mechanisms and mechanisms emerging from studies of purine metabolism disorders including Lesch–Nyhan disease. Together, we hypothesize that a greater appreciation of the relevance of purine perturbances in dystonia can offer fresh avenues for therapeutic intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99593">Emergence of alternative stable states in microbial communities undergoing horizontal gene transfer</a></h4>

              
                Microbial communities living in the same environment often display alternative stable states, each characterized by a unique composition of species. Understanding the origin and determinants of microbiome multistability has broad implications in environments, human health, and microbiome engineering. However, despite its conceptual importance, how multistability emerges in complex communities remains largely unknown. Here, we focused on the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), one important aspect mostly overlooked in previous studies, on the stability landscape of microbial populations. Combining mathematical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, when mobile genetic elements (MGEs) only affect bacterial growth rates, increasing HGT rate in general promotes multistability of complex microbiota. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where HGT changes interspecies interactions, microbial communities are subjected to strong environmental selections and microbes live in metacommunities consisting of multiple local habitats. We also discuss the role of different mechanisms, including interspecies interaction strength, the growth rate effects of MGEs, MGE epistasis and microbial death rates in shaping the multistability of microbial communities undergoing HGT. These results reveal how different dynamic processes collectively shape community multistability and diversity. Our results provide key insights for the predictive control and engineering of complex microbiota.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100284">Electrostatics of salt-dependent reentrant phase behaviors highlights diverse roles of ATP in biomolecular condensates</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) involving intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) is a major physical mechanism for biological membraneless compartmentalization. The multifaceted electrostatic effects in these biomolecular condensates are exemplified here by experimental and theoretical investigations of the different salt- and ATP-dependent LLPSs of an IDR of messenger RNA-regulating protein Caprin1 and its phosphorylated variant pY-Caprin1, exhibiting, for example, reentrant behaviors in some instances but not others. Experimental data are rationalized by physical modeling using analytical theory, molecular dynamics, and polymer field-theoretic simulations, indicating that interchain ion bridges enhance LLPS of polyelectrolytes such as Caprin1 and the high valency of ATP-magnesium is a significant factor for its colocalization with the condensed phases, as similar trends are observed for other IDRs. The electrostatic nature of these features complements ATP’s involvement in π-related interactions and as an amphiphilic hydrotrope, underscoring a general role of biomolecular condensates in modulating ion concentrations and its functional ramifications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97234">The Kv2.2 channel mediates the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells</a></h4>

              
                Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an endogenous inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism by which PGE2 inhibits GSIS. Our results showed that PGE2 inhibited Kv2.2 channels via increasing PKA activity in HEK293T cells overexpressed with Kv2.2 channels. Point mutation analysis demonstrated that S448 residue was responsible for the PKA-dependent modulation of Kv2.2. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on Kv2.2 was blocked by EP2/4 receptor antagonists, while mimicked by EP2/4 receptor agonists. The immune fluorescence results showed that EP1–4 receptors are expressed in both mouse and human β-cells. In INS-1(832/13) β-cells, PGE2 inhibited voltage-gated potassium currents and electrical activity through EP2/4 receptors and Kv2.2 channels. Knockdown of <i>Kcnb2</i> reduced the action potential firing frequency and alleviated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in INS-1(832/13) β-cells. PGE2 impaired glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but did not alter glucose tolerance in <i>Kcnb2</i> knockout mice. Knockout of <i>Kcnb2</i> reduced electrical activity, GSIS and abrogated the inhibition of PGE2 on GSIS in mouse islets. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits GSIS in pancreatic β-cells through the EP2/4-Kv2.2 signaling pathway. The findings highlight the significant role of Kv2.2 channels in the regulation of β-cell repetitive firing and insulin secretion, and contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes.

                The neural noise hypothesis of dyslexia posits an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) brain activity as an underlying mechanism of reading difficulties. This study provides the first direct test of this hypothesis using both electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum measures in 120 Polish adolescents and young adults (60 with dyslexia, 60 controls) and glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7T MRI scanner in half of the sample. Our results, supported by Bayesian statistics, show no evidence of E/I balance differences between groups, challenging the hypothesis that cortical hyperexcitability underlies dyslexia. These findings suggest that alternative mechanisms must be explored and highlight the need for further research into the E/I balance and its role in neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102782">Ethograms predict visual fear conditioning status in rats</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing and responding to threat cues is essential to survival. Freezing is a predominant threat behavior in rats. We have recently shown that a threat cue can organize diverse behaviors beyond freezing, including locomotion (Chu et al., 2024). However, that experimental design was complex, required many sessions, and had rats receive many foot shock presentations. Moreover, the findings were descriptive. Here, we gave female and male Long Evans rats cue light illumination paired or unpaired with foot shock (8 total) in a conditioned suppression setting, using a range of shock intensities (0.15, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.50 mA). We found that conditioned suppression was only observed at higher foot shock intensities (0.35 mA and 0.50 mA). We constructed comprehensive temporal ethograms by scoring 22,272 frames across 12 behavior categories in 200-ms intervals around cue light illumination. The 0.50 mA and 0.35 mA shock-paired visual cues suppressed reward seeking, rearing, and scaling, as well as light-directed rearing and light-directed scaling. The shock-paired visual cue further elicited locomotion and freezing. Linear discriminant analyses showed that ethogram data could accurately classify rats into paired and unpaired groups. Using complete ethogram data produced superior classification compared to behavior subsets, including an Immobility subset featuring freezing. The results demonstrate diverse threat behaviors – in a short and simple procedure – containing sufficient information to distinguish the visual fear conditioning status of individual rats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102002">A conformational fingerprint for amyloidogenic light chains</a></h4>

              
                Both immunoglobulin light-chain (LC) amyloidosis (AL) and multiple myeloma (MM) share the overproduction of a clonal LC. However, while LCs in MM remain soluble in circulation, AL LCs misfold into toxic-soluble species and amyloid fibrils that accumulate in organs, leading to distinct clinical manifestations. The significant sequence variability of LCs has hindered the understanding of the mechanisms driving LC aggregation. Nevertheless, emerging biochemical properties, including dimer stability, conformational dynamics, and proteolysis susceptibility, distinguish AL LCs from those in MM under native conditions. This study aimed to identify a<sup>2</sup> conformational fingerprint distinguishing AL from MM LCs. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) under native conditions, we analyzed four AL and two MM LCs. We observed that AL LCs exhibited a slightly larger radius of gyration and greater deviations from X-ray crystallography-determined or predicted structures, reflecting enhanced conformational dynamics. SAXS data, integrated with molecular dynamics simulations, revealed a conformational ensemble where LCs adopt multiple states, with variable and constant domains either bent or straight. AL LCs displayed a distinct, low-populated, straight conformation (termed H state), which maximized solvent accessibility at the interface between constant and variable domains. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experimentally validated this H state. These findings reconcile diverse experimental observations and provide a precise structural target for future drug design efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88849">SIV-specific neutralizing antibody induction following selection of a PI3K drive-attenuated nef variant</a></h4>

              
                HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are known for impaired neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. While sequential virus–host B cell interaction appears to be basally required for NAb induction, driver molecular signatures predisposing to NAb induction still remain largely unknown. Here we describe SIV-specific NAb induction following a virus–host interplay decreasing aberrant viral drive of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Screening of seventy difficult-to-neutralize SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-infected macaques found nine NAb-inducing animals, with seven selecting for a specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell escape mutation in viral <i>nef</i> before NAb induction. This Nef-G63E mutation reduced excess Nef interaction-mediated drive of B-cell maturation-limiting PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). In vivo imaging cytometry depicted preferential Nef perturbation of cognate Envelope-specific B cells, suggestive of polarized contact-dependent Nef transfer and corroborating cognate B-cell maturation post-mutant selection up to NAb induction. Results collectively exemplify a NAb induction pattern extrinsically reciprocal to human PI3K gain-of-function antibody-dysregulating disease and indicate that harnessing the PI3K/mTORC2 axis may facilitate NAb induction against difficult-to-neutralize viruses including HIV/SIV.

                The Cre-loxP system is a powerful tool for spatial and temporal genetic manipulations. However, the system is prone to several limitations and caveats with respect to variable expression and recombination in unintended cell types. Using one of the most widely used astrocyte Cre lines, hGFAP-creERT2 (GFAP-cre/ERT2)505Fmv/J), we found that parental origin of the hGFAP-creERT2 transgene is a determinant of recombination efficiency. Recombination was robust in animals with paternally inherited hGFAP-creERT2. However, animals with maternally inherited Cre exhibited little to no recombination. This result was recapitulated using female hGFAP-creERT2 mice procured directly from Jackson Laboratory. We did not observe transgenerational suppression of Cre recombination in maternally inherited hGFAP-CreERT2. These data highlight the need for careful planning and documentation of breeding schemes when working with Cre mice.

">Increased Callosal Thickness in Early Trained Opera Singers</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research has shown how the corpus callosum adapts to early sensorimotor training in instrumental musicians, yet less is known about these effects in professional singers. This study used high-resolution MRI to investigate variations in callosal thickness in relation to vocal training in 55 participants, including 27 professionally trained opera singers and 28 non-singers. Results indicated trend-level differences with thicker callosal regions in singers, particularly at the anterior-posterior midbody border and the isthmus, though these did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons. However, a significant negative correlation between age at first singing lesson and callosal thickness was found in the anterior third (rostrum, genu, rostral body), the anterior-posterior midbody border, and the isthmus, suggesting that early vocal training facilitates lasting neuroplastic adaptations in these regions. Additionally, a positive trend between years of professional singing and greater thickness in the midbody was observed but did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Greater callosal thickness likely enhances interhemispheric connectivity to meet the demands of operatic performance, highlighting the adaptability of the corpus callosum to early, sustained sensorimotor training. By extending evidence from instrumental musicians to singers, these results underscore developmental timing as a key factor in how sensorimotor training shapes brain structure.

">Expression of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) in the Human Peripheral Nervous System: Implications for the Putative Pathogenic Role of FGFR3 Autoantibodies in Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Autoantibodies to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3-AAbs) have been associated with idiopathic sensory-predominant neuropathy. The pathogenicity of FGFR3-AAbs in this disorder is unknown. Pathogenic mechanisms of autoantibodies in other dysimmune neuropathies commonly involve their direct binding to antigens on either neurons or glia. The expression of FGFR3 in the human peripheral nervous system is unknown. Therefore, as an initial step toward clarifying the pathogenicity of FGFR3-AAbs, we characterized the expression of FGFR3 in nerve (hNerve), dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) and spinal cord (hSC) in human. Methods: FGFR3 mRNA was assayed via in situ hybridization (ISH) on post-mortem sections of hNerve, hDRG and hSC, and by re-analysis of RNA-sequencing data from hDRG. FGFR3 protein was assayed in these tissues using capillary electrophoretic immunoassays (CEIA) with several validated anti-FGFR3 antibodies. Results: FGFR3 mRNA was not detected in hNerve or hDRG but was abundant in hSC by ISH. FGFR3 protein was absent from hNerve and hDRG by CEIA but was moderately expressed in hSC. Discussion: A direct pathogenic mechanism of FGFR3-AAbs in sensory neuropathy would require the expression of FGFR3 in either neurons or non-neuronal cells in nerve or DRG. Using multiple methods, we did not detect FGFR3 expression at the mRNA or protein levels in these tissues. Given the absence of FGFR3 from hNerve and hDRG, it is improbable that FGFR3-AAbs cause direct damage to the neural components involved in neuropathy and thus are unlikely to be pathogenic, although indirect mechanisms via non-neural cells cannot be excluded.

">A correlative workflow streamlines synaptic imaging by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of intense research, the molecular organization of the synapse is not well understood. To address this issue, we sought to develop a method for systematic imaging of synapses by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a technology capable of mapping cellular architecture at molecular resolution. Thinning of cellular samples by cryo-focused ion beam milling is a prerequisite for high-quality cryo-ET imaging, but this process needs to be guided to the structures of interest. To allow robust synaptic targeting, we established a correlative cryo-light/electron microscopy approach by which synapses are fluorescently labeled in a minimally invasive manner, using a synthetic binder of the postsynaptic scaffold PSD-95 and antibodies against the presynaptic protein Synaptotagmin-1. Cryo-ET imaging at sites of colocalization consistently revealed excitatory synapses. Our method allows structural studies of synaptic protein complexes in situ, facilitating investigations of the molecular architecture of synapses.

">Distinct forms of amyloid-β moderate sleep duration through NAD+-linked redox metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disruptions precede a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by several years. However, how AD pathologies affect sleep remains unclear. Here, we integrate epidemiological data with insights from Drosophila models of AD to investigate how AD progression could be linked to sleep disruption. We found that individuals with a high risk of AD report a shorter sleep duration than do those with a clinical diagnosis of AD. We showed that the expression of different forms of amyloid-{beta} in flies can replicate these variations in sleep duration. Analysis of the metabolome and proteome of these flies revealed distinct changes in NAD+-linked redox metabolism and levels of hyperkinetic (Hk), a redox-sensing sleep homeostat. We showed that the genetic upregulation of Hk is neuroprotective and increased KCNAB2 expression in the brain decreases AD risk in humans. Overall, our data provides a new mechanism linking the disruption of NAD+-linked redox sensing and sleep disruption in AD.

">Parallel gene expression changes in ventral midbrain dopamine and GABA neurons during normal aging</a></h4>

              
                The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young (6-10 month) and old (>21 month) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Genes involved in serotonergic signaling were upregulated with age only in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.

">Metacognitive Reactivity and Temporal Perception: The Influence of Confidence Ratings on the Temporal Binding Window</a></h4>

              
                The influence of confidence in assessing the perceived timing of sensory events on perceptual decision-making remains poorly understood. Metacognition - the ability to reflect on one's thought processes - is often assessed through confidence ratings in perceptual tasks. However, accessing metacognitive information can influence task performance, a phenomenon known as the reactivity effect. This study examines metacognitive reactivity by examining the impact of confidence ratings on the temporal binding window (TBW) in two multisensory time perception tasks that use identical stimuli but require different judgments: Temporal Order Judgment (TOJ) and Simultaneity Judgment (SJ). Thirty-five participants (aged 18-39) completed TOJ and SJ tasks with and without confidence ratings via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Psychometric functions were fitted to response and confidence data to determine TBW and the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). Both tasks exhibited reactivity effects, with the effect being stronger in the SJ task. TBW significantly differed between TOJ and SJ tasks, regardless of confidence ratings. Additionally, TBWs from TOJ and SJ tasks were strongly correlated, as were the width parameters of confidence curves, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms in both perceptual and metacognitive processes. These findings highlight the utility of confidence ratings in evaluating TOJ and SJ performance, revealing both task differences and commonalities. We also discuss the potential for training interventions to enhance temporal perception, particularly in older adults. Finally, we reflect on the advantages and challenges of online data collection via Prolific, including its diverse participant pool and timing precision limitations.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Aphasia is a neurological condition affecting the ability to understand and/or express language fluently and accurately, and can occur following stroke, traumatic injuries, or other brain pathologies. The aim of the following study was to provide clinicians and researchers information regarding the existing assessment tools to assess aphasia. Methods: For this Systematic Review, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for articles published up to August 2024. Authors independently identified eligible studies based on predefined inclusion criteria and extracted data. The study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Results: Of the 1278 publications identified and screened, 238 studies fell within the inclusion criteria and were critically reviewed, and 164 assessment tools were found and divided into 8 main domains; the most used tools were the Language Screening Test (LAST), the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale-39 (SAQOL-39), the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), and the Token test. Conclusions: This review has emphasized the need for agreement among researchers as to which tool must be studied or adapted to other national contexts to develop universal norms and standards.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), also known as transcutaneous electroacupuncture stimulation, delivers electrical pulses to the skin over acupuncture points (&amp;amp;ldquo;acupoints&amp;amp;rdquo;) via surface electrodes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for assessing the changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that may result from applying different TEAS frequencies peripherally&amp;amp;mdash;i.e., acting via the peripheral nervous system (PNS)&amp;amp;mdash;and determining how these influence cerebral activity and neural plasticity. Methods: A total of 48 healthy volunteers were allocated in a semi-randomized crossover study to receive four different TEAS frequencies: 2.5 pulses per second (pps); 10 pps; 80 pps; and sham (160 pps at a low, clinically ineffective amplitude). TEAS was applied for 20 min to each hand at the acupuncture point Hegu (LI4). The EEG was recorded during an initial 5 min baseline recording, then during TEAS application, and after stimulation for a further 15 min, separated into three periods of 5 min (initial, intermediate, and final) in order to assess post-stimulation changes. Source localization analysis was conducted for the traditional five EEG frequency bands: delta (0.1&amp;amp;ndash;3.9 Hz), theta (4&amp;amp;ndash;7.9 Hz), alpha (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 Hz), beta (14&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz), and gamma (30.1&amp;amp;ndash;45 Hz). Results: Within-group source localization analyses of EEG data showed that during the initial 5 min post-stimulation, theta oscillations in the 2.5 pps TEAS group increased over the parahippocampal gyrus (t = 4.42, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The 10 pps TEAS group exhibited decreased alpha rhythms over the inferior parietal gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.20, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), whereas the sham (160 pps) TEAS group showed decreased delta rhythms over the postcentral gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;3.97, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). During the intermediate 5 min post-stimulation, the increased theta activity over the left parahippocampal gyrus (BA27) remained in the 2.5 pps TEAS group (t = 3.97, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). However, diminished alpha rhythms were observed in the 10 pps TEAS group over the postcentral gyrus (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.20, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as in the delta rhythms in the sham (160 pps) TEAS group in the same area (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.35, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). In the final 5 min post-stimulation, reduced alpha rhythms were exhibited over the insula in the 10 pps TEAS group (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.07, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Interaction effects of condition by group demonstrate decreased alpha rhythms in the 10 pps TEAS group over the supramarginal gyrus during the initial 5 min post-stimulation (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.31, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and decreased delta rhythms over the insula in the sham TEAS group during the final 5 min post-stimulation (t = &amp;amp;minus;4.42, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: This study revealed that low TEAS frequencies of 2.5 pps and 10 pps modulate theta and alpha oscillations over the brain areas related to emotional and attentional processes driven by external stimuli, as well as neural synchronization of delta rhythms in the sham group in brain areas related to stimulus expectation at baseline. It is hoped that these findings will stimulate further research in order to evaluate such TEAS modulation effects in clinical patients.</p>

     alt="Microglial Engulfment of Multisensory Terminals in the Midbrain Inferior Colliculus During an Early Critical Period"/>
<p>We used anterograde tracing and immunocytochemical approaches in living brain preparations to explore microglial involvement in the pruning of multisensory midbrain afferents. Experiments spanning an early postnatal critical period in the lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) demonstrate that the engulfment of auditory terminals from the neighboring central nucleus (CNIC) is developmentally regulated but not dependent upon fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) signaling. Individual CX3CR1-positive microglia phagocytose both auditory and somatosensory endings that largely colocalize with the lysosomal marker, CD68.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LCIC) receives multisensory input arrays that preferentially target its compartmental organization. Inputs of somatosensory origin end within modular zones, while auditory inputs terminate throughout an encompassing matrix. Such discrete mapping emerges during an early postnatal critical period (birth to postnatal day 12, P12) via a process of segregation. Similar to other primitive brain maps, it appears an initial excess of connections may be pruned through a refinement process. Microglial cells (MGCs) are involved in a variety of systems in the selective removal and degradation of unnecessary contacts. Aberrations in map plasticity during early critical periods have been associated with certain neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Despite evidence linking multisensory integration deficits with cognitive/behavioral disturbances associated with ASD, mechanisms that govern multimodal network modifications remain poorly understood. Thus, the present study combines novel tract-tracing approaches in living brain preparations and immunocytochemistry in CX3CR1-GFP knock-in mice to determine: (1) if fractalkine signaling (CX3CL1–CX3CR1) influences MGC engulfment of auditory afferents, (2) whether individual MGCs phagocytose endings of multisensory origin (auditory and somatosensory), and (3) whether consumed product is degraded via the MGC's lysosomal pathway. We demonstrate active MGC pruning of auditory endings at peak LCIC stages for projection shaping (P4, P8) that significantly decreases coincident with its critical period closure (P12). While developmentally regulated, auditory engulfment appears fractalkine signaling-independent. We also provide evidence that individual LCIC microglia engulf both auditory and somatosensory terminals that co-localize with the lysosomal marker, CD68. These results suggest a prominent role for microglia in the remodeling of early multisensory midbrain maps.</p>

">Modeling Organoid Population Electrophysiology Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Improving models to investigate neurodegenerative disease, neurodevelopmental disease, neurotoxicology and neuropharmacology is critical to improve our basic understanding of the human nervous system, as well as to accelerate discovery of interventions and drugs. Improved models of the human central nervous system could enable critical discoveries related to functional changes induced by sensory stimulation or toxic exposures. Neural organoids, complex three-dimensional cell cultures derived from adult human stem cells, have been grown with complex connectivity and neuroanatomy. Moreover, these cultures have been interfaced with bi-directional electrical stimulation and recording, as well as chemical stimulation. This effort sought to develop new computational techniques which could be applied to comparative studies using neural organoids. In particular, we adapted CEBRA, a state of the art model from the emph{in vivo} modeling literature, to generate 2D and 3D embeddings (projections into structured low-dimensional spaces) of high dimensional neural organoid electrophysiology data. This can be done in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. Results indicate these embeddings can be quickly and reliably generated and serve as a low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings for characterizing changes in neural organoid activity over time, as well as clustering results around known bursting phenomena. Moreover, we demonstrate that mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions can be used as a parametric model for these embedding spaces to enable statistics hypothesis testing. This technique may enable new types of comparative studies using neural organoids, and may be critical for creating a representation for quantitative comparison and validation of neural organoid models against human and animal data. Looking ahead, this work could allow the formulation of a new class of experiments investigating the functional impact of toxins, genetic manipulations, or pharmacological interventions on human neurons.

">Citrullination of TDP-43 is a key post-translation modification associated with structural and functional changes and progressive pathology in TDP-43 mouse models and human proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is associated with a spectrum of clinical dementias including limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological changes (LATE-NC). Post-translational modifications (PTM) are linked to TDP-43 toxic gain-of- function and cytoplasmic aggregation 1-3. Phosphorylation remains the most investigated PTM and a standard criterion for determining pathology progression and clinical subclassification in TDP-43 proteinopathies 4-7. However, full spectrum of PTMs on TDP-43 structure and biology remain unknown. Utilizing mass-spectrometry analysis we identified citrullination as a novel and irreversible bona fide PTM of TDP-43 protein. We recognized peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 and 4 (PAD2 and PAD4) to mediate the conversion of arginine (R) to citrulline (citR) in vitro and demonstrated increased PAD2 and PAD4 expression and TDP-43 citrullination in a human wildtype TDP-43 mouse model (Tg (Thy1-TARDBP4). Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis revealed citrullination induced vast structural changes while ThT analysis demonstrated altered aggregation kinetics of citrullinated (citR) TDP-43 protein. We further provided mechanistic evidence on reduced electrostatic and pi-pi interactions of citR TDP-43 Low Complexity Domain (LCD) with RNA, favoring liquid-solid phase separation and condensate formation. Generation and validation of several citR TDP-43 specific antibodies against several TDP-43 epitopes revealed epitope and domain-specific effects of citrullination on TDP-43 solubility in vivo. Importantly, we found distinct reactivities of citR TDP-43 antibodies shedding light into the contribution of epitope-specific properties of human citR TDP-43 to novel pathological citR TDP-43 assemblies in human brain tissue from LATE-NC, with or without comorbid Alzheimers disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). These findings provided a unique look into the temporal citR TDP-43 signatures, and the potential clinical relevance associated with progression of pure LATE-NC and comorbid ADNC + LATE-NC. Collectively, these data reveal the existence of irreversible TDP-43 citrullination at targeted sites via induced PAD2/ PAD4 activities, presenting a critical step in TDP-43 proteinopathy.

">An automated two-choice social operant task for probing moment-to-moment changes in social satiety</a></h4>

              
                In naturalistic conditions, animals must routinely make ongoing self-motivated choices about whether to initiate interactions with same or opposite-sex partners and whether to re-initiate social contact when interactions have ended. However, it remains unclear what governs these choices, and whether they are motivated by drive states that exhibit signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety when these interactions have ended. Here, to explicitly test this at the behavioral level, we designed a novel fully-automated two-choice social operant paradigm where individuals can choose between same and opposite-sex social rewards and rewards are delivered for interaction with systematically varying durations. We trained cohorts of both sexes on this task and quantified the patterns of choices. We used choice latency as a metric to infer moment-to-moment satiety to test whether increased interaction duration leads to increased moment-to-moment satiety. We find that although both males and females have stable choice biases across sessions, with males showing consistent opposite sex biases, only males exhibit behavioral signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety and are sensitive to the duration of interaction. Using a simple normative model to capture patterns of social choice, we observe that behavior is better fit by a model that has a single evolving social drive and choice bias, rather than a model with multiple, independent drives for same and opposite-sex interactions. Together, our data reveal behavioral signatures of social satiety and offer new insights into the underlying homeostatic and motivational drives that govern social choices.

">EasyEyes: Crowded Dynamic Fixation for Online Psychophysics</a></h4>

              
                Online vision testing enables efficient data collection from diverse participants but requires accurate fixation. Fixation accuracy is traditionally ensured by using a camera to track gaze. That works well in the lab, but tracking during online testing with a built-in webcam is not yet sufficiently precise. Kurzawski, Pombo, et al. (2023) introduced a fixation task that improves fixation through hand-eye coordination, requiring participants to track a moving crosshair with a mouse-controlled cursor. This dynamic fixation task greatly reduces peeking at peripheral targets relative to a stationary fixation task, but does not eliminate it. Here, we enhance fixation further by leveraging "crowding," adding clutter around the fixation mark - a method we call crowded dynamic fixation. We assessed fixation accuracy during peripheral threshold measurement. Relative to the RMS gaze error during the stationary fixation task, dynamic fixation error was 61%, while crowded dynamic fixation error was only 47%. With a 1.5-degree tolerance, peeking occurred on 9% of trials with stationary fixation, 4% with dynamic fixation, and 0% with crowded dynamic fixation. This improvement eliminated implausibly low peripheral thresholds, likely by preventing peeking. We conclude that crowded dynamic fixation enables accurate gaze control for online testing.

">Behavioural and neurogenetic evidence for emotion primitives in the fruit fly Drosophila: insights from the Open Field Test</a></h4>

              
                Emotions, defined as transient states preparing organisms for adaptive responses, are thought to be based on evolutionarily conserved building blocks ("emotion primitives") that are present across mammalian and other vertebrate species. Whether and to which extent these building blocks are found in insects is largely undefined. In this study, we employ the open field test in fruit flies and focus on wall-following and total walking activity as behavioural indicators of emotion-like states.

Wildtype and transgenic flies were subjected to various conditions, including social isolation, starvation, and exposure to anxiolytic substances prior to behavioural testing in the open field test. The results indicate that wall-following and total walking activity are modulated by these conditions, with generally increased wall-following observed under aversive stimuli and decreased values under positive conditions. Notably, the behaviour was consistent across different times of the day and independent of circadian rhythms. Genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory systems, such as serotonin, dopamine, and neuropeptide F, supports the role of these pathways in modulating emotion-like states in the fruit fly. Activation of reward-related neurons decreased wall-following, while inhibition increased it, aligning with known effects in mammalian models. Additionally, pharmacological treatments with ethanol and diazepam produced predictable changes in wall-following and total walking activity, reinforcing the validity of the open field test as a measure of emotion-like states in the fly.

The findings suggest that Drosophila exhibits core emotion-like states, with wall-following and total walking activity serving as reliable indicators of emotional valence and arousal. Our results promote the use of Drosophila as a powerful genetic model to dissect the neuronal and neurochemical substrates of emotion primitives, shedding light on the evolution of basic emotional processing mechanisms.

">Amphetamine in Adolescence Induces a Sex-Specific Mesolimbic Dopamine Phenotype in the Adult Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Drugs of abuse in adolescence impact brain maturation and increase psychiatric risk, with differences in sensitivity between males and females. Amphetamine in adolescent male, but not female mice, causes dopamine axons intended to innervate the nucleus accumbens and to grow ectopically to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is mediated by drug-induced downregulation of the Netrin-1 receptor DCC. How off-target dopamine axons function in the adult PFC remains to be determined. Here we report that males and females show place preference for amphetamine in adolescence. However, only in males, amphetamine increases PFC dopamine transporter expression in adulthood: leading to aberrant baseline dopamine transients, faster dopamine release, and exaggerated responses to acute methylphenidate. Upregulation of DCC in adolescence, using CRISPRa, prevents all these changes. Mesolimbic dopamine axons rerouted to the PFC in adolescence retain anatomical and functional phenotypes of their intended target, rendering males enduringly vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs of abuse.

">Metaplastic priming enables non-ionotropic NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic depotentiation in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The reversal of learning-induced synaptic potentiation through depotentiation is thought to underlie forgetting and can be influenced by prior synaptic activity. Here, we evaluated how such metaplastic alterations manifest at the synaptic level. In hippocampal slices obtained from male and female mice, we artificially induced long-term potentiation (LTP) using either a temporally spaced or compressed stimulation pattern. Using a combination of electrophysiology and protein quantification approaches, we found divergent molecular pathways recruited during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Depotentiation of both forms of LTP required glutamatergic activation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). However, only depotentiation of spaced LTP required ionotropic NMDAR signaling, while ion flux-independent, or non-ionotropic, NMDAR signaling was necessary and sufficient for depotentiation of compressed LTP. Downstream of NMDAR signaling, AMPA receptor phosphorylation was also differentially modified during depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP. Finally, we found that spaced but not compressed depotentiation required synaptic Arc. Together, our results reveal that the temporal pattern of prior LTP induction exerts a metaplastic influence on the molecular pathways recruited during the induction and expression of depotentiation. Our findings have important implications for the regulation of both physiological and pathological forgetting.

Significance statementSynaptic depotentiation, the reversal of learning-associated synaptic potentiation, is an important mechanism of forgetting. This study uncovers how prior synaptic activity modifies the molecular mechanisms underlying depotentiation in the hippocampus in a metaplastic manner. We reveal that the mechanisms of NMDA-receptor depotentiation depend on the temporal spacing of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. Specifically, we show that non-ionotropic NMDA receptor signaling is necessary and sufficient for the depotentiation of LTP induced using temporally compressed but not spaced patterned activity. Further, depotentiation of spaced and compressed LTP are associated with distinct downstream signaling pathways and AMPA receptor phosphorylation states during depotentiation. Our results illuminate fundamental mechanisms that govern plasticity associated with forgetting, with implications for memory preservation in disease states.

">Dynamically rich states in balanced networks induced by single-neuron dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Network states with rich dynamics and highly variable firing rates of individual neurons are prominent in experimental observations and thought to benefit complex information processing and learning. Such states have been proposed to arise from properties of network coupling, like a strong connectivity or slow synaptic dynamics. Here, we identify an alternative mechanism based on weak synaptic coupling and intrinsic cellular dynamics. We show that a switch in the cellular excitability class of action-potential generation (via a switch in the underlying mathematical bifurcation), further amplified by recurrent interactions, results in super-Poissonian spiking variability in random balanced networks. Information encoding is shifted to higher frequency bands and collective chaos in the network is enhanced when intrinsic cellular dynamics follow a saddle homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation. The robust effect links the biophysics of individual neurons to collective dynamics of large random networks, highlighting the relevance of single-cell dynamics for computation in physiological and artificial networks.

">Temporal Propagation of Neural State Boundaries in Naturalistic Context</a></h4>

              
                Our senses receive a continuous stream of complex information, which we segment into discrete events. Previous research has related such events to neural states: temporally and regionally specific stable patterns of brain activity. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether there was evidence for top-down or bottom-up propagation of neural state boundaries. To do so, we used intracranial measurements with high temporal resolution while subjects were watching a movie. As this is the first study of neural states in intracranial data in the context of event segmentation, we also investigated whether known properties of neural states could be replicated. The neural state boundaries indeed aligned with stimulus features and between brain areas. Importantly, we found evidence for top-down propagation of neural state boundaries at the onsets and offsets of clauses. Interestingly, we did not observe a consistent top-down or bottom-up propagation in general across all timepoints, suggesting that neural state boundaries could propagate in both a top-down and bottom-up manner, with the direction depending on the stimulus input at that moment. Taken together, our findings provide new insights on how neural state boundaries are shared across brain regions and strengthen the foundation of studying neural states in electrophysiology.

">Biologically realistic mean field model of spiking neural networks with fast and slow inhibitory synapses</a></h4>

              
                We present a mean field model for a spiking neural network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with fast GABAA and nonlinear slow GABAB inhibitory conductance-based synapses. This mean field model can predict the spontaneous and evoked response of the network to external stimulation in asynchronous irregular regimes. The model displays theta oscillations for sufficiently strong GABAB conductance. Optogenetic activation of interneurons and an increase of GABAB conductance caused opposite effects on the emergence of gamma oscillations in the model. In agreement with direct numerical simulations of neural networks and experimental data, the mean field model predicts that an increase of GABAB conductance reduces gamma oscillations. Furthermore, the slow dynamics of GABAB synapses regulates the appearance and duration of transient gamma oscillations, namely gamma bursts, in the mean field model. Finally, we show that nonlinear GABAB synapses play a major role to stabilize the network from the emergence of epileptic seizures.

">Laterality and interhemispheric integration in the larval Drosophila olfactory system</a></h4>

              
                All animals with bilateral symmetry must integrate the sensory input from the left and right sides of their bodies to make coherent perceptual decisions. In Drosophila larvae, connectomic evidence suggests that olfactory signals from the two sides of the head are initially processed independently (as in the mammalian olfactory system) before being combined in the central brain. By pairing volumetric calcium imaging in intact larvae with microfluidic odor delivery and targeted laser ablation at the sensory periphery, we have mapped the propagation of olfactory signals between the two brain hemispheres, across successive layers of the larval olfactory system. This approach implicates the mushroom body (MB) as a key substrate for interhemispheric integration of odor representations. Whereas the two larval MBs appear to process odors largely independently at the level of their intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells), the modulatory neurons of the MB show strongly symmetrized responses to asymmetric olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, odor responses in some MB output neurons (MBONs), up to 5 synapses downstream from the sensory periphery, preserve information about stimulus laterality. Moreover, we show that asymmetric activation of these MBONs can modulate the animals turning behavior in a side-biased manner. These findings suggest that the deeply lateralized architecture of the larval olfactory system balances the need for interhemispheric integration with the advantages of parallel sensory processing.

Despite its application, the genetic underpinnings of FOCA alterations in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remain largely unexplored. To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal–parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein–protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maple syrup urine disease is a rare metabolic disorder that results in neurodevelopmental injury despite dietary therapy. While structural neuroimaging has shown a characteristic pattern of edema and white matter injury, no functional neuroimaging studies of maple syrup urine disease have been performed. Using widefield optical imaging, we investigated resting-state functional connectivity in two brain-specific mouse models of maple syrup urine disease (an astrocyte-specific knockout and a whole-brain knockout). At 8 weeks, mouse functional neuroimaging was performed using a custom-built widefield optical imaging system. Imaging was performed before and after initiation of a high-protein diet for 1 week to mimic metabolic crisis, which we hypothesized would result in decreased functional connectivity strength. Data were analyzed using seed-based functional connectivity and cluster-based inference. Astrocyte-specific knockout mice developed increased contralateral functional connectivity within the posteromedial somatosensory cortex after diet initiation. Whole-brain knockout mice had a similar pattern present at baseline, which persisted after diet initiation. Thus, contrary to expectations, maple syrup urine disease resulted in increased functional connectivity strength, especially after diet initiation. While the underlying etiology of these changes is unclear, these results demonstrate that inborn errors of metabolism result in changes to functional connectivity networks. Further research may demonstrate functional neuroimaging biomarkers that could be translated to clinical care.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A substantial body of literature has focused on neural signals evoked by errors emerging during the execution of goal-directed actions. It is still unclear how motor cortex activity during movement execution relates to feedback error processing. To investigate this, we recorded primary motor cortex (M1) single-unit activity in rats during a grasping task. About half of the recorded neurons showed modulation of their firing activity that did not depend on success or failure, which we termed outcome-independent neurons. Other neurons showed a difference in their discharge profile when comparing successful and unsuccessful trials, which we called outcome-dependent neurons. Among both outcome-dependent and -independent neurons, we further distinguished neurons presenting their maximum firing rate in specific epochs as defined by the task. We compared the cortical distribution of outcome-independent and outcome-dependent neurons to cortical maps of complex forelimb movements evoked by intracortical microstimulation in additional animals. The majority of outcome-independent neurons was localized within the limb extension and paw open-closure movement representations. Outcome-dependent neurons were not clearly associated to particular motor representations. Cortical arrangement of neurons, both outcome-independent and outcome-dependent, and their correlation with distinct movement representations, can serve as indicator for anticipating potential outcomes before the conclusion of an action.</span>

Geometric eigenmode decomposition of advanced concentrative absorption meditation and non-meditative control task fMRI data revealed elevated global brain state power and energy patterns of specific advanced concentrative absorption meditation states compared to controls, with mid-frequency spectrum brain state power and energy following a non-random, cubic trajectory through the advanced concentrative absorption meditation sequence.

This study unites precise methodological design, a novel fMRI decomposition framework, and rigorous phenomenology to provide valuable insights into the distributed neural signatures of highly refined conscious states.

	<p>Background: In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) there is blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which should increase the CSF formation rate (CSFfr) and, therefore, also increase the intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the ICP is normal in NPH. A lumped parameter study was performed to look at the interrelation between the ICP, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the degree of BBB disruption in NPH. The model suggested that the CSFfr could be reduced in this condition if the BBB disruption was moderated by a reduction in the capillary transmural pressure (TMP) secondary to arteriolar constriction and a reduced CBF. In early Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), there is BBB disruption, reduced ICP, and global ischemia. This raises the possibility that the same physiology may occur in AD as occurs in NPH. Methods: A lumped parameter model previously used to describe the hydrodynamics of NPH was modified to investigate the effects of changes in CSF pressure and blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Results: The model indicates that the average capillary TMP is normal in MCI, but decreases as AD progresses. Removing CSF in AD patients during a tap test initially increases the capillary TMP. The brain in AD responds to a tap test by increasing its level of ischemia, and this reduces the capillary TMP. Conclusions: A hypothesis is put forward that the BBB disruption in AD is partially mitigated by the brain making itself ischemic. Modelling gives support to this hypothesis. The model can suggest a cause for the development of ischemic neuronal loss and amyloid accumulation secondary to glymphatic flow disruption as AD progresses.</p>

	<p>The search for biological markers that can be reliably linked to aggression and antisocial behavior has been central to the work of biological criminology. One such marker, uric acid, has long been suspected to play a causative role in promoting anger, irritability, aggression, and violence. Here, in this perspective article, we revisit some of the historical interest in uric acid as a compound relevant to brain and behavior, and reflect these early accounts off emergent scientific research. Advances in brain sciences, including neuropsychiatry and neuromicrobiology, have allowed for a more sophisticated understanding of potential mechanistic pathways linking uric acid with cognition and behavior. The updated science suggests that some of the early ideas surrounding uric acid and criminology had credibility. The available research strongly suggests that uric acid, as a potential biomarker of risk, is worthy of further research and close scrutiny. Informed by emergent gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain&amp;amp;ndash;microbiome research, we argue that certain aspects of early-to-mid-20th-century biological criminology were prematurely abandoned. From a legalome perspective, further advances surrounding uric acid and other gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain biomarkers can aid in shaping more humane, scientifically grounded policies that recognize the interplay between biology and environment.</p>

                <p><i>GBA1</i> variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (<i>ATP10D</i>), not <i>GBA1</i>, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in <i>GBA1</i>-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this pilot study is to qualitatively describe the use of life history questionnaires in an acute neurorehabilitation setting to define individualised goals of care for patients with clinical cognitive motor dissociation and to determine to what extent the information they contain influences the care and management provided by the team. Methods: Using the patient records of our sample, all individualised goals of care were summarised, which were subsequently used to assess whether life history questionnaires had supplied sufficient information to define various individualised goals of care. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the involved healthcare professionals to gain insights on how these questionnaires were used. Results: Approximately one-third of all individualised goals of care belonging to the &amp;amp;ldquo;Activities and Participation&amp;amp;rdquo; ICF category were defined through life history questionnaires. The semi-structured interviews highlighted the impact of these questionnaires in three main aspects: creating a therapeutic alliance with the patient, facilitating multidisciplinary cohesion, and nurturing a sense of empathy amongst the healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Life history questionnaires are an important contribution to individualised goals of care and may improve the relationship with the patient and the therapeutic setting for all healthcare professionals involved.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Accurate survival prediction for brain metastasis patients undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is crucial for personalized treatment planning and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to estimate survival times, providing clinicians with a reliable tool for making informed decisions based on individual patient characteristics. The goal was to compare the performance of multiple algorithms and identify the most effective model for clinical use. Methods: We applied a hybrid machine learning approach to predict survival in brain metastasis patients treated with SRT, utilizing real-world data. Four algorithms&amp;amp;mdash;XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting&amp;amp;mdash;were compared within a meta-model framework to identify the most accurate for survival prediction. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and C index. Results: XGBoost outperformed all other algorithms, achieving an MSE of 0.14%, MAE of 0.10%, and MAPE of 0.093%, with a high C-index of 100%. CatBoost showed reasonable performance, while Gradient Boosting had higher error rates (MSE of 6.99%, MAE of 21.04%, MAPE of 19.29%). Random Forest performed the weakest, with the highest MSE (14.39%), MAE (30.23%), and MAPE (33.58%). Conclusion: Inputting relevant clinical variables into the model enables clinicians to obtain highly accurate survival predictions for patients with brain metastasis. This enhances clinical decision making by providing a more precise understanding of expected outcomes. The XGBoost-based hybrid model showed exceptional accuracy in predicting survival for brain metastasis patients after SRT, offering valuable support for clinical decision making. Integrating machine learning into clinical practice can improve treatment planning and personalize care for these patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sleep plays a pivotal role in memory consolidation, especially for declarative memory. While extensive research has examined sleep&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on simple declarative materials, such as word lists, its effect on more complex narrative passages remains less studied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep on prose memory consolidation. Methods: In a within-subjects design, 10 healthy university students (6 F, 4 M; age range = 19&amp;amp;ndash;29; generation ratio = 0.8) learned prose passages and were tested both immediately and after a retention interval spent either asleep or awake. Results: The analyses revealed a positive effect of sleep, with the participants recalling more textual details in the Sleep condition (R2 conditional = 0.269). Correlational analyses further supported this outcome, showing a positive association between specific sleep features (i.e., sleep cycles) and prose memory performance (r2 = 0.56). Conclusions: Our finding suggests that sleep facilitates the consolidation of complex declarative memory traces, counteracting the decay that occurs during wakefulness; correlational analyses further support this outcome. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of sleep for everyday learning and comprehension, particularly when processing complex textual information.</p>

                Abstract Mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare but life-threatening, and are associated with high morbidity and mortality after operative repair. They frequently present at a late stage with sepsis and rupture; therefore, emergency management is paramount. Repair options, particularly in the thoracic aorta, are complex and include open, endovascular, and hybrid surgical approaches. We present the case of a 72-year-old woman with a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm who underwent successful endovascular repair with thoracic stent graft placement and left subclavian artery embolization. This case highlights the successful use of endovascular repair for the management of a ruptured mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm in zone 2, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and potential benefits of minimally invasive repair in these rare complex cases.

                In 2024 the Cross-Strait Conflict between Taipei and Beijing turned 75 years old. Using an eclectic conflict analysis framework, this paper lays out the evolution of the conflict, its main actors, and traces the fundamental shift of its core-issue from “who is China” to “what is Taiwan.” Realist concepts of international relations are used to argue that it is important to imagine political scenarios not ending in warfare to escape the escalatory spiral and a self-fulfilling prophecy. The rhetoric of warfare, distorted views on history, and Great Power competition are destabilizing factors that push toward an escalation that will result in warfare if they are not counterbalanced by refocusing the relationship on common ground. A peaceful way forward, the paper argues, does not need to solve the underlying conflict between the PRC and the ROC, it only needs to mitigate their red lines long enough for new reconciliation strategies to emerge that re-channel the core-issue into a constructive conflict, which, over time, can lead to permanent reconciliation.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                <p>by Marnix H. Medema, Gilles P. van Wezel</p>

With the explosive increase in genome sequence data, perhaps the major challenge in natural-product-based drug discovery is the identification of gene clusters most likely to specify new chemistry and bioactivities. We discuss the challenges and state-of-the-art of antibiotic discovery based on ecological principles, genome mining and artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003046">Innovations in noninvasive sensory stimulation treatments to combat Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jung M. Park, Li-Huei Tsai</p>

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003043">Incomplete recombination suppression fuels extensive haplotype diversity in a butterfly colour pattern supergene</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishi De-Kayne, Ian J. Gordon, Reinier F. Terblanche, Steve Collins, Kennedy Saitoti Omufwoko, Dino J. Martins, Simon H. Martin</p>

Supergenes can evolve when recombination-suppressing mechanisms like inversions promote co-inheritance of alleles at two or more polymorphic loci that affect a complex trait. Theory shows that such genetic architectures can be favoured under balancing selection or local adaptation in the face of gene flow, but they can also bring costs associated with reduced opportunities for recombination. These costs may in turn be offset by rare ‘gene flux’ between inverted and ancestral haplotypes, with a range of possible outcomes. We aimed to shed light on these processes by investigating the BC supergene, a large genomic region comprising multiple rearrangements associated with three distinct wing colour morphs in <i>Danaus chrysippus</i>, a butterfly known as the African monarch, African queen and plain tiger. Using whole-genome resequencing data from 174 individuals, we first confirm the effects of BC on wing colour pattern: background melanism is associated with SNPs in the promoter region of <i>yellow</i>, within an inverted subregion of the supergene, while forewing tip pattern is most likely associated with copy-number variation in a separate subregion of the supergene. We then show that haplotype diversity within the supergene is surprisingly extensive: there are at least six divergent haplotype groups that experience suppressed recombination with respect to each other. Despite high divergence between these haplotype groups, we identify an unexpectedly large number of natural recombinant haplotypes. Several of the inferred crossovers occurred between adjacent inversion ‘modules’, while others occurred within inversions. Furthermore, we show that new haplotype groups have arisen through recombination between two pre-existing ones. Specifically, an allele for dark colouration in the promoter of <i>yellow</i> has recombined into distinct haplotype backgrounds on at least two separate occasions. Overall, our findings paint a picture of dynamic evolution of supergene haplotypes, fuelled by incomplete recombination suppression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-244/v1?src=rss">Scaling up community participation in watershed management for food security improvement: the case of Qarsa woreda , East Haraghe zone, Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The watershed management approach has been well-acknowledged as an effective strategy for improving food security. However, the significance of community engagement, which is vital for the success of this strategy, has not been adequately acknowledged. The study examined the level of community involvement and the factors influencing their participation in watershed management. Methods A household survey of 337 household heads, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, a people participation index, and a binary regression model were used for data analysis. Result The results of the people participation index indicated a moderate level of farmers’ participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation phases, with no significant differences observed between the three micro watersheds. However, there were variations in the indicator metrics within and across the micro watersheds, with participants from the Sustainable Land Management Program II (SLMPII), micro watershed showing significant differences compared to those from the Productive Safety Net Public work (PSNP_PW) and free mass mobilization at levels of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. The results of binary logistic regression indicated that the overall level of farmer participation was significantly affected by the frequency of extension contact, livestock ownership, education level, family size, and group membership. Conclusions The study highlights the need to consider variability in indicator measurements for effective watershed management to improve food security. It stresses the importance of building farmers’ capacity and fostering ownership, rather than simply providing them with explícitas instructions to follow.
