">Post-inhibitory rebound firing drives hypothalamic activation for male mating</a></h4>

              
                Many behaviorally relevant limbic circuits are dominated by inhibitory connections, raising the question of how neuronal activation arises in such contexts. In male mating, both activation of mPOA and its inhibitory inputs are essential - a paradox previously ascribed to disinhibition. Here, we show that the mPOA largely lacks local inhibitory circuits, arguing against disinhibition. Instead, in vivo recordings reveal that mount-active mPOA neurons are suppressed prior to behavioral onset, and this inhibition negatively correlates with subsequent activation, consistent with post-inhibitory rebound firing (PIR). A biologically plausible conductance-based model demonstrates that synaptic inhibition interacts with T-type Ca 2+ currents - the ionic basis of PIR - to promote mPOA neuron firing. Experimentally, bidirectional manipulations of mPOA T-type Ca 2+ channels confirm this mechanism: knockdown reduces PIR and impairs male mating, while over-expression enhances mating. Together, these results identify PIR as a critical mechanism by which inhibition promotes activation in limbic circuits to drive male mating.

                Shinkawa et al. identify effector and dysfunctional states among lung CD8+ T cells during chronic tuberculosis in C57BL/6 mice. The most differentially expressed gene between the two states is CD226, which costimulates recognition of infected macrophages. Loss of CD226 expression correlates with development of CD8+ T cell exhaustion during tuberculosis.

">Neural and behavioral correlates of evidence accumulation in human click-based echolocation</a></h4>

              
                Echolocation enables blind individuals to perceive and navigate their environment by emitting clicks and interpreting their returning echoes. While expert blind echolocators demonstrate remarkable spatial accuracy, the behavioral and neural mechanisms supporting the temporal integration of spatial echoacoustic cues remain less explored. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of spatial information accumulation in human click-based echolocation using EEG. Blind expert echolocators and novice sighted participants localized virtual spatialized echoes derived from realistic synthesized mouth clicks, with trials presenting trains of 2-11 clicks. Behavioral results showed that blind expert echolocators significantly outperformed sighted controls in spatial localization. For these experts, localization thresholds decreased with more clicks, indicating cumulative integration of spatial cues across repeated samples. EEG decoding analyses revealed that neural representations significantly distinguished echo laterality and predicted overall spatial localization performance from the first click alone. Additionally, brain responses relative to the first click evolved systematically over successive clicks, paralleling psychophysical performance in blind echolocators and providing a possible index of perceptual information accumulation. These findings provide, to our knowledge, the first fine-grained account of temporal neural dynamics underlying click-based echolocation, directly linked to behavioral performance over multiple samples. They reveal how successive echoes are integrated over time into coherent spatial representations. Together, these results advance our understanding of the perceptual and neural mechanisms underlying echolocation and demonstrate adaptive sensory processing in the absence of vision.

">GephyrinΔ199-233 - an epileptogenic microdeletion</a></h4>

              
                Gephyrin, as the main organizer of inhibitory synapses, is crucial for inhibitory signal transmission, and implicated in various neurological disorders. Various studies have identified gephyrin microdeletions in conditions of autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Those deletions affected the N-terminal G-domain and/or the central C-domain of gephyrin while the receptor binding C-terminal E-domain was not affected. Here, we investigated the importance of a specific microdeletion ({triangleup}199-233) within the C-domain using a full-body knock-in mouse model. Homozygous mice displayed a severe phenotype characterized by reduced fertility, increased mortality, and neurological deficits at early developmental stages. Analyses in dissociated hippocampal neurons demonstrated disrupted synaptic targeting of gephyrin {triangleup}199-233 that harbors the functionally important S-palmitoylation site at Cys212. Simultaneously, we found adaptations at the excitatory synapse, with smaller, but more numerous clusters of the excitatory scaffolding protein PSD95. Although, gephyrin {triangleup}199-233 showed unexpectedly a facilitated receptor interaction, inhibitory signal transmission was reduced. We hypothesize, that the gephyrin {triangleup}199-233-mediated reduction of inhibition triggers compensatory excitation, which possibly fails and/or disrupts the excitation/inhibition ratio in our mouse model. These findings highlight the critical role of the gephyrin C-domain and its post-translational modifications in synaptic function and neuronal health, offering a novel mouse model for the development of potential therapeutic targets addressing gephyrin-associated neurological disorders.

">Embryonic Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 37 AUUUC Repeat RNA Causes Neurodevelopmental Defects in Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Onset of many neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases usually starts in adulthood; however, recent advances point toward neurodevelopmental changes as drivers of late neurodegeneration. How early neuropathological features occur in these conditions remains unclear, which is critical for timely therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide evidence that neurodevelopmental axonal defects initiate a motor phenotype in a zebrafish model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 37 (SCA37), a degenerative hereditary condition caused by an ATTTC repeat in the DAB1 gene. We investigated neuronal defects triggered by the embryonic AUUUC repeat RNA and their effects later in life by transiently expressing this RNA in embryos and analyzing innervation and motor function. We found abnormalities in motor neuron axonal outgrowth and muscle innervation. We also discovered disrupted embryonic motor activity and reduced locomotor distance and velocity in late adult zebrafish, demonstrating motor impairment. Moreover, we showed that NOVA2 expression rescues axonal defects, indicating dysfunction of NOVA2-regulated neurodevelopmental processes. Overall, our results establish embryonic expression of the AUUUC repeat RNA as a driver of axonal and synaptic abnormalities, interfering with neuronal circuits and culminating in adult motor dysfunction.

">Automated image segmentation uncovers the role of CD74high human microglia in cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                The role of activated microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established; the proportion of stage III activated microglia has been associated with AD and cognitive decline, but this morphologically defined subtype is relatively uncommon (1-2% of microglia) and its cellular function is unknown. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed CD74 as a marker gene that is enriched in immunologically active microglial subtypes associated with AD. Here, we evaluated the relationship between CD74 expression, AD-related traits, and microglial morphology using dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from two brain collections (ROSMAP: n=63, NYBB: n=91). An image segmentation pipeline using CellProfiler was developed to extract features from entire tissue sections. The pipeline automatically delineated gray and white matter regions and segmented 1,120,780 gray matter microglia. In a meta-analysis of the two datasets, we find an increase in frequency of microglia with high CD74 expression (CD74high) in relation to AD dementia (p = 0.038), particularly in the phase of terminal, accelerated cognitive decline before death. These microglia have a more rounded, amoeboid shape (ROSMAP: p = 1.4x10-6; NYBB: p = 2x10-13) which is a characteristic morphology of activated stage III microglia. Results were consistent across both datasets, highlighting the robustness of our cellular segmentation approach. This study identifies a potential role for CD74high microglia and the CD74 ligand MIF in cognitive decline, and it provides evidence for a partially overlapping but distinct role for CD74high microglia and morphologically defined stage III microglia, whose functional properties have remained poorly understood. These CD74high microglia appear to be enriched for genes involved in cytokine response for class I and II antigen presentation, as well as regulation of T cell proliferation. These findings begin to link microglial subtypes defined by single-cell transcriptomic data with those characterized by classical morphological criteria to resolve the roles of different microglial functions to distinct stages in the trajectory to AD.

">Molecular Architecture and Function Mechanism of Tri-heteromeric GluN1-N2-N3A NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a pivotal role in brain development and synaptic function. Previous studies have focused on GluN1-N2 (2A-2D) and GluN1-N3 (3A and 3B) di-heteromeric (di-) NMDARs, leaving the activation mechanism and stoichiometry of GluN1-N2-N3 tri-heteromeric (tri-) NMDARs largely unexplored. In this study, we employed a two-step affinity-tagged chromatography approach to purify recombinantly expressed GluN1-N2A-N3A tri-NMDARs and determined their cryo-EM structure. Based on the proteoliposome single-channel recording, we discovered GluN1-N2A-N3A can be activated upon co-binding of glycine and glutamate, exhibiting two distinct conductance levels. Furthermore, leveraging structural-based click-chemistry, we introduced photo-crosslinker p-azido-phenylalanine (AzF) into the N-terminal domain of GluN2A and GluN2B, enabling the crosslinking with GluN3A subunit both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide molecular insights into the subunit arrangement, native architecture and activation mechanism of GluN1-N2-N3A tri-NMDARs and also highlight the complexity of NMDAR assembly and function in the brain.

">Molecular aging is the main driver of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Aging as well as the presence of a-synuclein (a-syn) oligomers in the brain are indisputably linked to Parkinsons disease (PD). A central concept of geroscience is that the biological processes of aging drive the onset of aging-associated diseases. The extent to which the biological processes of aging directly contribute to PD and the inter-relationship with a-syn oligomers for the onset of PD symptoms remains unclear. Using an inducible a-syn oligomer mouse model of PD, we demonstrate that the induction of PD associated a-syn oligomers for the same timespan caused PD associated symptoms only in aged, but not in young mice. Biochemical studies revealed that a-syn oligomer formation precedes motor decline in these aged mice, and age together with a-syn expression determine the motor phenotype. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) identified a PD disease signature that was particularly linked to basal ganglia neurons (BGNs) and was in part shared with an aging transcriptional signature. PD symptoms, as well as the PD Signature, were significantly altered by a short-term pharmacological attenuation of the activity of the small RhoGTPase CDC42 in already aged animals with PD symptoms. Attenuation of activity of CDC42 is known to target the general biological processes of aging. Interestingly, the intervention did not affect the amount of a-syn oligomers in the animals, while still improving phenotypes. Together, the data demonstrates that the biological processes of aging are a major causative driver for the onset of PD in the a-syn model of PD.

">Mice wiggle a wheel to boost the salience of low visual contrast stimuli</a></h4>

              
                From the Welsh tidy mouse to the New York City pizza rat, movement reveals rodent intelligence. Akin to humans shaking a computer mouse to find the cursor on a screen, we show that head-fixed mice develop an active sensing strategy in a visual perceptual decision-making task (The International Brian Laboratory, 2021). We demonstrate that mice wiggle a wheel that controls the movement of a stimulus during low visual stimulus contrast trials. When animals wiggle, the low visual stimulus contrast accuracy increases by 6.0% (Pearson correlation, r=0.900, p=0.038, N=5 group means computed from 213 mice). Moreover, mice wiggle the wheel at a speed that corresponds to a visual stimulus temporal frequency (11.52 {+/-} 2.45 Hz) demonstrated to maximize contrast sensitivity in a Go/No-Go task (Umino et al, 2018). These findings suggest that mice wiggle a wheel to boost the salience of low visual contrast stimuli.

">Stuck on you! Social brain stimulation increases the cognitive effort required to return to the egocentric perspective</a></h4>

              
                Flexible switching between self and other perspectives is critical for adaptive social cognition and is thought to rely on the dynamic regulation of self-other representations. Although neuroimaging implicates the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in perspective-taking, causal evidence for their specific contributions to perspective switching is lacking. Here, we applied focal transcranial direct current stimulation (f-tDCS) to the dmPFC and rTPJ while participants completed a visual perspective-taking task requiring switches between egocentric and altercentric viewpoints. Anodal stimulation to either site selectively increased the cognitive cost of switching back to the egocentric-perspective, without affecting switches into the altercentric-perspective. Rather than facilitating re-engagement with self-referential processing, stimulation enhanced altercentric persistence or impaired disengagement from the altercentric perspective. These findings provide novel causal evidence that both the dmPFC and rTPJ are involved in regulating the inhibition and updating of self-other representations during perspective switching. Results suggest that stimulation of these hubs may disrupt efficient realignment to the self, highlighting their role in maintaining an altercentric cognitive state. Future studies are required to uncover the precise neural computations that account for the comparable behavioural outcomes observed across distinct social brain hubs.

">Measuring partner synchrony during salsa dancing and its relationship to changes in psychosocial domains</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dance is a promising rehabilitation adjunct but understanding the mechanisms through which dance improves physical and psychosocial well-being is necessary for implementation. This study investigated the feasibility of a measure of one possible mechanism: partner synchrony. Secondary objectives were to examine the relationships between partner synchrony, instructor ratings, and changes in psychosocial variables. Methods: Participants wore an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor during a salsa class that was video recorded. Partner synchrony was quantified with correlations of x, y, and z-axis acceleration between dancing pairs. Psychosocial variables were measured pre- and post-class. Salsa instructors rated partner synchrony from video recordings. Feasibility parameters included percentage of participants with data collected and sensor comfort. Pre-post changes were analyzed with Wilcoxon ranked tests and relationships were analyzed with Spearman correlations. Results: Data was collected for 23/24 (96%) participants and 17/24 (81%) reported the sensor was comfortable. All psychosocial variables improved from pre- to post- class. Partner synchrony was significantly associated with instructor ratings and change in positive and negative affect. Conclusions: An IMU-based measure of dance partner synchrony is feasible, associated with ratings by dance instructors and related to changes in mood. The partner synchrony measure can be used to advance our understanding of dance as a therapeutic tool after its reliability is investigated.

">Vascular draining confounds laminar decoding in fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Laminar fMRI using GE-BOLD is vulnerable to spatial blurring from intracortical veins, while multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is often assumed to mitigate these biases. Yet, this assumption has not been systematically investigated. We thus developed a mechanistic laminar response model that simulates voxel-wise patterns across cortical depths, incorporating a vascular draining model. We conducted simulations in which the ground-truth signal originated in a single, several, or across all layers, and applied standard MVPA decoding before and after deconvolution of the draining effect. Decoding accuracies were consistently influenced by draining veins: deep-origin signals yielded above-chance decoding in superficial layers, and null scenarios produced false positives in middle or deep layers. Vascular deconvolution enhanced specificity in single-layer cases but did not resolve ambiguities in null decoding profiles. Simulating six thinner layers improved decoding accuracies, especially in the deconvolved signal scenarios. These findings demonstrate that multivariate techniques are not inherently immune to vascular biases, but also demonstrate that careful modeling can help correct draining effects.

">Variation in Synaptic Inputs Drives Functional Versatility for Sound Encoding in Globular Bushy Cells</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic convergence is fundamental to neuronal circuit function, enabling diverse processing such as coincidence detection and reliable signal transmission. In sensory systems, the architecture of convergence and strengths of synaptic inputs are pivotal for extracting distinct features of the sensory stimulus. In auditory system, globular bushy cells (GBC) in the cochlear nucleus receive multiple axosomatic endbulb of Held terminals from the auditory nerves, which vary considerably in size, even among inputs targeting the same cell. However, the functional consequences of this input strength variation for sound encoding remain unclear. Here, we investigated how synaptic input variation shapes sound encoding in GBC of Mongolian gerbils, using in vitro conductance-clamp recordings and computational modeling, in which synaptic inputs with varying strengths were simulated. We found that input variation critically shapes GBC sound encoding by influencing temporal precision and firing rates. Low input variation allows GBC to act as coincidence detectors, thereby improving temporal precision. Conversely, high input variation increases overall firing rates and enhances the encoding of amplitude modulations, albeit at the expense of temporal precision. These findings suggest that inherent endbulb strength heterogeneity allows GBC to operate along a functional continuum. This variation in input strength may provide the basis for generating diverse information streams to downstream targets including the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB).

">Nanophotonic neural probes for in vivo photostimulation, electrophysiology, and microfluidic delivery</a></h4>

              
                Implantable silicon neural probes with integrated optical emitters and electrodes are emerging tools for simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and electrophysiological recording in deep brain regions. In parallel, neural probes with microfluidic channels have been developed for localized drug delivery and neurochemical sampling. However, thus far, such fluidic probes have lacked optical and electrical functionalities or been limited to a low number of optical emitters and/or electrodes, constraining their utility in multimodal investigations of neural circuits. Here, we introduce foundry-fabricated silicon nanophotonic neural probes with monolithically integrated microfluidics. Each probe has 16 silicon nitride grating coupler emitters, 18 titanium nitride microelectrodes, and one embedded microfluidic channel. We evaluate the photonic, electrophysiological, and microfluidic functionalities in vivo in optogenetic, blue-light-sensitive mice. With our multifunctional neural probes, we demonstrate local suppression of epileptic seizure activity (induced by microfluidic injection of 4-aminopyridine) using photostimulation. Through foundry-compatible microfluidics integration, this work advances the versatility of nanophotonic neural probes and presents new possibilities for multimodal neuroscience experiments leveraging this scalable neurotechnology.

">Transdiagnostic symptomatology amidst real-world environmental uncertainty: a cross-sectional and cross-lagged panel network analysis</a></h4>

              
                Uncertainty is a potential driver of poor mental health outcomes, and uncertainty is mounting globally across many domains of daily life. However, it remains unclear how anxiety and depression symptoms emerge in response to uncertainty in these real-life contexts. Capitalising on the COVID-19 pandemic as a naturalistic experiment, we investigate how heightened real-world environmental uncertainty interacts with intolerance of uncertainty (IU) to drive mental health symptoms. We collected self-reported data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and IU from 301 participants for two time points. We performed cross-sectional network analyses to identify influential contributors and established a cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) to investigate longitudinal effects. Anxiety, depression and IU symptoms were higher when real-world uncertainty was higher (t2) compared to when it was lower (t1). Network analyses revealed the same three symptom clusters at both timepoints, however worry became more central to the network at t2. In the CLPN, unlike anxiety and depression symptoms, IU symptoms had the highest autoregressive values, meaning IU at t2 was well predicted by IU at t1. The item "inhibition of behaviour due to doubt" positively predicted both anxiety and anhedonia. This study highlights the relevance of worry during higher real-world uncertainty and the predictive value of predispositional IU. Our findings further suggest behavioural inhibition to be a potential target to alleviate internalising psychopathology. During ever-increasing fluctuations in global uncertainty, we provide novel insights into the temporal relationships of highly prevalent psychopathology, which might inform support strategies for people with existing mental health vulnerabilities.

">Slow-varying normalization explains auditory steady-state masking interactions in human EEG</a></h4>

              
                The inherent ability of sensory neurons to entrain to modulations in the temporal structure of an auditory stimulus gives rise to the auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Simultaneous presentation of multiple acoustic stimuli by frequency tagging them to generate ASSRs at different frequencies is routinely employed for hearing threshold determination and cognitive studies. However, the nature of ASSR interactions as a function of competing modulation frequencies in the absence of overt behaviour and the underlying neural mechanisms have not been well studied. Such interactions have previously been studied with visual stimuli that generate steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and explained using a normalization model. Here, we tested whether similar interactions are observed in the auditory domain, and if so, can be explained using a similar model. We played sinusoidally amplitude-modulated stimuli simultaneously modulated at two frequencies while we recorded a 64-channel EEG from subjects who passively listened to these sounds with closed eyes. We used multiple modulation frequencies and depths to characterize the ASSR modulation masking response profile. We observed that modulation frequencies closer to each other suppress the ASSR strongly than frequencies that are farther apart, similar to the interaction observed in the visual domain using SSVEPs. The observed suppression was captured by a slow-varying normalization model, which was initially used to explain SSVEP interactions. We obtained a band-pass shaped suppression profile with a low-pass cutoff that matched to that observed for SSVEP interactions. Our findings highlight the universality of the normalization model in accounting for masking interactions across modalities.

">Comparative snRNAseq study of C9orf72, SOD1, and sALS spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons, yet the cell-type specific molecular alterations within the spinal cords are not well characterized. In this study, we conducted deep molecular profiling of spinal cord tissues donated by people living with sporadic, C9orf72, and SOD1-ALS using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq). We observed numerous distinct gene expression patterns and enriched pathways among ALS types. However, when focusing on common features, we identified activation of stress-response and inflammatory pathways in specific microglia subtypes, as well as disrupted vesicle transport and synaptic function in a ventral inhibitory neuronal subtype. Notably, CPLX3, a SNARE regulator, was uniquely expressed in alpha-motor neurons and was commonly downregulated across all ALS types. While this study uncovers the molecular heterogeneity underlying ALS, it also highlights shared pathways within specific cell types, especially in the ventral inhibitory neurons that have been less explored in ALS research.

">Modified tau leads to neuronal and global ribosome dysfunction in C. elegans model of tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an early loss of memory formation which requires protein synthesis. Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein and is subject to extensive post-translational modifications (PTMs). Some PTMs have been shown to alter localization of tau and allow tau to disrupt protein translation. Protein interactome studies indicate that tau might interact with ribosomal proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that tau is causing ribosomal dysfunction as an early event and this interaction is dependent on tau's PTMs. To test this, we used a C. elegans strain expressing single copy insertion of human tau as well as two of the most frequent modified versions of tau in mechanosensory neurons. With our assay to measure translation, we showed that in our T231 phosphorylation mimetic strain, there was a significant decrease in neuronal translation. This mimetic strain also showed a significant decrease in median lifespan and locomotion. Unexpectedly, in all our Tau-expressing strains, we detected a significant decrease in whole worm translation, suggesting a possible role of tau to influence translation in other tissues in worm. Our in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo efforts to demonstrate tau-ribosome association via fluorescent polysome profiling have shown that there is no direct association between tau and the ribosome. Ribosome dysfunction caused by modified tau could be an early event in AD pathology before the pathological hallmarks appear.

">Song familiarity relies on evidence accumulation</a></h4>

              
                Familiarity judgements are thought to involve evidence accumulation, a decision-making process in which information is gathered over time until a threshold is reached. Previous work has identified a scalp-recorded signature of evidence accumulation called the central-parietal positivity (CPP). We built on this previous work and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants listened to several melodies, instructing participants to respond as soon as the song felt familiar. A prominent CPP was noted, time-locked to decisions. We then used linear regression to unmix overlapping neural responses and observed a stimulus-locked indicator of evidence accumulation that increased in amplitude just prior to a familiarity decision. This result suggests that song familiarity relies on evidence accumulation, with individual notes in a familiar song acting as "evidence".

">Helicobacter pylori infection and α-synuclein pathology drive parallel neurodegenerative pathways in the substantia nigra</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease related to both genetic and environmental insults. Epidemiological studies have linked Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection to Parkinson's disease risk, but the underlying mechanisms of this association remain unclear. In this study, we investigate whether chronic infection with a pathogenic H. pylori strain can induce -synuclein aggregation or neurodegeneration, and whether infection clearance mitigates these effects. We also assessed whether H. pylori infection exacerbates -synuclein pathology and neuron loss when combined with seeding of -synuclein pathology. We find that chronic H. pylori infection induces a sustained immune response in the gut and plasma that leads to mild brain inflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss, independent of -synuclein pathology. These effects are attenuated by eradication of the infection. In mice with -synuclein pathology induced by pre-formed fibrils, H. pylori did not further exacerbate the extent of pathology or neuronal death. Together, these results suggest that H. pylori infection can lead to neurodegeneration through inflammatory mechanisms independent of -synuclein aggregation. Our findings offer mechanistic insights into how pathogens influence the risk and progression of Parkinson's disease.

">Early Metabolic Alterations in Cerebrospinal Fluid Fatty Acid Profiles Linked to Cognitive Decline and All-Cause Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Background: While All-cause dementia (ACD) may often be characterized by the abnormal deposition of extracellular {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) in the brain cortex and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) as neurofibrillary tangles intracellularly, there is a need to identify early metabolic changes that may accompany these pathological changes. Objective: This study evaluated the predictive value of fatty acids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fractions in differentiating cognitively unimpaired (CU), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and ACD participants. Methods: CSF fatty acid profiles were analyzed from CU (n=68), MCI (n=38), and ACD (n=37) individuals aged 77.3 plus-or-minus sign 7.7 years, sourced from the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI). Multivariable binary logistic regression identified the most effective CSF fatty acid biomarkers for distinguishing CU, MCI, and ACD groups. The top-performing CSF fatty acid biomarkers were combined with A{beta}42, tau, and the A{beta}42/tau ratio to evaluate their collective diagnostic performance. The model was adjusted for covariates, including age, sex, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, and APOE genotype. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for the top 10 CSF fatty acids ranked by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, and their significance was assessed using the DeLong test. Results: The top 10 fatty acids in CSF fractions demonstrated superior discrimination between CU individuals and those with MCI compared to traditional markers such as A{beta}42, tau, and the A{beta}42/tau ratio. Furthermore, incorporating a panel of these fatty acid biomarkers alongside A{beta}42/tau significantly improved diagnostic accuracy. Age, sex, smoking, hypertension, APOE genotype, and diabetes did not significantly influence the model's performance. Conclusion: This study suggests that changes in fatty acid metabolism occur in the early stages of ACD pathology. Thus, strategies that regulate fatty acid metabolism may prevent cognitive decline in an older population.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The dorsal midline thalamus (DMT) is composed of the paraventricular (PV) and paratenial (PT) nuclei. While the anatomical and functional properties of PV are well-established, PT has remarkably received very little attention—even though the efferent projections of PV and PT are very similar. Using a combination of retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry, we examined the anatomical inputs to PT and compared them with those to the anterior and posterior PV and to the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In addition, we examined orexinergic and serotonergic afferents to the PT, comparing them with those to other thalamic nuclei. We found that PT and PV receive input from a common set of structures, including the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, septum, subiculum of the hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. However, the pattern and density of these various afferents to PT and PV significantly differed. For instance, PT received much stronger inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex, while PV received stronger projections from the subiculum of the hippocampus and more widespread input from the hypothalamus and the brainstem. By comparison, afferents to AD differed from PT (and PV), as AD received substantial input from the retrosplenial and anterior cingulate cortices, and uniquely from the lateral mammillary nucleus. Further, orexinergic (ORX) and serotonergic (5-HT) fibers distributed at best modestly to PT, which contrasted with quite dense ORX and 5-HT innervation of PV. The present findings, essentially representing the first comprehensive examination of afferent projections to PT, show that the inputs to PT mainly arise from limbic forebrain structures—with pronounced projections from the orbitofrontal cortex, nuclei of the diagonal band, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The functional properties of PT partially overlap with those of PV, but as described herein PT also participates in unique affective, cognitive, and motivational behaviors.</p>

<p>The multi-compartmental organization of spleen-projecting neurons—from the celiac ganglia to the spleen—complicates anatomical identification.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the crucial role played by the sympathetic spleen innervation in regulating immune cell function involving fighting pathogens or tissue injury. These findings have sparked interest across different research fields with a common goal of understanding and manipulating splenic sympathetic activity to modulate immune function and inflammation. However, the anatomical identification of spleen-projecting neurons in rodents presents a considerable challenge, given the multi-compartmentalized location of their cellular components.</p>
<p>This article addresses this challenge by providing a detailed anatomical dissection guide of the mouse celiac ganglion and splenic nerve, harboring the cell body and projecting axons, respectively. By combining antero- and retrograde neuronal tracing, immunofluorescence, 3D reconstruction, and viral tracing techniques, we validate the connectivity between the celiac ganglion and the spleen and provide insights into their microanatomy. Importantly, we demonstrate the feasibility of viral transduction in these neurons. Additionally, we identified nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) within the splenic nerve and demonstrated their responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Our findings offer a comprehensive anatomical framework for studying spleen-projecting neurons, paving the way for future investigations into their role in immune regulation and inflammation, as well as their manipulation using advanced neurobiological tools.</p>

Bone health is a growing concern in aging populations, and bioactive peptides in dairy products offer a promising approach to preventing bone-related diseases. However, the lack of a public database for osteogenic peptides (OPs) has limited the computational detection efforts. In this work, we introduce OP-AND, a curated public database of osteogenic peptides. We also propose a novel hypothesis that peptides derived from proteins involved in osteoclast formation may serve as non-osteogenic. Considering the limited availability of OP data, we present SimPep, a deep learning framework that achieves 86.87% accuracy and 76.88% area under receiver-operating characteristic curve score using 5-fold cross-validation. SimPep’s performance is further evaluated on external datasets, and a pipeline is introduced to select potential OPs for experimental studies. The camel milk alpha s1-casein peptide ‘MKLLILTCLVAVALARPKYPLRYPEVF’ is highlighted as a top candidate for future exploration. The OP-AND database is available in https://github.com/CBRC-lab/SimPep_and_OP-AND.

R-loops are transient three-stranded nucleic acids that form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA, freeing the non-template strand of the DNA. There is growing evidence that R-loops play important roles in physiological processes such as the regulation of gene expression, and that they contribute to chromosomal instability and disease. It is known that R-loop formation is influenced by both the sequence and the topology of the DNA substrate, but many questions remain about how R-loops form and the three-dimensional structures that they adopt. Here we represent an R-loop as a word in a formal grammar, the <i>R-loop grammar</i>. We use the R-loop grammar to predict R-loop formation. We train the R-loop grammar on experimental data obtained by single-molecule R-loop footprinting and sequencing (SMRF-seq). Despite not explicitly encoding topological information, the R-loop grammar accurately predicts R-loop formation on plasmids with varying starting topologies and outperforms previous methods in R-loop prediction.

Data from cell viability assays, which measure cumulative division and death events in a population and reflect substantial cellular heterogeneity, are widely available. However, interpreting such data with mechanistic computational models is hindered because direct model/data comparison is often muddled. We developed an algorithm that tracks simulated division and death events in mechanistically-detailed single-cell lineages to enable such a model/data comparison and suggest causes of cell-cell drug response variability. Using our previously developed model of mammalian single-cell proliferation and death signaling, we simulated drug dose response experiments for four targeted anti-cancer drugs (alpelisib, neratinib, trametinib and palbociclib) and compared them to experimental data. Simulations are consistent with data for strong growth inhibition by trametinib (MEK inhibitor) and overall lack of efficacy for alpelisib (PI-3K inhibitor), but are inconsistent with data for palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and neratinib (EGFR inhibitor). Model/data inconsistencies suggest that (i) the importance of CDK4/6 for driving the cell cycle may be overestimated, and (ii) the cellular balance between basal (tonic) and ligand-induced signaling is a critical determinant of receptor inhibitor response. Simulations show subpopulations of rapidly and slowly dividing cells in both control and drug-treated conditions. Variations in mother cells prior to drug treatment impinging on ERK pathway activity are associated with the rapidly dividing phenotype and trametinib resistance. This work lays a foundation for the application of mechanistic modeling to large-scale cell viability datasets and better understanding determinants of cellular heterogeneity in drug response.

                <p>by Francesca Soncin</p>

The placenta is one of the most diverse organs among eutherian mammals, and comparative placentation studies can reveal fundamental processes that support a successful pregnancy. A new study in PLOS Biology uses swine placental organoids and in vivo spatial transcriptomics to uncover key insights into placental cell diversity and evolution.

More work is needed to characterize the evolutionary diversity of placental development in eutherian mammals. This Primer discusses a recent PLOS Biology study that provides a rich spatial transcriptomic characterization of the porcine placenta and develops a new swine trophoblast organoid model

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a highly variable, multisystemic genetic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of <i>DMPK.</i> Toxicity is exerted by repeat-containing <i>DMPK</i> transcripts that sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and lead to deleterious yet predictable changes in alternative splicing. To contend with high phenotypic and molecular variability that complicate application of viral-based therapies, we develop and test a DM1-responsive genetic element to control viral-based therapeutic output.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MBNL-dependent cassette exons to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV)-compatible control elements (DMX<sup>on</sup>). Minigenes were tested in vitro using a Dox-inducible MBNL1 cell model and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DM1 myotubes and in vivo using DM1 model mice following intramuscular and systemic AAV injection. DMX<sup>on</sup> splicing, correction of endogenous splicing or skeletal muscle myotonia, and prevention of cardiac toxicity associated with therapeutic MBNL1 overexpression were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> cassettes respond to MBNL1 dose or expression of CUG repeat RNA. DMX<sup>on</sup> controlled expression of therapeutic MBNL1 protein can improve skeletal muscle myotonia or prevent cardiac toxicity due to MBNL1 overexpression in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMX<sup>on</sup> control elements can increase the therapeutic window of viral-based therapeutics in DM1, and activity is dependent upon delivered cargo and model severity. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Mechanotransduction is essential for complex cellular behaviors such as muscle contraction and hearing sensation. RNA processing is a molecular mechanism that regulates gene expression. Bais and Giudice review the recently growing body of research showing that mechanotransduction and RNA processing work together to modulate cell adaptations to mechanical forces.

                PI5P4Kα is a critical metabolic gatekeeper in PDAC, promoting glucose and iron acquisition to support tumor survival. Arora et al. demonstrate that PI5P4Kα suppression disrupts the metabolic flexibility of PDAC cells, leading to apoptotic cell death, revealing a highly actionable therapeutic vulnerability.

                Suzuki et al. demonstrate that mosquito salivary gland extracts enhance flavivirus pathogenicity through TLR2-mediated recruitment of immune cells. These findings suggest that TLR2 contributes to early immune modulation at the infection site and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102681">The long noncoding RNA lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically restricts RAS signaling in human papillomavirus type 16-infected cervical cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Increased expression of lnc-FANCI-2, a newly discovered long noncoding RNA, is associated with cervical lesion progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 1 (CIN1, low grade), CIN2–3 (high grade), to cervical cancer. Viral oncoprotein E7 of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) and host transcription factor YY1 are two major factors promoting lnc-FANCI-2 expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we knocked out the expression of <i>lnc-FANCI-2</i> in the HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line, CaSki cells. The selected knockout (KO) single-cell clones displayed altered cell morphology and proliferation with changes of cellular soluble receptors, but normal HPV16 E6 and E7 expression. Relative to the parental cells, lnc-FANCI-2 KO cells exhibited significantly increased RAS signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, but decreased response to IFN signaling, along with increased p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 (two RAS signaling effectors), IGFBP3, MCAM, VIM, and CCND2 (cyclin D2) and decreased expression of RAC3. lnc-FANCI-2 in CaSki interacts with cellular proteins H13, HNRH1, K1H1, MAP4K4, and RNPS1. MAP4K4 knockdown led to enhance the expression of p-Erk1/2 and p-Akt. High lnc-FANCI-2 and low MCAM levels in cervical cancer tissues were found to be associated with patients’ survival. A key function of lnc-FANCI-2 intrinsically regulates RAS signaling to impact cervical lesion progression and cervical cancer prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105471">Thrifty wide-context models of B cell receptor somatic hypermutation</a></h4>

              
                Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the diversity-generating process in antibody affinity maturation. Probabilistic models of SHM are needed for analyzing rare mutations, understanding the selective forces guiding affinity maturation, and understanding the underlying biochemical process. High-throughput data offers the potential to develop and fit models of SHM on relevant data sets. In this article, we model SHM using modern frameworks. We are motivated by recent work suggesting the importance of a wider context for SHM; however, assigning an independent rate to each k-mer leads to an exponential proliferation of parameters. Thus, using convolutions on 3-mer embeddings, we develop ‘thrifty’ models of SHM of various sizes; these can have fewer free parameters than a 5-mer model and yet have a significantly wider context. These offer a slight performance improvement over a 5-mer model, and other modern model elaborations worsen performance. We also find that a per-site effect is not necessary to explain SHM patterns given nucleotide context. Also, the two current methods for fitting an SHM model—on out-of-frame sequence data and on synonymous mutations—produce significantly different results, and augmenting out-of-frame data with synonymous mutations does not aid out-of-sample performance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105978">Cap-independent co-expression of dsRNA-sensing and NF-κB pathway inhibitors enables controllable self-amplifying RNA expression with reduced immunotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) holds promise for durable therapeutic gene expression, but its broader utility beyond vaccines is limited by potent innate immune responses triggered during replication. These responses shut down translation, induce cytotoxicity, degrade host mRNAs, and drive cytokine production. While exogenous immunosuppressants can blunt these effects, they complicate treatment and risk systemic side effects. To address this, we engineered ‘immune-evasive saRNA’ that intrinsically suppresses the innate immune pathways triggered by its own replication. This strategy leverages cap-independent translation to co-express a suite of inhibitors from a single saRNA transcript, targeting key innate immune pathways, including protein kinase R (PKR), oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In primary mouse fibroblast-like synoviocytes, a cell type central to the pathology of joint diseases, immune-evasive saRNA enables sustained transgene expression without external immunosuppressants, substantially reducing cytotoxicity and antiviral cytokine secretion. Crucially, this system offers both concentration-dependent control of expression and on-demand termination via a small-molecule antiviral. Together, these findings establish a framework for developing saRNA therapeutics with an improved tolerability profile that can be switched off once therapeutic outcomes are met, offering a path toward a controllable gene expression platform that fills the therapeutic gap between the transience of mRNA and the permanence of viral vectors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100257">Identifying in vivo genetic dependencies of melanocyte and melanoma development</a></h4>

              
                The advent of large-scale sequencing in both development and disease has identified large numbers of candidate genes that may be linked to important phenotypes. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked in to the endogenous <i>mitfa</i> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that in vitro screens can mask in vivo phenotypes. Our genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104355">Multi-omics investigation of spontaneous T2DM macaque emphasizes gut microbiota could up-regulate the absorption of excess palmitic acid in the T2DM progression</a></h4>

              
                Although gut microbiota and lipid metabolites have been suggested to be closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the interactions between gut microbiota, lipid metabolites, and the host in T2DM development remains unclear. Rhesus macaques may be the best animal model to investigate these relationships given their spontaneous development of T2DM. We identified eight spontaneous T2DM macaques and conducted a comprehensive study investigating the relationships using multi-omics sequencing technology. Our results from 16 S rRNA, metagenome, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses identified that gut microbiota imbalance, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid β oxidation disorders, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) accumulation, and inflammation occurred in T2DM macaques. We verified the accumulation of palmitic acid (PA) and activation of inflammation in T2DM macaques. Importantly, mice transplanted with spontaneous T2DM macaque fecal microbiota and fed a high PA diet developed prediabetes within 120 days. We determined that gut microbiota mediated the absorption of excess PA in the ileum, resulting in the accumulation of PA in the serum, consequently leading to T2DM in mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the specific microbiota composition was probably involved in the process. This study provides new insight into interactions between microbiota and metabolites and confirms causative effect of gut microbiota on T2DM development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98666">Mesolimbic dopamine ramps reflect environmental timescales</a></h4>

              
                Mesolimbic dopamine activity occasionally exhibits ramping dynamics, reigniting debate on theories of dopamine signaling. This debate is ongoing partly because the experimental conditions under which dopamine ramps emerge remain poorly understood. Here, we show that during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning in mice, mesolimbic dopamine ramps are only observed when the inter-trial interval is short relative to the trial period. These results constrain theories of dopamine signaling and identify a critical variable determining the emergence of dopamine ramps.

                Numerous studies have shown that viral variants that elude the host immune response may incur a fitness expense, diminishing the survival of the viral strain within the host, and the capacity of the variant to survive future transmission events. This definition can be divided into intrinsic fitness—fitness without immune pressure—and effective fitness, which includes immune influence. Co-occurring mutations outside immune-targeted epitope regions may also affect variant survival (epistasis). Analysis of viral fitness and epistasis over the non-structural protein regions is lacking for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Using a rare cohort of subjects recently infected with HCV, we build on prior work by integrating mathematical modeling and experimental data to examine the interplay between transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses, immune responses, fitness, and co-occurring mutations. We show that viral fitness declines during the first 90 days post-infection (DPI), associated with the magnitude of CD8 +T cell responses and early diversification. Fitness then rebounds in a complex pattern marked by co-occurring mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that an early, strong CD8 +T cell response in the absence of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) exerts strong selective pressure, allowing escape and chronic infection. These insights support HCV vaccine strategies that elicit broad T and B cell immunity.

">CEREBRAL GLUCOSE UTILISATION DURING MUSICAL EMOTIONS: A MULTIMODAL FUNCTIONAL PET/MRI STUDY.</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated music-induced activation of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across brain networks associated with auditory perception, motor control, and emotion. However, BOLD-fMRI reflects vascular responses that may not fully capture underlying neural activity. Here, we used simultaneous [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) functional positron emission tomography (fPET) and fMRI to examine glucose metabolism closely linked to neural activity, alongside hemodynamic responses during pleasurable music listening. Thirty-five female participants listened to self-selected pleasurable music and control stimuli while undergoing 90-minute PET-MRI scans. fPET revealed music-evoked increase in glucose consumption in auditory and motor cortices, as well as reward-related regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), caudate, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The fPET and fMRI results showed substantial overlap though some discrepancies were also observed. Notably, the NAcc exhibited increased glucose consumption in fPET but showed no activation in fMRI. Conversely, deactivation of the default mode network during music processing was only observed with fMRI. These results highlight the complementary nature of neurometabolic and neurovascular processes and offer novel insights into their dynamics during the processing of aesthetic rewards.

">Stable clique membership in mouse societies requires oxytocin-enabled social sensory states</a></h4>

              
                The ability to form stable de novo relationships in complex environments is essential for social functioning and is impaired in severe psychiatric disorders including autism. Yet, the neurobiological basis and cognitive processes enabling the formation of stable bonds in larger groups remain poorly understood, thereby limiting our ability to develop effective therapies. Here, we establish a semi-naturalistic model of clique formation in mouse societies, where individuals are tracked longitudinally from massive video data. Small, stable rich-clubs develop within these mouse social networks. Consistent with human rich-clubs, these cohesive cliques tended to have high social rank and exerted influence on non-members. Interestingly, neither prior rich-club-membership in a different group nor kinship facilitated entry into rich-clubs. Mimicking sparse population genetics, we probed the open question whether a subtle neuro-cognitive phenotype, namely impaired induction of social sensory processing states by cortical oxytocin signaling, disrupts higher-order social bonding in these complex social environments. Despite preserved social motivation, mice with alterations in this oxytocin subsystem failed to join rich-clubs. They approached group members less consistently, and connections from others towards them fluctuated more as well. This reciprocal disorganization highlights how interactional dynamics within social networks can amplify individual-level deficits, consistent with models of emergent properties of social behavior. These findings underscore the role of oxytocin in tuning sensory systems into a social processing state. Its dysfunction affects an individual's ability to establish stable relationships in complex social networks, with profound implications for social functioning deficits in psychiatric disorders.

">Striatal visual responses increase prior to visuomotor learning</a></h4>

              
                The cortex and basal ganglia exhibit interdependent changes during learning. However, it is not clear whether plasticity occurs in sequence or concurrently across these structures. To address this question, we simultaneously recorded cortical and striatal activity while training mice on a visuomotor association task, which involved turning a wheel to move a stimulus from a cue location to a target location. Prior to the development of learned behavior, visual responses increased in the visual-recipient striatum. This was followed by the emergence of stimulus responses in both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-recipient striatum from the onset of learned behavior. All of these regions also exhibited increased responses to stimuli in the rewarded target position, but while the visual-recipient striatum was non-selective between cue and target stimuli, the mPFC and mPFC-recipient striatum switched from being target-stimulus responsive before learning to being cue-stimulus responsive after learning. Our results suggest that sensorimotor learning involves routing stimulus information first to the sensory striatum, and then to frontal motor circuits.

">Hierarchical coding of local and global positions in episodic memory for naturalistic sequences</a></h4>

              
                Life unfolds continuously across multiple timescales, yet how the brain encodes hierarchical event sequences remains poorly understood. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the neural coding of hierarchical positions in naturalistic sequence memory. Participants viewed video sequences with a nested structure and later recalled their serial order. Behavioral analyses revealed transposition errors for items occupying identical global or local position. Multivariate classification and subspace analyses revealed separable neural representations of global and local positions. Local positions were better decoded in high-dimensional space, whereas global positions exhibited greater pattern separability in low-dimensional space. Brain regions encoding global positions exhibited longer neural timescales and reduced sensitivity to low-level event transitions compared to regions encoding local positions. These findings support a parallel hierarchical organization of content and context, a novel framework that enables integration of item and order across hierarchical levels and provides principles for hierarchical representations in both human memory and artificial intelligence.

">Higher baseline alpha power is associated with faster responses in visual search</a></h4>

              
                Visual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritized for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Neuronal alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) have been associated with functional inhibition of cortical excitability, as well as distractor suppression in spatial attention and visual working memory tasks. We therefore hypothesised that alpha oscillations similarly support the deselection of distractors in visual search. Using Magnetoencephalography (MEG), we here show that high alpha power before the onset of a complex search display is associated with faster search performance. Crucially, we used a General Linear Model (GLM) approach to control for confounds between alpha power and task duration, ruling out that this result was merely driven by practice effects paired with increased fatigue over time. In addition to spontaneous oscillatory activity, we quantified the cortical excitability to colours of the search stimuli based on Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) responses. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, increased pre-search alpha power did not correlate with the RIFT response, providing no direct evidence for feature-specific inhibition of distracting stimuli by alpha. Our findings challenge the traditional view of alpha oscillations reducing visual processing, showing instead that increased occipital alpha power can enhance performance in a visual task. We propose that the increase in alpha power may reflect increased top-down control supporting visual search

">Selective changes in cortical cholinergic signaling during learning</a></h4>

              
                Cognition relies on the function of local and long-range neural circuits in the neocortex, which are dynamically regulated by neuromodulatory signals including acetylcholine (ACh). Recent work suggests that the role of acetylcholine varies across cortical areas and behavioral states. In addition, the precise role of cholinergic signaling during learning and plasticity remains unclear. We performed simultaneous, dual-color mesoscopic imaging of ACh and calcium signaling in the neocortex of awake mice across multiple stages of visual task learning to identify learning-related plasticity in neural activity and cholinergic signaling. Using a novel Pattern Reconstruction and Interpretation with a Structured Multimodal transformer (PRISMT) model combining masked autoencoding with multimodal causal attention, we identified key cortical regions that reorganize with learning. We found that cholinergic signaling exhibited spatiotemporally selective plasticity in frontal cortical subnetworks during visual perceptual learning. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of transformer models for generating biologically interpretable insight into large multimodal datasets and link long-term functional reorganization of cortical networks to enhanced task performance.

">Endocytome profiling uncovers cell-surface protein dynamics underlying neuronal connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Endocytosis actively remodels the neuronal surface proteome to drive diverse cellular processes, yet its global extent and circuit-level consequences have defied comprehensive interrogation. Here, we introduce endocytome profiling: a systematic, cell-type-specific approach for mapping cell-surface protein (CSP) dynamics in situ. Quantitative proteomic analysis of developing olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons generated an endocytic atlas comprising over 1,100 proteins and revealed the extent to which the surface proteome is remodeled to meet distinct developmental demands. Targeted interrogation of a junctional CSP showed that its endosome-to-surface ratio is precisely balanced to enable developmental axon pruning while preserving mature axon integrity. Multi-omic integration uncovered wide-spread transcellular signaling and identified a growth factor secreted by neighboring neurons to direct ORN axon targeting via endocytic regulation of its receptor. Endocytome profiling thus provides unprecedented access to cell-surface proteome dynamics and offers a powerful platform for dissecting proteome remodeling across diverse cell types and contexts.

">The Neuronal Primary Cilium is a Key Regulator of Homeostatic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The capacity of neurons to maintain stable activity levels through homeostatic plasticity is essential for proper brain function. Primary cilia, which are non-motile, antenna-like organelles projecting from the surface of most vertebrate cells, serve as key hubs for signal transduction, playing crucial roles in tissue development and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized role for primary cilia in mediating neuronal homeostatic plasticity using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. We show that neuronal cilia exhibit dynamic, bidirectional changes in volume in response to alterations in network activity: elongating during chronic activity suppression and shortening after increased activity. To assess the functional relevance of this ciliary plasticity, we modelled ciliary dysfunction in neurons carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes associated with neuronal ciliopathies, including NPHP1 and CEP290. Mutations affecting ciliary function either increased ciliary length or led to ciliary loss, and these mutant neurons exhibited severe impairments in homeostatic regulation across multiple domains -morphological, functional, and transcriptional. Specifically, NPHP1 and CEP290 deficient neurons failed to adapt synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability, and ciliary morphology in response to prolonged activity suppression. They also displayed dysregulated baseline network activity, and exhibited blunted gene expression changes. Together, these findings establish the primary cilium as a critical regulator of homeostatic plasticity in human neurons and provide a new framework through which to examine neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders linked to ciliary dysfunction.

                Probe-based in situ hybridization spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a state-of-the-art for neuroscience research. Accurate segmentation of neurons and non-neuronal cells, a critical step for downstream analysis, remains a big challenge. Using human sensory ganglia neurons as an example, we systematically explore this problem. We evaluated multiple automatic segmentation approaches using quantitative performance metrics and downstream results. We show that careful parameter tuning is essential for achieving accurate segmentation; however, even with optimized parameters, different models still yield distinct classes of errors. To mitigate these errors, we propose a manual quality check, which can validate and refine automated segmentation results. As a future direction, integrating multi-modal imaging data with tailored neural networks may further improve segmentation accuracy. In summary, our results argue that each automated segmentation method has distinct strengths, weaknesses, and characteristic error patterns; and that a manual review is necessary.

                After a blood meal, female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes suppress host-seeking while converting ingested nutrients into yolk protein for egg development. Neuropeptide Y-like Receptor 7 (NPYLR7) is required for this behavioral switch, but its physiological role and sites of action were unknown. We identify a specialized, non- neuronal population of npylr7-expressing cells in the rectal pads of the mosquito hindgut. While this tissue is associated with fluid and ion balance, npylr7 mutants maintain fluid regulation but show impaired oocyte provisioning. These cells display neuroendocrine features, including calcium responses to the NPYLR7 ligand RYamide and amino acids, as well as expression of neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicle release machinery. Vesicle recruitment occurs in these cells post-blood meal in wild-type, but not npylr7 mutants. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for NPYLR7 in a rectal cell population senses nutritional cues and communicates with the nervous system to regulate reproductive physiology, paralleling gut-brain circuits in mammals.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>High Gamma Band (HGB) and Slow Wave Oscillations (SWOs) have been identified as significant features in movement neurophysiology. HGB reflects local neuronal activity, while SWOs inform on the temporal characteristics of movement, especially during repetitive tasks. However, to date, they have mostly been studied separately, leaving details on their interaction largely unknown. Here, we looked at Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) to assess interactions between SWO phase and HGB power. We use a publicly-available electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during repetitive motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of hand and tongue movements. We found channels with significant SWO-HGB PAC for all subjects and tasks, distributed across multiple brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex PAC occurred at specific coupling phases and was primarily observed during ME, while frontal and temporal regions exhibited similar PAC levels across ME and MI but lacked distinct preferred coupling phases. When training decoders for movement detection, PAC underperformed compared to SWOs or HGB; however, it showed a strong correlation with accuracy when single-channel SWOs were used as decoding feature, highlighting its potential for channel selection. Weaker correlations were found when PAC was compared to task-related HGB power increases, suggesting that these represent distinct neural features.</span>

                <p>Cortical tracking of the speech envelope is an emerging, noninvasive measure of neurophysiological processing of speech that is being widely adopted. It demonstrates good ecological validity, as it allows researchers to study human processing of continuous, naturalistic speech containing dynamic spectrotemporal variations and rich linguistic content. While measures of cortical tracking have strong clinical and research applications, there is a lack of research documenting the reliability of these measures, including how they are affected by the stimulus and how the stimulus is represented, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and analysis parameters. In this study, we measured the test&ndash;retest reliability of cortical tracking of the speech envelope across different stimuli (an audiobook vs a podcast), stimulus features (broadband envelope and its derivative, multiband envelope and its derivative), reference electrodes (average mastoid vs common average reference), and EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, full) in 26 neurotypical adults (20 female) to assess the potential for cortical tracking to serve as a reliable measure of speech processing. We also examined the amount of data required to achieve stable reliability estimates. We observed moderate to good test&ndash;retest reliability for most parameters with as little as 390&nbsp;s of data, supporting the utility of cortical tracking of the speech envelope as a reliable tool for assessing speech processing. The findings of this study will allow researchers to more effectively design and implement studies on cortical tracking in neurotypical adults and adults with language disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is a vital physiological phenomenon observed among almost all organisms. Although its exact purpose remains elusive, sleep has been linked to memory consolidation. In our present study, we investigated the role of sleep quality on sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Previous studies have shown that <I>tequila</I>, a serine protease, affects long-term memory (LTM) consolidation in flies. In the present study, we identified that the hypomorphic mutation in the <I>tequila</I> gene (<I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I>) leads to increased daytime sleep fragmentation at a very early age in male flies. Intrigued by this observation, we delved into further understanding the role of <I>tequila</I> in sleep-dependent memory consolidation by manipulating sleep duration using pharmacological methods such as GABA-A agonist. Inducing sleep using GABA-A agonist resulted in improved sleep during the day. This further led to a significant improvement in the LTM of these flies when compared with the vehicle-treated flies. In conclusion, daytime-dependent sleep fragmentation is possibly one of the reasons behind the LTM deficit observed in <I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I> flies. Furthermore, we observed that these flies had disturbed sleep only during the daytime, whereas in the night the flies had increased sleep duration. The increased sleep fragmentation during the daytime possibly leads to memory impairment and rescuing sleep fragmentation partially rescues memory consolidation. These outcomes suggest that the <I>tequila</I> gene is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

Understanding animal movements at different spatial scales presents a significant challenge as their patterns can vary widely from daily foraging behaviours to broader migration or territorial movements. This challenge is of general interest because it impacts the ability to manage wildlife populations effectively. In this study, we conduct diffusion analysis based on European badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) movement data obtained from three different regions in the UK (Gloucestershire, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland) and fit a generalised linear mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between variables. We also feature a novel application of <i>extended dynamic mode decomposition</i> (EDMD) to uncover patterns relating to badger social organisation. By applying our approach to these different populations, we were able to assess its performance across a range of badger densities. A key result was that in some areas, EDMD clusters matched observed group home ranges, whilst in others, discrepancies likely arose because of population management interventions, such as badger culling. The methods presented offer a promising approach for studying territoriality and the impacts of management strategies on animal movement behaviour.

                <p>by Daiki Wakita, Satoshi Yamaji, Daiki Umetsu, Takeshi Kano</p>

Collective cell behavior is fundamental to structure multicellular organisms. There, constituting cells always have heterogeneous properties across cell types (macro-heterogeneity) and within a cell type (micro-heterogeneity). Many studies have described the existence of heterogeneity in various systems at the cellular level, whereas little has investigated its effect on the systems. Unveiling how heterogeneity plays a role in the collective behavior would build a bridge from microscopic to macroscopic biological phenomena. We use the muscle remodeling in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system, in which drastic reconstruction processes involve the physical interactions of various cells. At the early pupal stages, hundreds of hemocytes vigorously migrate and decompose the larval muscles into fragments called sarcolytes. We used in vivo and in silico approaches to understand how the dynamics of the sarcolyte population are characterized by hemocytes and other cells in the environment. Our in vivo imaging showed that the sarcolyte population gradually reduced the speed while changing the spatial arrangements. We also found that the sarcolyte dynamics involve macro-heterogeneity, namely, the coexistence of fat body cells and hemocytes, as well as micro-heterogeneity within hemocytes. To computationally evaluate the effects of factors determining the speed and arrangement of the sarcolyte population, we built a mathematical model assuming simplified interactions between sarcolytes, hemocytes, and fat body cells. Our simulations showed that, firstly, the efficient spreading and stable pattern formation of sarcolytes were together achieved by a delayed emergence of fat body cells and the micro-heterogeneity in hemocyte motility. Secondly, based on the similarity of observed and simulated network-like arrangements of sarcolytes, spatial confinement was another factor that causes the stabilization of sarcolytes. This study provides a pattern formation mechanism by which macro- and micro-heterogeneous migratory cells generate a ‘dual-purpose’ collective behavior—quickly spreading particles throughout the field while efficiently organizing them into an orderly arrangement.

Apoptosis has been reported to drive regeneration in many species. Executioner caspases, the key effectors in apoptosis, are responsible for production and secretion of various pro-regenerative signals from apoptotic cells to the surrounding cells. However, whether executioner caspase activation (ECA) can promote regeneration without inducing apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, by generating transgenic mice carrying a lineage tracing system for cells that have experienced ECA, we demonstrate that ECA occurs in a few hepatocytes in homeostatic livers. The fraction of hepatocytes with ECA dramatically expands during regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) treatment. Interestingly, rather than undergoing apoptosis, the majority of hepatocytes with ECA survive and proliferate during liver regeneration. Inhibition of ECA in livers results in reduced hepatocyte proliferation and impaired regeneration, whereas increasing ECA to a level sufficient to kill hepatocytes also impedes regeneration, suggesting that ECA needs to be precisely controlled at a sublethal level. Mechanistically, we show that ECA promotes hepatocyte proliferation through enhancing JAK/STAT3 activity. Our work reveals an essential apoptosis-independent role of executioner caspases in liver regeneration.

Ratios between two metabolites are sensitive indicators of metabolic changes. Lipidomic profiling studies have revealed that plasma ether lipids, a class of glycero- and glycerophospho-lipids with reported health benefits, are negatively associated with obesity. Here, we utilized lipid ratios as surrogate markers of lipid metabolism to explore the processes underlying the inverse relationship between ether lipid metabolism and obesity. Plasma lipidomics data from two independent human cohorts (<i>n</i> = 10,339 and <i>n</i> = 4,492) were integrated to assess the associations between 82 lipid ratios and obesity-related markers in males and females. Results were externally validated using mouse transcriptomics data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (<i>n</i> = 152−227 across 74 strains). Genome-wide association studies using imputed genotypes from a population cohort (<i>n</i> = 4,492) were performed to examine the genetic architecture of the ratios. Findings showed that waist circumference (WC), body mass index, and waist–hip ratio were inversely associated with total plasmalogens relative to total phospholipids in both sexes. Ratios comprising product–substrate pairs positioned either side of enzymes involved in plasmalogen synthesis and degradation showed positive and negative associations with WC, respectively. Branched-chain fatty acids negatively correlated with WC, while omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited differing associations depending on their position within the pathway. Mouse transcriptomics corroborated these results. Genomics data showed strong associations between ratios containing choline-plasmalogens and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transmembrane protein 229B (<i>TMEM229B</i>) gene region. This work demonstrates the utility of lipid ratios in understanding lipid metabolism. By applying the ratios to multi-omic datasets, we identified alterations in enzymatic activity and genetic variants likely affecting ether lipid synthesis in obesity that could not have been obtained from lipidomics data alone. Additionally, we characterized a potential role for <i>TMEM229B</i>, offering new perspectives on ether lipid metabolism and regulation.

The placenta is a dynamic, embryo-derived organ essential for fetal growth and development. While all eutherian mammals have placentas composed of fetal-derived trophoblasts that mediate maternal–fetal exchange, their anatomical and histological structures vary across species due to evolutionary divergence. Despite the cellular heterogeneity of porcine trophoblasts in vivo, understanding the mechanisms driving porcine placental development has been limited by the lack of in vitro models replicating this heterogeneity. In this study, we derived swine trophoblast organoids (sTOs) from full-term porcine placentas, retaining key transcriptional signatures of in vivo trophoblasts. To identify conserved cell populations, we integrated Visium spatial transcriptomics from mid-gestation porcine placentas with single-cell transcriptomics from sTOs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed novel markers of the porcine uterus and placenta, enabling precise separation of histological structures at the maternal–fetal interface. The integration of tissue and sTO transcriptomics showed that sTOs spontaneously differentiate into distinct trophoblast populations, with conserved gene expression and cell communication programs. These findings demonstrate that sTOs recapitulate porcine placental trophoblast populations, offering a powerful model for advancing placentation research. Our work also provides a spatially resolved whole-transcriptome dataset of the porcine maternal–fetal interface, opening new avenues for discoveries in placental development, evolution, and health across mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cortical malformations, including microgyria, are often associated with neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as epilepsy and cognitive impairments in humans. To investigate how early cortical disruption leads to persistent behavioral impairments, we employed a neonatal neocortical focal freeze lesion (FFL) model of polymicrogyria in male Wistar rats. Unilateral cortical lesions were induced at postnatal day 0 (P0), and molecular changes in hippocampal gene expression (glutamatergic signaling: <i>Grin1</i>, <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Grin2b</i>, <i>Gria1</i>, <i>Gria2</i>; neuroinflammation: <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>; glial markers: <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>; neurotrophic factors: <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>) were analyzed at P21. Behavioral outcomes, including locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and recognition memory, were assessed in adulthood (P70–P90). Neonatal cortical lesions induced subregion-specific alterations in hippocampal gene expression: <i>Grin2b</i> and <i>Gria1</i> expression decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus, while <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> increased in the contralateral ventral hippocampus. These molecular changes were associated with subsequent cognitive deficits (impaired recognition memory) and emotional dysregulation (heightened anxiety-like behavior) in adult rats, alongside reduced exploratory activity. Basic motor functions and sociability remained unaffected, and seizure susceptibility (assessed via maximal electroshock threshold) was unchanged, highlighting the specificity of the observed impairments. Our findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between early-life cortical malformations with microgyrus formation, dysregulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, and persistent neurobehavioral deficits. These results underscore the translational relevance of the freeze lesion model for studying the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cortical malformation-related comorbidities.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are finding use in real-world neurological settings. Whereas part 1 of this 3-part review series focused on the birth of AI and its foundational principles, this part 2 review shifts gears to explore more practical aspects of neurological care. The review details how large language models, generative AI, and robotics are supporting diagnostic accuracy, patient interaction, and treatment personalization. Special attention is given to ethical and philosophical facets of AI that nonetheless impact practical aspects of care and patient safety, such as accountability for AI-driven decisions and the “black box” nature of many algorithms. We will discuss whether AI systems can develop sentience, and the implications for human-AI collaboration. By examining human-robot interactions in neurology, this part 2 review highlights the profound impact AI could have on patient care and, as covered in the ensuing part 3, on global health care delivery and data analytics, while maintaining ethical oversight and human control.

<p>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) represent over 200 clinically heterogeneous genetic conditions involving degeneration of the cerebellum and associated tracts with resultant impairment of balance and coordination. Advancements in genomic testing have enabled rapid identification of the majority of known recessive disorders, shifting research focus to the development of targeted mechanistic treatments addressing underlying physiological pathways. Molecular classification allows recognition of cellular, biochemical, and genetic targets for high-effect precision therapy development. ARCAs represent a significant global health burden, requiring establishment of a robust pathway for novel therapeutic discovery through modification of mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and subsequent clinical trial development.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Glibenclamide for Large Hemispheric Infarction Analyzing mRS and Mortality (CHARM) trial enrolled participants with large hemispheric infarction, randomized to a placebo or intravenous glyburide. Our objective in this post-hoc study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline stroke volume and the potential efficacy of i.v. glyburide.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants enrolled in CHARM and aged ≤70 years were included if a &lt;125 ml ischemic core lesion volume was measured by computed tomography perfusion or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was a shift analysis on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Independent variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, world region, tissue plasminogen activator, and endovascular thrombectomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 147 participants with a baseline large-core stroke volume &lt;125 ml were available for this analysis (mean age 58 years, 37% women, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 18, and the time to study drug was 9.1 ± 2.1 h). The median baseline core volume of 92 mL (IQR 81–107 ml) did not differ by treatment arm. The i.v. glyburide-treated participants had a favorable shift in outcome relative to the placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 2.11, 95% CI 1.10–4.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy, i.v. glyburide-treated subjects had a favorable outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 8.19, 95% CI 1.60–42.0, <i>p</i> = 0.01), fewer decompressive craniectomies (0% vs 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.02), less midline shift (4.2 ± 2.5 mm vs 7.6 ± 5.5 mm, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and lower 90-day mortality (5.6% vs 31%, <i>p</i> = 0.05) compared with the placebo, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This post-hoc analysis of the CHARM trial provides hypothesis-generating evidence that i.v. glyburide may improve outcome in large-core stroke &lt;125 ml, especially among endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients. These results require confirmation in a prospective randomized clinical trial. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:616–624</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elezanumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa), an inhibitor of central nervous system regeneration after inflammation or injury. The aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P were phase 2 trials in relapsing (RADIUS-R) or progressive (RADIUS-P) MS. Participants were randomized to intravenous elezanumab 400mg, 1800mg, or placebo every 4 weeks through week 48. The primary endpoint was the mean Overall Response Score (ORS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In RADIUS-R, 208 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 69), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 69), or placebo (n = 70). In RADIUS-P, 123 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 40), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 40), or placebo (n = 43). The primary endpoint of ORS was not met in either study. For RADIUS-R, mean ORS was −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 400mg and −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 1800mg. For RADIUS-P, mean ORS was 0.0 with effect size of 0.0 for elezanumab 400mg and 0.1 with effect size of 0.1 for elezanumab 1800mg.</p>
<p>Elezanumab was well tolerated; the rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups in both studies. Adverse events with ≥10% of elezanumab population were falls, urinary tract infections, headaches in RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P, and also fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and muscular weakness in RADIUS-P.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elezanumab was safe and well tolerated, but did not meet the primary endpoint in either study. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:590–602</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27263?af=R">Cognitive Performance in Early Neuronal Synuclein Disease with Hyposmia but without Motor Disability: Association with Dopamine Deficiency and Isolated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of dopamine deficiency and isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) on cognitive performance in early neuronal α-synuclein disease (NSD) with hyposmia but without motor disability.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative baseline data, cognitive performance was assessed with a cognitive summary score (CSS) derived from robust healthy control (HC) norms. Performance was examined for participants with hyposmia in early NSD-Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS), either stage 2A (cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein seed amplification assay [SAA]+, dopamine transporter scan [DaTscan]−) or 2B (SAA+, DaTscan+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants were stage 2A (n = 101), stage 2B (N = 227), and HCs (n = 158). Although stage 2 had intact Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (mean [SD] = 27.0 [2.3]), stage 2A had a numerically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.05, <i>p =</i> NS; effect size = 0.09) and stage 2B a statistically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; effect size = 0.40) compared with HCs. In stage 2A, hyposmia alone was associated with normal cognition, but those with comorbid iRBD had significantly worse cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, effect size =0.50). In stage 2B, hyposmia alone had abnormal cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0078, effect size = 0.29), and superimposed iRBD had a statistically significant additive effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using a novel CSS, we demonstrated that hyposmia is associated with cognitive deficits in prodromal NSD without motor disability, particularly when comorbid dopamine system impairment or comorbid iRBD is present. Therefore, it is critical to include and assess cognition at all stages when studying synuclein disease, even in the absence of motor disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:482–491</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27266?af=R">Midlife Steroid‐Binding Globulin Levels and In Vivo Neuroimaging Measures of Tau in Older Men and Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In men and women, sex steroid hormones have been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We aimed to investigate the influence of midlife testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels on later-life in vivo markers of β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau deposition in clinically healthy older men.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This time-lagged study includes participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation cohort. One hundred fifty-nine men (mean age<sub>PET-scan</sub> = 58 [±/9] years) underwent blood (hormones) collection in 2002 to 2005, and then a single Aβ <sup>11</sup>C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET scan in 2016 to 2020. Linear regressions examined sex-stratified associations among total testosterone, and SHBG with Aβ-PET, and tau-PET after adjusting for age. Separate models examined the moderating effect of Aβ-PET and <i>APOE</i>ε4.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In men, the elevated SHBG level was associated with lower tau-PET in entorhinal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0005], <i>p</i> = 0.007), inferior temporal (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.04), and rostral middle frontal regions (B<sub>unstandardized</sub> = −0.001 [SE = 0.0004], <i>p</i> = 0.02). These findings were largely driven by <i>APOE</i>ε4 non-carriers. Testosterone levels were not associated with the Aβ-PET or tau-PET signal.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report a potential protective effect of SHBG levels on tau-PET burden in men. Higher levels of SHBG have been associated with lower risk of vascular-related comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, and is regulated by modifiable lifestyle factors. Given mounting evidence of a link between vascular injury and tauopathy in preclinical AD, our findings suggest an intriguing protective cardiovascular pathway for men against higher tau burden later in life.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27267?af=R">Longitudinal Analysis of Neuroradiological Biomarkers for Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome and Implications for Clinical Trials</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to show the capacity of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures to serve as monitoring biomarkers for Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2 longitudinal studies of male <i>FMR1</i> premutation carriers, 2 brain MRI scans were selected from each participant, collected within a period of 2 years (12 healthy controls, 17 carriers without FXTAS, and 51 carriers with FXTAS; all men, ages 40 to 80 years), along with clinical measurements and <i>FMR1</i> cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat numbers. Candidate MRI biomarkers included whole brain white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cerebellar, brainstem, and whole brain volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the FXTAS group, mixed-effects models demonstrated significant volume loss across an average interval of 1.32 years for the whole brain, cerebellum and brain stem volumes, and significant increases in WMH, with large magnitude effects for whole brain and WMH volumes. All MRI measures showed deterioration with advancing FXTAS stage, with the strongest pattern shown in WMH volume. CGG repeat number showed significant nonlinear associations with all 4 brain MRI metrics, with mid-range CGG repeat carriers evidencing the worst brain atrophy and WMHs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Structural brain MRI measurements, especially those capturing white matter deterioration, are correlated with <i>FMR1</i> premutation size of CGG repeat length and sensitive to FXTAS disease progression across a relatively short interval of less than 2 years, making them potentially suitable as surrogate end points for clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27272?af=R">The Spectrum of Neurologic Phenotypes Associated With NUS1 Pathogenic Variants: A Comprehensive Case Series</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates a strong genetic overlap between developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and movement disorders. De novo loss-of-function variants in <i>NUS1</i> have been recently identified in DEE cases. Herein, we report a large cohort of cases with pathogenic <i>NUS1</i> variants and describe their clinical presentation and the details of the associated epilepsy and movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cases with <i>NUS1</i>-related disorders were identified through a multicentric international collaboration made possible by the GeneMatcher platform. Clinical data were acquired through retrospective case-note review.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 41 subjects carrying 38 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> variants. The majority of cases displayed developmental delays and intellectual disability of variable severity. Epilepsy was present in 68.3% of cases (28/41) with onset typically in early childhood. Strikingly, 87.8% of cases (36/41) presented with movement disorders and for 13 of these cases the movement disorder was not accompanied by epilepsy. The phenomenology of the movement disorders was complex with myoclonus observed in 68.3% of cases (28/41), either in isolation or in combination with dystonia, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Seven cases that otherwise did not have prominent movement disorders had mild incoordination and intention tremor, suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. There was no observed genotype–phenotype correlation, suggesting that other genetic or acquired factors impact the clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> pathogenic variants cause a complex neurological disorder, variably featuring developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and a broad spectrum of movement disorders, which represent the major source of neurological disability for most cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy surgery needs predictive features that are easily implemented in clinical practice. Previous studies are limited by small sample sizes, lack of external validation, and complex computational approaches. We aimed to identify and validate visually stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) features with the highest predictive value for surgical outcome, and assess the reliability of their visual extraction.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 177 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent SEEG-guided surgery at 4 epilepsy centers. We assessed the predictive performance of 10 SEEG features from various SEEG periods for surgical outcome, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and considering resected channels and surgical outcome as the gold standard. Findings were validated externally using balanced accuracy. Six experts, blinded to outcome, evaluated the visual reliability of the optimal feature using interrater reliability, percentage agreement (standard deviation ± SD) and Gwet's kappa (κ ± SD).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The derivation cohort comprised 100 consecutive patients, each with at least 1-year of postoperative follow up (40% temporal lobe epilepsy; 42% Engel Ia). Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes emerged as the optimal predictive feature of surgical outcome (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.82). Applying the optimized threshold from the derivation cohort, external validation in 2 datasets showed similar performances (balanced accuracy 69.2% and 73.2%). Expert interrater reliability for gamma spikes (percentage agreement, 96% ± 2%; κ, 0.63 ± 0.16) and preictal spikes (percentage agreement, 92% ± 2%; κ, 0.65 ± 0.18) were substantial.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spatial co-occurrence of gamma spikes and preictal spikes predicts surgical outcome. These visually identifiable features may reduce the burden of SEEG analysis by reducing analysis time, and improve outcome by guiding surgical resection margins. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:547–560</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Seizures are a highly prevalent comorbidity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a 2- to 6-fold increased risk, and are associated with accelerated cognitive decline. Despite growing research on seizure detection and treatment in AD, the cognitive profiles of individuals with both AD and seizures remain poorly characterized using comprehensive neuropsychological methods.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and cognitive data from individuals age 65+ with AD were analyzed from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Cognitive domains assessed included memory, language, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Raw scores were converted into z-scores using a control sample (n = 14,665). Group comparisons were conducted using independent <i>t</i> tests, χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 9,662 individuals with AD, 1.2% (n = 117) had active seizures (AD-S). The AD-S group was younger, had higher stroke and transient ischemic attack rates, earlier cognitive decline, longer symptom duration, cognitive fluctuations, abrupt cognitive changes, and worse cognitive and functional outcomes. Cognitive deficits in AD-S, particularly in executive function and processing speed, persisted after adjusting for dementia severity. Compared to vascular dementia, AD-S individuals exhibited greater impairments in fluency, naming, and processing speed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Comorbid AD and seizures are associated with distinct cognitive and clinical profiles, greater vascular disease burden, and more severe dementia. Findings emphasize the need for early seizure detection, comprehensive cognitive evaluations, and research on cerebrovascular contributions to inform targeted interventions.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The four-repeat (4R) tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and globular glial tauopathy (GGT). This study aimed to characterize spatiotemporal atrophy progression using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to examine its relationship with clinical course and neuropathology in a cohort of autopsy-confirmed 4R tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study included 85 autopsied patients (54 with PSP, 28 with CBD, and 3 with GGT) who underwent multiple 3T MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological, neurological, and speech/language examinations, and standardized postmortem neuropathological evaluations. An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), was applied to the cross-sectional brain volumes to estimate spatiotemporal atrophy patterns and data-driven subtypes and stages in each patient. The relationships among estimated subtypes, pathological diagnoses, and longitudinal changes in clinical testing were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SuStaIn algorithm identified 2 distinct subtypes: (1) the subcortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the midbrain to the cortex, and (2) the cortical subtype, in which atrophy progresses from the frontal cortex to the subcortical regions. The subcortical subtype was more associated with typical PSP, whereas the cortical subtype was more associated with atypical PSP with a cortical distribution of pathology and CBD (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The cortical subtype had a faster rate of change on the PSP Rating Scale than the subcortical subtype (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SuStaIn analysis revealed 2 MRI-driven subtypes with distinct spatiotemporal atrophy patterns, clinical courses, and neuropathology. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive and improved understanding of disease progression and its relationship to tau pathology in 4R tauopathies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:492–507</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27280?af=R">Carotid Revascularization Versus Medical Management for Ischemic Stroke with Ipsilateral Carotid Web: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Carotid artery web is an underrecognized cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with a high risk of recurrent events. It is uncertain whether medical management or carotid revascularization is beneficial for patients with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral carotid web. In the absence of large randomized clinical trials and observational studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing medical management and carotid revascularization in this population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024485069). We searched five databases: Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We included observational studies that studied the association between recurrent stroke in patients with ipsilateral carotid web receiving medical management (antiplatelet and anticoagulation) and carotid revascularization. Random effects modeling was performed, and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 17 studies (16 published and 1 institutional study). In the medical management group, 32% (90/281) of patients experienced recurrent ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the carotid web. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with carotid revascularization (relative risk 0.11, 95% confidence interval 0.06–0.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>I</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 14.5%). Both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting were equally effective in reducing recurrent stroke risk (relative risk 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.11–1.76, <i>p</i> = 0.99).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Carotid revascularization is associated with reduced recurrence rates, with no difference between revascularization subtypes (carotid endarterectomy vs carotid artery stenting). However, given the small, heterogeneous cohorts and the uncertain natural history of carotid artery web under medical management, these findings should be interpreted with caution until prospective, controlled comparative effectiveness studies are performed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27281?af=R">Effect of Cumulative Exposure to Ocrelizumab on Memory B‐Cell Repopulation Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Extended interval dosing protocols of B-cell-depleting therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS) are being developed, but intervals between infusions are often arbitrary. We describe total and memory B-cell repopulation dynamics in MS patients on a memory B-cell-guided extended interval dosing ocrelizumab (OCR) protocol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>OCR was administered on peripheral CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell repopulation (≥1 cell/μL), monitored using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Associations with CD19+ B cells and CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells were tested using mixed-effect hurdle models, with rate ratios (RR) predicting cell counts and odds ratios (OR) predicting cell depletion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected 1,369 samples from 101 patients, 61.4% women, aged 42.2 years (IQR 32.3–51.1 years) and follow up 4.1 years (IQR 2.9–5.2 years). The median time between samples and previous OCR infusion was 6.6 months (IQR 4.7–8.8 months). Time since previous OCR infusion was positively associated with CD19+ B cells (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.10–1.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell counts (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.09–1.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). A greater cumulative OCR dose was associated with persistent CD19+ CD27+ memory B-cell depletion (OR 1.90, 1.57–2.31, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). CD19+ B-cell repopulation was inversely associated with age (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010). Female patients showed a lower ratio of CD19+ CD27+ memory B cells/total CD19+ B cells (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26–0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Disease activity was low, with most radiological activity observed within the first year of OCR treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Memory B-cell repopulation becomes slower with increasing cumulative OCR dose. Age- and sex-related mechanisms probably influence repopulation dynamics. Given the evidence for a pathogenic role of memory B cells, these observations could be considered when planning extended interval dosing strategies of OCR treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27285?af=R">Timing of Changes in Alzheimer's Disease Plasma Biomarkers as Assessed by Amyloid and Tau PET Clocks</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the timing of change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL) from six different assay platforms, alongside established AD biomarkers, using amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET)-based AD progression timelines.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including 784 individuals with longitudinal amyloid PET and 359 with longitudinal tau PET, were analyzed to estimate the age at amyloid and tau PET positivity, respectively. Longitudinal plasma biomarker measurements were available from 190 individuals with an estimated amyloid PET positivity age and from 70 individuals with an estimated tau PET positivity age. In a subset of 17 clinical progressors, age at tau PET positivity strongly predicted symptom onset, allowing for estimation of symptom onset age. Biomarker trajectories based on time from amyloid or tau PET positivity or symptom onset were modelled using Generalized Additive Mixed models. Time intervals of significant biomarker change and the earliest timepoints at which biomarkers exceeded predefined abnormality thresholds were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All plasma biomarkers except NfL became abnormal prior to established thresholds for amyloid and tau PET positivity. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 became abnormal very early in both amyloid PET and tau PET timelines, while plasma GFAP became abnormal early in the tau PET timeline. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 levels plateaued, whereas plasma p-tau217, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL levels increased throughout the modeled disease progression. Some variations in the timing of these changes were observed across different biomarker assays.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may be useful in identifying individuals with very low levels of amyloid pathology, whereas p-tau, GFAP, and NfL may be useful in staging disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:508–523</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal epilepsy extensively examined through advanced neuroimaging techniques to elucidate its pathophysiological mechanisms. This study investigates the differences in dynamic brain activity and gene expression in TLE patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were collected from 60 TLE patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was employed to identify regions with dALFF variance differences, which were then designated as regions of interest (ROIs). Co-activation patterns (CAP) was constructed to compare brain dynamic changes. Pearson's correlation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms associated with atypical neural dynamics in TLE. Five CAP states were identified from the rs-fMRI data. Compared to HC, TLE with cognitive normal (TLE-CN) and TLE with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) patients exhibited atypical state-specific temporal characteristics, including number of states (counts), fraction of time, persistence, resilience, and transition probability (TP) between states. Importantly, dynamic indicators of CAP states were significantly correlated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, 2752 genes were significantly associated with atypical dynamic brain states in TLE, with these genes primarily enriched in synapse-related pathways. This study offers novel insights into atypical neural dynamics from a temporal perspective. The brain network dynamics defined by CAP analysis deepen our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of TLE and TLE-CI, revealing a link between atypical neural architecture and gene expression in TLE.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of SK channel agonists on seizure-like events (SLEs) in various seizure models in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from pharmacoresistant patients. SLEs were triggered by applying 4-aminopyridine (100 μM) to slices of the entorhinal cortex taken from both normal and pilocarpine-treated rats. Additionally, SLEs were induced in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from individuals who had undergone epilepsy surgery. In the case of human slices, SLEs were also provoked by increasing potassium levels along with the administration of either 4-AP (100 μM) or bicuculline (50 μM). The activation of SK2/3 channels by the compound CYPPA (<i>n</i> = 8) effectively prevented SLEs in slices from the brains of normal rats, pilocarpine-treated rats (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human cortex slices (<i>n</i> = 9) when SLEs were triggered by 4-AP. In human temporal cortex slices, CYPPA also demonstrated efficacy in preventing SLEs induced by an elevation in potassium concentration combined with bicuculline application (<i>n</i> = 5). SKA-31, exhibited efficacy in slices from normal rats (<i>n</i> = 8), rats treated with pilocarpine (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human slices (<i>n</i> = 7) when SLEs were provoked by 4-AP. However, its effectiveness was limited when applied to human tissue slices exposed to bicuculline and elevated potassium levels. The SK1 channel activator GW-542573X displayed only moderate anticonvulsant effects in the models under investigation. SK2 channels showed the highest effectiveness across the different epilepsy models. Sensitivity to the SK3 channel activator was found to be more pronounced compared to the other two activators studied.</p>

                Clarke et al. reveal that non-hematopoietic cells, fibroblastic in nature, located outside the islet of Langerhans, spontaneously present β cell antigens. These cells, associated with the post-capillary venule, express PD-L1. Their potential role in immune modulation is shown by their induction of a tolerance program in pre-activated CD4 T cells.

                Shaikh et al. demonstrate that basigin binds to and controls trafficking of mouse voltage-sensitive lipid phosphatase (mVSP). Basigin promotes plasma membrane localization of mVSP, allowing for control of its activity by the membrane potential. Functional characterization of electrochemical coupling shows phosphoinositide phosphatase activity in a physiological voltage range.
