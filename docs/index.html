              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16791">Multi-faceted Neuroimaging Data Integration via Analysis of Subspaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroimaging studies, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), often collect multi-faceted and multi-block data to study the complex human brain. However, these data are often analyzed in a pairwise fashion, which can hinder our understanding of how different brain-related measures interact with each other. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the multi-block HCP data using the Data Integration via Analysis of Subspaces (DIVAS) method. We integrate structural and functional brain connectivity, substance use, cognition, and genetics in an exhaustive five-block analysis. This gives rise to the important finding that genetics is the single data modality most predictive of brain connectivity, outside of brain connectivity itself. Nearly 14\% of the variation in functional connectivity (FC) and roughly 12\% of the variation in structural connectivity (SC) is attributed to shared spaces with genetics. Moreover, investigations of shared space loadings provide interpretable associations between particular brain regions and drivers of variability, such as alcohol consumption in the substance-use data block. Novel Jackstraw hypothesis tests are developed for the DIVAS framework to establish statistically significant loadings. For example, in the (FC, SC, and Substance Use) shared space, these novel hypothesis tests highlight largely negative functional and structural connections suggesting the brain's role in physiological responses to increased substance use. Furthermore, our findings have been validated using a subset of genetically relevant siblings or twins not studied in the main analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334">Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. While previous studies generally assume uniform growth, recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth. However, the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using ML-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal data from over 1,000 infant MRI scans that captured cortical surface area and thickness during perinatal and postnatal brains development. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We quantified the resulting folding patterns using metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy and autism.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18489">FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.18489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14799">Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.14799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental and understanding conditions. Here, focusing on a methodological procedure, we have worked with young individuals, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose NC was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) and during a short pretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.

                arXiv:2310.12883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both "runs-and-pirouettes" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16916">A Computational Framework for Modeling Emergence of Color Vision in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic nerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it disentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the unknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by simulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how the cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming that the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the visual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color dimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate our theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on established vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from looking at natural images. Further, we propose a model of cortical learning based on self-supervised principle and show that this model naturally learns to generate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory signals. When the retina contains N types of color photoreceptors, our simulation shows that N-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified through formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first simulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed in gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D.

Abstract: As AI solutions enter safety-critical products, the explainability and interpretability of solutions generated by AI products become increasingly important. In the long term, such explanations are the key to gaining users' acceptance of AI-based systems' decisions.

This paper describes a solution to the GECCO'24 Interpretable Control Competition using the open-source software EvoAl.

                arXiv:2408.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) seek to mimic the spiking behavior of biological neurons and are expected to play a key role in the advancement of neural computing and artificial intelligence. The efficiency of SNNs is often determined by the neural coding schemes. Existing coding schemes either cause huge delays and energy consumption or necessitate intricate neuron models and training techniques. To address these issues, we propose a novel Stepwise Weighted Spike (SWS) coding scheme to enhance the encoding of information in spikes. This approach compresses the spikes by weighting the significance of the spike in each step of neural computation, achieving high performance and low energy consumption. A Ternary Self-Amplifying (TSA) neuron model with a silent period is proposed for supporting SWS-based computing, aimed at minimizing the residual error resulting from stepwise weighting in neural computation. Our experimental results show that the SWS coding scheme outperforms the existing neural coding schemes in very deep SNNs, and significantly reduces operations and latency.

                arXiv:2408.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method in various applications of signal processing and feature extraction. It extends principal component analysis (PCA) and can extract important and complicated components with small variances. One of the major problems of ICA is that the uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed, unlike PCA. That is because there are many local optima in optimizing the objective function of ICA. It has been shown previously that the unique global optimum of ICA can be estimated from many random initializations by handcrafted thread computation. In this paper, the unique estimation of ICA is highly accelerated by reformulating the algorithm in matrix representation and reducing redundant calculations. Experimental results on artificial datasets and EEG data verified the efficiency of the proposed method.

Abstract: A natural strategy for continual learning is to weigh a Bayesian ensemble of fixed functions. This suggests that if a (single) neural network could be interpreted as an ensemble, one could design effective algorithms that learn without forgetting. To realize this possibility, we observe that a neural network classifier with N parameters can be interpreted as a weighted ensemble of N classifiers, and that in the lazy regime limit these classifiers are fixed throughout learning. We term these classifiers the neural tangent experts and show they output valid probability distributions over the labels. We then derive the likelihood and posterior probability of each expert given past data. Surprisingly, we learn that the posterior updates for these experts are equivalent to a scaled and projected form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over the network weights. Away from the lazy regime, networks can be seen as ensembles of adaptive experts which improve over time. These results offer a new interpretation of neural networks as Bayesian ensembles of experts, providing a principled framework for understanding and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11138">Spiking Wavelet Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.11138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by emulating the event-driven processing manner of the brain. Incorporating Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy. However, they struggle to learn high-frequency patterns, such as moving edges and pixel-level brightness changes, because they rely on the global self-attention mechanism. Learning these high-frequency representations is challenging but essential for SNN-based event-driven vision. To address this issue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free architecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features in a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The critical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2) convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation - with negative spike dynamics incorporated in 1) to enhance frequency representation. The FATM enables the SWformer to outperform vanilla Spiking Transformers in capturing high-frequency visual components, as evidenced by our empirical results. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate SWformer's effectiveness in capturing spatial-frequency patterns in a multiplication-free and event-driven fashion, outperforming state-of-the-art SNNs. SWformer achieves a 22.03% reduction in parameter count, and a 2.52% performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers. The code is available at: https://github.com/bic-L/Spiking-Wavelet-Transformer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94485">Future movement plans interact in sequential arm movements</a></h4>

              
                Real-world actions often comprise a series of movements that cannot be entirely planned before initiation. When these actions are executed rapidly, the planning of multiple future movements needs to occur simultaneously with the ongoing action. How the brain solves this task remains unknown. Here, we address this question with a new sequential arm reaching paradigm that manipulates how many future reaches are available for planning while controlling execution of the ongoing reach. We show that participants plan at least two future reaches simultaneously with an ongoing reach. Further, the planning processes of the two future reaches are not independent of one another. Evidence that the planning processes interact is twofold. First, correcting for a visual perturbation of the ongoing reach target is slower when more future reaches are planned. Second, the curvature of the current reach is modified based on the next reach only when their planning processes temporally overlap. These interactions between future planning processes may enable smooth production of sequential actions by linking individual segments of a long sequence at the level of motor planning.

">Biological sex determines skeletal muscle atrophy in response to cortical TDP-43 pathology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and incurable neurodegenerative condition. In ALS, wasting of skeletal muscle causes weakness, paralysis and ultimately, death due to respiratory failure. Diagnosis of ALS is a long process and delays in diagnosis are common, which impedes rapid provision of patient care and treatment. Additional tools or methodologies that improve early detection might help overcome the diagnostic delays and enhance survival and quality of life for people with ALS. In this study, we used a transgenic mouse model to create a detailed catalogue of skeletal muscle wasting with the goal of finding muscles that can be examined to enhance early diagnosis of ALS. Methods: Cortical pathology was induced by crossing CaMKIIa-tTA and tetO-hTDP-43{Delta}NLS transgenic mice ({Delta}NLS). Transgenic expression was induced at 30-days postnatal via removal of doxycycline diet. Mice were aged to 15-, 20-, 30- and 45-days post transgene induction. Microdissection was applied to isolate 22 individual hindlimb muscles for measurement of weight. Both males and females were used at all timepoints. Results: We found that male and female {Delta}NLS mice exhibited hindlimb skeletal muscle atrophy relative to controls. Multiply innervated muscles, also known as series-fibered muscles, were especially vulnerable to atrophy. The strongest predictor of the atrophic response across all hindlimb muscles was the extent to which any individual muscle was larger in males than females, known also as sexual dimorphism. In males, muscles that are usually larger in males compared to females experienced the most atrophy. Conversely, in females, muscles that are usually of similar size between males and females experienced the most atrophy. Segregating muscles based on whether they were more affected in males or females revealed that hip extensors, knee flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors and ankle evertors were more affected in males. Hip adductors, hip rotators, hip flexors and ankle plantarflexors were more affected in females. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the difference in the size of skeletal muscles in males compared to females is the most powerful predictor of muscle atrophy in response to dying forward pathology. This indicates that sex is a strong determinant of skeletal muscle vulnerability in ALS. Our results provide new insights into determinants of skeletal muscle atrophy and may help inform selection of muscles for diagnostic testing of ALS patients.

">Astrocyte-derived MFG-E8 facilitates microglial synapse elimination in Alzheimer's disease mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Region-specific synapse loss is an early pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging data in mice and humans highlight microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, as cellular mediators of synapse loss; however, the upstream modulators of microglia-synapse engulfment remain elusive. Here, we report a distinct subset of astrocytes, which are glial cells essential for maintaining synapse homeostasis, appearing in a region-specific manner with age and amyloidosis at onset of synapse loss. These astrocytes are distinguished by their peri-synaptic processes which are 'bulbous' in morphology, contain accumulated p62-immunoreactive bodies, and have reduced territorial domains, resulting in a decrease of astrocyte-synapse coverage. Using integrated in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that astrocytes upregulate and secrete phagocytic modulator, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8), which is sufficient and necessary for promoting microglia-synapse engulfment in their local milieu. Finally, we show that knocking down Mfge8 specifically from astrocytes using a viral CRISPR-saCas9 system prevents microglia-synapse engulfment and ameliorates synapse loss in two independent amyloidosis mouse models of AD. Altogether, our findings highlight astrocyte-microglia crosstalk in determining synapse fate in amyloid models and nominate astrocytic MFGE8 as a potential target to ameliorate synapse loss during the earliest stages of AD.

">Synaptic imbalance and increased inhibition impair motor function in SMA</a></h4>

              
                Movement is executed through the balanced action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in motor circuits of the spinal cord. Short-term perturbations in one of the two types of transmission are counteracted by homeostatic changes of the opposing type. Prolonged failure to balance excitatory and inhibitory drive results in dysfunction at the single neuron, as well as neuronal network levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used mouse genetics, functional assays, morphological methods, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition neurotransmission in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable motor circuits in the SMA spinal cord fail to respond homeostatically to the reduction of excitatory drive and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment to activate muscle contraction. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological reduction of inhibitory synaptic drive improves neuronal function and provides behavioural benefit in SMA mice. Our findings identify the lack of excitation-inhibition homeostasis as a major maladaptive mechanism in SMA, by which the combined effects of reduced excitation and increased inhibition diminish the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions.

">Estimating the Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance from Electrocorticography Data using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain is crucial for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying various cognitive functions and states of consciousness. Mathematical models have provided significant insights into these mechanisms, but they often face challenges due to high dimensionality, noisy observation signals, and nonlinearities. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate the E/I balance from electrocorticography (ECoG) data, effectively addressing these limitations. By integrating physical laws via a neural mass model with neural network training, our approach enhances parameter estimation accuracy and robustness. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in long-range connections (LRCs) and excitatory short-range connections (SRCs) under anesthesia, alongside an increase in inhibitory SRCs, highlighting anesthesia's role in modulating neural dynamics to induce unconsciousness. These findings not only corroborate existing theories on the neural mechanisms of anesthesia but also provide new insights into brain connectivity and its relationship with consciousness.

">Unbiased preclinical phenotyping reveals neuroprotective properties of pioglitazone</a></h4>

              
                Animal models are essential for assessing the preclinical efficacy of candidate drugs, but animal data often fails to replicate in human clinical trials. This translational gulf is due in part to the use of models that do not accurately replicate human disease processes and phenotyping strategies that do not capture sensitive, disease-relevant measures. To address these challenges with the aim of validating candidate neuroprotective drugs, we combined a mouse prion (RML scrapie) model that recapitulates the key common features of human neurodegenerative disease including bona fide neuronal loss, with unbiased and machine learning-assisted behavioural phenotyping. We found that this approach measured subtle, stereotyped, and progressive changes in motor behaviour over the disease time course that correlated with the earliest detectable histopathological changes in the mouse brain. To validate the utility of this model system, we tested whether the anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone could slow prion disease progression. Pioglitazone crosses the blood-brain-barrier and has been shown to reduce neurodegenerative disease severity in other mouse models. We found that in addition to significantly slowing the emergence of early-stage clinical signs of neurodegeneration, pioglitazone significantly improved motor coordination throughout the disease time course and reduced neuronal endoplasmic reticulum stress. Together, these findings suggest that pioglitazone could have neuroprotective properties in humans, confirm the utility of the scrapie mouse model of neurodegeneration, and provide generalisable experimental and analysis methods for the generation of data-rich behavioural data to accelerate and improve preclinical validation.

">Chronic mitochondrial fragmentation elicits a neuroprotective Warburg-like effect in Drosophila neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamic and important cellular processes, but the roles of these two very different mitochondrial forms, predominantly spherical and tubular are not well-characterized in neurons of animals and especially in aging neurons. This is important because neurons are long-lived and mitochondrial dynamics is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We used here an efficient cell type-specific CRISPR approach to knockout key fission-fusion genes and disrupt mitochondrial dynamics within the inessential clock neurons of Drosophila. Surprisingly, fusion is much more important than fission for maintaining long-term neuronal function. Neurons survive chronic mitochondrial fragmentation due to loss of fusion by triggering a cancer-like transcriptomic response. This Warburg effect includes ATF4-mediated upregulation of the aerobic glycolysis gene Lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh), and LDH is essential to prevent neurodegeneration of neurons deficient in the fusion gene Opa1. These results and others provide insights into the intersection of neuronal metabolism, aging and neurodegeneration.

                Neuroparsin is a common insect neurohormone produced in large neuroendocrine cells in the brain and is important in mosquito reproduction. Although it is present in many flies including many Drosophila species, it was lost from D. melanogaster and a few closely related species. Three different lines of transgenic D. virilis were produced: One that expresses the yeast transcription factor gal4 under the control of the neuroparsin promoter (NP-gal4), while others codes for proteins under the control of the gal4 promoter, either enhanced green fluorescent protein (UAS-eGFP) or the D. virilis ortholog of reaper, an apoptosis inducing protein (UAS-rpr). Crosses between UAS-eGFP and NP-gal4 revealed that expression of NP-gal4 was correct. Crosses between UAS-rpr and NP-gal4 completely eliminated the neuroparsin neuroendocrine cells, but were without effect on reproduction.

">Differential coding of fruit, leaf, and microbial odours in the brains of Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h4>

              
                The fly Drosophila suzukii, a close relative of D. melanogaster severely damages the production of berry and stone fruits in large parts of the world. Unlike D. melanogaster, which reproduces on overripe and fermenting fruits on the ground, D. suzukii prefers to lay its eggs in ripening fruits still on the plants. Flies locate fruit hosts by their odorant volatiles, which are detected and encoded by a highly specialized olfactory system before being translated into behaviour. The exact information processing pathway is not yet fully understood, especially the evaluation of odour attractiveness. It is also unclear what differentiates the brains of D. suzukii and D. melanogaster to cause the crucial difference in host selection. We hypothesized that the basis for different behaviours is already formed at the level of the antennal lobe of D. suzukii and D. melanogaster, by different neuronal responses to volatiles associated with ripe and fermenting fruit. We thus investigated by 3D in vivo two-photon calcium imaging how both species encoded odours from ripe fruits, leaves, fermented fruits, bacteria, and their mixtures in the antennal lobe. We then assessed their behavioural responses to mixtures of ripe and fermenting odours. The neural responses reflect species-dependent shifts in the odour code. In addition to this, morphological differences were also observed. Yet this was not directly reflected in different behavioural responses to the odours tested.

">Neural Basis of Number Sense in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Number sense, the ability to discriminate the quantity of objects, is crucial for survival. To understand how neurons work together and develop to mediate number sense, we used two-photon fluorescence light sheet microscopy to capture the activity of individual neurons throughout the brain of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), while displaying a visual number stimulus to the animal. We identified number-selective neurons as early as 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and found a proportional increase of neurons tuned to larger (>2) quantities after 3 dpf. To determine if these neurons are sufficient to encode the correct quantity, we used machine learning to predict the stimulus from the neuronal activity and observed that the prediction accuracy improves with age. Given ethanol's propensity to inhibit cognitive functions, we tested its effect on number sense and found a decrease of active number-selective neurons in the forebrain during ethanol exposure, suggesting cognitive impairment. The findings here are a significant step towards understanding neural circuits devoted to discrete magnitudes and our methodology to track single neuron activity across the whole brain is broadly applicable to other fields in neuroscience.

">Acetylcholine modulates prefrontal outcome coding during threat learning under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Outcomes can vary even when choices are repeated. Such ambiguity necessitates adjusting how much to learn from each outcome by tracking its variability. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been reported to signal the expected outcome and its discrepancy from the actual outcome (prediction error), two variables essential for controlling the learning rate. However, the source of signals that shape these coding properties remains unknown. Here, we investigated the contribution of cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain because they carry precisely timed signals about outcomes. One-photon calcium imaging revealed that as mice learned different probabilities of threat occurrence on two paths, some mPFC cells responded to threats on one of the paths, while other cells gained responses to threat omission. These threat- and omission-evoked responses were scaled to the unexpectedness of outcomes, some exhibiting a reversal in response direction when encountering surprising threats as opposed to surprising omissions. This selectivity for signed prediction errors was enhanced by optogenetic stimulation of local cholinergic terminals during threats. The enhanced threat-evoked cholinergic signals also made mice erroneously abandon the correct choice after a single threat that violated expectations, thereby decoupling their path choice from the history of threat occurrence on each path. Thus, acetylcholine modulates the encoding of surprising outcomes in the mPFC to control how much they dictate future decisions.

">Target Identification Under High Levels of Amplitude, Size, Orientation and Background Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Many natural tasks require the visual system to classify image patches accurately into target categories, including the category of no target. Natural target categories often involve high levels of within-category variability (uncertainty), making it challenging to uncover the underlying computational mechanisms. Here, we describe these tasks as identification from a set of exhaustive, mutually exclusive target categories, each partitioned into mutually exclusive subcategories. We derive the optimal decision rule and present a computational method to simulate performance for moderately large and complex tasks. We focus on the detection of an additive wavelet target in white noise with five dimensions of stimulus uncertainty: target amplitude, orientation, scale, background contrast, and spatial pattern. We compare the performance of the ideal observer with various heuristic observers. We find that a properly normalized heuristic MAX observer (SNN-MAX) approximates optimal performance. We also find that a convolutional neural network trained on this task approaches but does not reach optimal performance, even with extensive training. We measured human performance on a task with three of these dimensions of uncertainty (orientation, scale, and background pattern). Results show that the pattern of hits and correct rejections for the ideal and SNN-MAX observers (but not a simple MAX observer) aligns with the data. Additionally, we measured performance under low uncertainty (without scale and orientation uncertainty) and found that the effect of uncertainty on the performance is smaller than any of the models predicted. This smaller-than-expected effect can largely be explained by including biologically plausible levels of intrinsic position uncertainty.

">Validation studies and multi-omics analysis of Zhx2 as a candidate quantitative trait gene underlying brain oxycodone metabolite (oxymorphone) levels and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Sensitivity to the subjective reinforcing properties of opioids has a genetic component and can predict addiction liability of opioid compounds. We previously identified Zhx2 as a candidate gene underlying increased brain concentration of the oxycodone (OXY) metabolite oxymorphone (OMOR) in BALB/cJ (J) versus BALB/cByJ (By) females that could increase OXY state-dependent reward. A large structural intronic variant is associated with a robust reduction of Zhx2 expression in J mice, which we hypothesized enhances OMOR levels and OXY addiction-like behaviors. We tested this hypothesis by restoring the Zhx2 loss-of-function in Js (MVKO) and modeling the loss-of-function variant through knocking out the Zhx2 coding exon (E3KO) in Bys and assessing brain OXY metabolite levels and behavior. Consistent with our hypothesis, Zhx2 E3KO females showed an increase in brain OMOR levels and OXY-induced locomotor activity. However, contrary to our hypothesis, state-dependent expression of OXY-CPP was decreased in E3KO females and increased in E3KO males. We also overexpressed Zhx2 in the livers and brains of Js and observed Zhx2 overexpression in select brain regions that was associated with reduced OXY state-dependent learning. Integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of E3KO mice identified astrocyte function, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix properties, and endothelial cell functions as pathways influencing brain OXY metabolite concentration and behavior. These results support Zhx2 as a quantitative trait gene underlying brain OMOR concentration that is associated with changes in OXY behavior and implicate potential quantitative trait mechanisms that together inform our overall understanding of Zhx2 in brain function.

">CHCHD2 mutant mice display mitochondrial protein accumulation and disrupted energy metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the mitochondrial cristae protein CHCHD2 lead to a late-onset autosomal dominant form of Parkinson's disease (PD) which closely resembles idiopathic PD, providing the opportunity to gain new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to PD. To begin to address this, we used CRISPR genome-editing to generate CHCHD2 T61I point mutant mice. CHCHD2 T61I mice had normal viability, and had only subtle motor deficits with no signs of premature dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration. Nonetheless, CHCHD2 T61I mice exhibited robust molecular changes in the brain including increased CHCHD2 insolubility, accumulation of CHCHD2 protein preferentially in the substantia nigra (SN), and elevated levels of -synuclein. Metabolic analyses revealed an increase in glucose metabolism through glycolysis relative to the TCA cycle with increased respiratory exchange ratio, and immune-electron microscopy revelated disrupted mitochondria in DA neurons. Moreover, spatial genomics revealed decreased expression of mitochondrial complex I and III respiratory chain proteins, while proteomics revealed increased respiratory chain and other mitochondrial protein-protein interactions. As such, the CHCHD2 T61I point-mutation mice exhibit robust mitochondrial disruption and a consequent metabolic shift towards glycolysis. These findings thus establish CHCHD2 T61I mice as a new model for mitochondrial-based PD, and implicate disrupted respiratory chain function as a likely causative driver.

">The impact of language proficiency on task-dependent neural activity and functional connectivity: Insights from deafness</a></h4>

              
                Our study aimed to investigate the impact of differences in language proficiency on the neural correlates of cognitive processing in deaf adults. In congenitally and early deaf individuals, individual differences in language proficiency reflect the degree of language access during critical developmental periods and significantly influence cognitive function. By studying the neural substrates of cognition in a population with diverse language backgrounds and skills, we can explore the influence of early language experience on the formation of cognitive networks in the brain. We used functional MRI in a group of deaf adults with varying language experience backgrounds and a control group of hearing participants. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that differences in language skills modulate neural response and functional connectivity during the execution of demanding cognitive tasks tapping into working memory and planning. Our study revealed that differences in language proficiency, independently of language modality (signed or spoken), are positively correlated with neural activity and functional connectivity within regions of the task-positive network during working memory in deaf adults. Furthermore, compared to hearing participants, the deaf group showed distinctive patterns of neural activity and connectivity during working memory task performance in task-dependent regions of the brain. Taken together, our findings emphasise the profound impact of early environmental experiences on brain responses during cognitive processing. Specifically, they highlight the role of language proficiency in shaping and supporting high-order cognition in the brain.

">The human hippocampus is involved in implicit motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, traditionally associated with declarative memory, plays a role in motor sequence learning (MSL). However, the classic MSL paradigm depends initially on declarative learning. Therefore, it is critical to discern whether the participation of the hippocampus relates to its canonical role or to processing a general aspect of learning that transcends the declarative/non-declarative distinction. To address this issue, here we turn to visuomotor adaptation -a type of motor learning involving skill recalibration- which unlike MSL can be easily manipulated to eliminate the explicit component. Here, we examined the broader involvement of the hippocampus in procedural motor learning by using diffusion MRI to indirectly assess structural plasticity associated with memory consolidation in visuomotor adaptation (VMA) and an implicit-only version (IVMA). We found that both VMA and IVMA engaged the left posterior hippocampus in a learning-specific manner. Remarkably, while VMA induced only transient hippocampal alterations, IVMA elicited structural changes that persisted overnight, underscoring the reliance on implicit learning for enduring neuroplasticity. As expected, training on both visuomotor tasks impacted the microstructure of the cerebellum, the motor and the posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the temporal dynamics of changes in these regions closely paralleled those of the left hippocampus, suggesting that motor and limbic regions operate in a coordinated manner as part of the same neural network. Collectively, our findings support an active role of the hippocampus in procedural motor memory and argue for a unified function in memory encoding regardless of the declarative or non-declarative nature of the task.

">Neuronal firing rate diversity lowers the dimension of population covariability</a></h4>

              
                Populations of neurons produce activity with two central features. First, neuronal responses are very diverse -- specific stimuli or behaviors prompt some neurons to emit many action potentials, while other neurons remain relatively silent. Second, the trial-to-trial fluctuations of neuronal response occupy a low dimensional space, owing to significant correlations between the activity of neurons. These two features define the quality of neuronal representation. We link these two aspects of population response using a recurrent circuit model and derive the following relation: the more diverse the firing rates of neurons in a population, the lower the effective dimension of population trial-to-trial covariability. This surprising prediction is tested and validated using simultaneously recorded neuronal populations from numerous brain areas in mice, non-human primates, and in the motor cortex of human participants. Using our relation we present a theory where a more diverse neuronal code leads to better fine discrimination performance from population activity. In line with this theory, we show that neuronal populations across the brain exhibit both more diverse mean responses and lower-dimensional fluctuations when the brain is in more heightened states of information processing. In sum, we present a key organizational principle of neuronal population response that is widely observed across the nervous system and acts to synergistically improve population representation.

">Population-level age effects on the white matter structure subserving cognitive flexibility in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, a cognition crucial for adaptive behavior, involves multi-scale functioning across several neuronal organization levels. While the neural underpinnings of flexibility have been studied for decades, limited knowledge exist about the structure and differentiation of the white matter subserving brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility. Neural changes that occur over the lifespan have an impact in the brain white matter organization and, thereby, may alter cognitive flexibility abilities. This study investigates the population-level relationship between cognitive flexibility and macromolecular properties of white matter across two periods of adulthood, aiming to discern how these associations vary over different life stages and brain tracts. A novel method to study age-effects in the brain structure-function associations is proposed. First, the white matter structure implicated in cognitive flexibility was delineated by tracing in the Human Connectome Project tractography template the pathways subserving neural regions derived via meta-analysis of set-shifting. Then, a cohort analysis was performed to characterize related brain features using a subset of the UKBiobank MRI data which has a companion functional/behavioral dataset.1 We found that (1) the wiring of cognitive flexibility is defined by specialized tracts, which present undifferentiated features early in adulthood, and significantly differentiated types in later life. (2) These MRI-derived properties are correlated with individual subprocesses of cognition which intimately relate to the latent construct of cognitive flexibility function (switch, inhibition, and updating).2 (3)In late life, myelin-related homogeneity of specific white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility declines as a function of chronological age, a phenomenon not observed in early life. Our findings support the age-related differentiation of white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility as a natural substrate of brain adaptive function.

">Switching on Behavioral and Neural Rhythmicity to Retrieve Memories When the Number of Retained Items Exceeds Four</a></h4>

              
                Even when we experience difficulty in recalling memories, we nevertheless manage to retrieve the target items. However, the neural mechanisms that enable such difficult memory retrieval are unknown. Here, we report an intriguing phenomenon where our nervous system "switches on" behavioral/neural rhythmicity to retrieve memory when the number of candidate items exceeds four. In our experiments, participants learned and retrieved 2-5 color/letter pairs. Analyses of hundreds of reaction times revealed a significant tendency for memory recall to occur at discrete times corresponding to theta-alpha (4-13 Hz) cycles, but only when the number of memorized pairs exceeded four. Electrophysiological data localized theta-alpha rhythmicity around parietal electrodes, a region associated with the long-term memory system. Our findings suggest that neural rhythmicity facilitates memory retrieval when the number of candidate items exceeds four, which is known as the "magical number" corresponding to the limit of human cognitive capacity.

">Noradrenaline causes a spread of association in the hippocampal cognitive map</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain stores relationships between items and events in the world as cognitive maps in the hippocampal system. However, the neural mechanisms that control cognitive map formation remain unclear. Here, using a double-blind study design with a pharmacological intervention in humans, we show that the neuromodulator noradrenaline elicits a significant 'spread of association' across the hippocampal cognitive map. This neural spread of association predicts overgeneralisation errors measured in behaviour, and is predicted by physiological markers for noradrenergic arousal, namely an increase in the pupil dilation response and reduced cortical GABAergic tone. Thus, noradrenaline sets the width of the 'smoothing kernel' for plasticity across the cognitive map. Elevated noradrenaline can allow disparate memories to become linked, introducing potential for distortions in the cognitive map that deviate from direct experience.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.

                Weakening of synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction triggers two forms of homeostatic compensation, one that increases the probability of glutamate release per action potential (Pr) and another that increases motoneuron (MN) activity. We investigated the molecular changes in MNs that underlie the increase in MN activity. RNA-seq analysis on MNs whose glutamate release is weakened by knockdown of components of the MN transmitter release machinery reveals a reduction in expression of a group of genes that encode potassium channels and their positive modulators. These results identify a mechanism of compensation for weakened synaptic transmission by MNs, which engages a transcriptional program in those cells to increase firing and, thereby, ensure sufficient locomotory drive.

">MorphoCellSorter: An Andrews plot-based sorting approach to rank microglia according to their morphological features</a></h4>

              
                Microglia exhibit diverse morphologies reflecting environmental conditions, maturity or functional states. Thus, morphological characterization provides important information to understand microglial roles and functions. Most recent morphological analysis relies on classifying cells based on morphological parameters. However, this classification is not always biologically relevant, as microglial morphologies constitute a continuum rather than segregated groups. Instead, we propose a new open-source tool, MorphoCellSorter, which assesses microglial morphology by automatically computing morphological criteria, using principal component analysis and Andrews plots to rank cells. MorphoCellSorter accurately ranked cells from various microglia datasets in mice and rats of different age, from in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models, that were acquired using diverse imaging techniques. This approach allowed for the discrimination of cell populations in various pathophysiological conditions. Finally, MorphoCellSorter offers a versatile, easy and ready-to-use method to evaluate microglial morphological diversity that could easily be generalized to standardize practices across laboratories.

	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer simulations, and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly becoming accessible tools that can be leveraged to implement training protocols and educational resources. Typical assessment tools related to sensory and neural processing associated with task performance in virtual environments often rely on self-reported surveys, unlike electroencephalography (EEG), which is often used to compare the effects of different types of sensory feedback (e.g., auditory, visual, and haptic) in simulation environments in an objective manner. However, it can be challenging to know which aspects of the EEG signal represent the impact of different types of sensory feedback on neural processing. Machine learning approaches offer a promising direction for identifying EEG signal features that differentiate the impact of different types of sensory feedback during simulation training. For the current study, machine learning techniques were applied to differentiate neural circuitry associated with haptic and non-haptic feedback in a simulated drilling task. Nine EEG channels were selected and analyzed, extracting different time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features, where 360 features were tested (40 features per channel). A feature selection stage identified the most relevant features, including the Hurst exponent of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz, kurtosis of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, power spectral density of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, variance of 21&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz, and spectral entropy of 13&amp;amp;ndash;21 Hz. Using those five features, trials with haptic feedback were correctly identified from those without haptic feedback with an accuracy exceeding 90%, increasing to 99% when using 10 features. These results show promise for the future application of machine learning approaches to predict the impact of haptic feedback on neural processing during VR protocols involving drilling tasks, which can inform future applications of VR and simulation for occupational skill acquisition.</p>

	<p>During the period in which children learn to read and write, a gradual shift from right to left hemisphere dominance for language is typically seen. However, in children with dyslexia, a deviant pattern is described in the literature. As part of a larger longitudinal study (The Bergen Longitudinal Dyslexia Study), the present study aimed to assess this development from an early age before children learn to read and write. Dichotic listening (DL), which is a non-invasive test, was used to assess the development of brain laterality in a Typical group and a Dyslexia group. The participants received yearly sessions of evidence-based literacy training at ages 5 to 7. The Typical group showed increasing ear scores and a shift from no ear advantage in the Pre-literacy stage (age 6), indicative of no hemisphere dominance, to a right ear advantage, indicative of a left hemisphere dominance, in the Emergent literacy stage (age 8) and the Literacy stage (age 11). The Dyslexia group showed a different pattern, with a significant right ear advantage at age 6, indicative of a right hemisphere dominance, and increasing ear scores at ages 8 and 11; however, no ear dominance was observed in the Literacy stage. The results point to an effect of relevant, evidence-based training affecting both right and left hemispheres in dyslexia, which should form a basis for further research.</p>

	<p>Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is associated with seizures. We examined the impact of repeated seizures on the behavioral and molecular changes in male Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Methods: Seizures were induced by administering three flurothyl seizures per day across postnatal days (PD) 7&amp;amp;ndash;11, for a total of 15 seizures. In adulthood, mice were tested in a battery of behavioral tasks to assess long-term behavioral deficits. Results: The two-hit impact of a Fmr1 knockout and seizures resulted in decreased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test and a longer latency to their first nose poke (repetitive behavior). Seizures resulted in decreased activity, decreased repetitive behavior (grooming and rearings), and decreased social behavior, while they also increased habituation to auditory stimuli and increased freezing in delayed fear conditioning in both KO and control mice. KO mice displayed increased repetitive behavior in the open field task (clockwise revolutions) and repeated nose pokes, and decreased anxiety in the open field test. No differences in mTOR signaling were found. Conclusions: These findings further illuminate the long-term effects of synergistic impact of two hits on the developing brain.</p>

	<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that has been suggested as a possible treatment method for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (pwAD), similar to multidomain cognitive training (CT). The effectiveness, however, of combining these techniques for pwAD remains controversial due to the variability in rTMS parameters, differences in CT protocol designs&amp;amp;mdash;many of which neglect the language domain&amp;amp;mdash;and the inclusion of patients at various stages of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) and with different types of dementia. The current review aims to evaluate the cognitive benefits of combining rTMS with CT, including language training, for individuals with mild to moderate AD. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library with relevant terms, resulting in nine studies with a total of 290 participants [190 in the Active Group (AG) and 100 in the Control Group (CG)]. The comprehensive review of the articles revealed that the combined treatment improved global cognitive function, as well as neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and quality of life in the AG. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously, given the relatively small number of existing studies on this specific combination.</p>

	<p>Anhedonia constitutes a core symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD) mediating the ultimate goal of MDD treatment: functional remission. Anhedonia is also present in other clinical populations, including patients with chronic pain. Recent data links anhedonia to insulin resistance (IR). Some researchers have underlined a different dimension of anhedonia as a temperament/personality trait. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to explore the links between anhedonia (main outcome) and (1) IR, (2) temperamental, personality, and schizotypy traits (exposures). The study population included patients with MDD, fibromyalgia, and healthy controls. Participants were split into groups: (1) insulin resistant (IR[+] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;ge; 2.1) and (2) insulin sensitive (IR[&amp;amp;minus;] n = 69, HOMA-IR &amp;amp;lt; 2.1). Anhedonia was significantly higher in the IR[+] group than the IR[&amp;amp;minus;] group. IR was a predictor of higher anhedonia levels. IR[+] vs. IR[&amp;amp;minus;] participants showed higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of hyperthymic affective temperaments, as well as conscientiousness and emotional stability personality traits. Depressive, irritable, and anxious temperaments, cognitive disorganization, and introvertive anhedonia positively predicted anhedonia, while hyperthymic temperament, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability traits negatively predicted anhedonia. IR partially mediated the relationship between depressive temperament and anhedonia. In sum, IR, affective temperaments, and personality traits are predictors of anhedonia.</p>

                <p>Episodic memory, the ability to recall specific events and experiences, is a cornerstone of human cognition with profound clinical implications. While animal studies have provided valuable insights into the neuronal underpinnings of episodic memory, research has largely relied on a limited subset of tasks that model only some aspects of episodic memory. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of rodent episodic-like memory tasks that expand the methodological repertoire and diversify the approaches used in episodic-like memory research. These tasks assess various aspects of human episodic memory, such as integrated <I>what&ndash;where&ndash;when</I> or <I>what&ndash;where memory</I>, source memory, free recall, temporal binding, and threshold retrieval dynamics. We review each task&rsquo;s general principle and consider whether alternative non-episodic mechanisms can account for the observed behavior. While our list of tasks is not exhaustive, we hope it will guide researchers in selecting models that align with their specific research objectives, leading to novel advancements and a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying specific aspects of episodic memory.</p>

                Background Motorcycle accidents can be particularly hazardous, as riders are exposed to various risk factors, such as high speeds, lack of protective enclosures, and limited safety features. Aim of the study To describe the ocular injuries associated with motorcycled accidents presented to tertiary hospitals and forensic centers in Iraq. Patients and methods The study was conducted in three Teaching hospitals and forensic centers in Baghdad and Al-Qadisiyah in Iraq. Information regarding ocular injuries, recorded and classified according to the International Ocular Trauma Classification, was gathered from motorcycle crash injuries that were presented to the emergency departments of these facilities from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2023 Results The study involved 335 ophthalmological accidents; the mean age of the patients was 27.84± 9.6 years, most of them were males (96.7%), and there were only 11 females as passengers, 39 (11.6%) had injuries in both eyes. Lesions involving the periorbita, lids, and conjunctiva comprised most of the findings. There were 60.9% of patients with lid lacerations with or without sub-conjunctival bleeding, 22.1% with corneoscleral injury, and 17.9% with commotio retinae. It was the leading cause of decreased visual acuity, with 9% having lens capsule damage with or without iris prolapse and 8.1% having a ruptured capsule, 55.82% of patients had a mild injury, 27.16% had a moderate injury, and 17.01% had a severe injury. Conclusion Eye injury associated with motorcycle accidents mainly affects males in their youth age and has serious outcomes, sometimes ending with blindness.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The main purpose of this study was to explore experiences of women who survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital, 2021. Design: An institution-based exploratory qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological study design Setting: The present study was conducted in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital from March 03 to May 18, 2021. Participants: A total of 17 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women who experienced and survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software. Result: The present study revealed that women’s level of awareness on raised blood pressure and or convulsion occurring during pregnancy was poor. Barriers that limit pregnant women from getting treatment at the earliest point included misconception, lack of insight, failure to accept counseling from health care providers, low income, and influence from husbands. Discussions with the women in this study showed that these mothers were not counseled on danger signs during antenatal care check-ups. Almost all of the women were very concerned and frustrated due to their diagnosis. Conclusions: Women’s awareness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was poor and antenatal care was not offered as per expected quality. Improving awareness of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and enhancing the quality of antenatal care is essential.

                Background This study delved into the experiences and approaches employed by junior teachers in facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences during the teaching and learning process. In South Africa, Grade 7 marks the final year of primary school education, with learners typically aged between 11 to 13. The researchers noted significant challenges faced by junior Grade 7 teachers in preparing, organizing, and carrying out practical work within the context of teaching and learning in Natural Sciences. Methods In the present study, a qualitative multiple-case study design was employed. Three grade 7 Natural Sciences junior-level teachers were purposefully selected as participants. Data was gathered through classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. Results The study findings revealed that certain grade 7 junior Natural Sciences teachers found it challenging to manage practical work during teaching and learning. Some teachers also faced difficulties in maintaining discipline during practical work and demonstrations, both inside and outside the classroom. To cope with the demands of facilitating practical work in Natural Sciences teaching and learning, teachers employed various approaches, such as group work, observations, demonstrations, illustrations, projects, and inquiry-based scientific investigations. Conclusion It is recommended that teachers should receive professional training on effectively facilitating practical work to support the new teaching and learning methods outlined in the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement. They should also be equipped with pedagogical content knowledge to help them achieve the goals of practical work in teaching and learning Natural Sciences.

                Background Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) encompass a heterogenous group of auto-immune diseases. The identification of myositis specific antibodies (MSA) and their associations with distinct phenotypes has improved the categorization of these conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to describe and report the clinical and immunological characteristics of IIM among Tunisian patients. Method A retrospective study conducted in the internal medicine department at the Rabta University Hospital Center over 22 years, including adult patients with IIM according to the American college of rheumatology/European league against rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria and Connors’ criteria for anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS). Inclusion body myositis and myositis associated with other conditions were excluded. Demographic, clinical, and immunological characteristics were analyzed and compared. Results Ninety-seven patients were included (Male/female ratio= 0.36, mean age = 48.4 +- 13.8 years). Muscular involvement was present in 88% of patients, affecting locomotor muscles (88%), gastrointestinal (43%), laryngeal (10%), cardiac (8%), and respiratory (1%) systems. Muscle weakness was primarily noted in the pelvic girdle (81%), scapular region (74%), axial muscles (20%), and distal muscles (5%). Myolysis was observed in 77% of patients, and histological evidence of myositis in 73%. Diffuse interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was present in 45% of patients, cutaneous involvement in 85%, and articular involvement in 48%. MSAs were detected in 52% of patients. Analysis revealed significantly higher frequencies of amyopathic forms, DIP, palmar hyperkeratosis, and articular involvement in the ASS group. The DM group exhibited higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, photosensitive rashes, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. The NAM group had higher frequencies of gastrointestinal signs, myolysis, and lower frequencies of DIP and cutaneous involvement. Conclusion Our findings corroborate previously established clinico-immunological associations reported in the literature underscoring the need for a combined clinico-serological approach in classifying IIM.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O’Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                <p>by Tao Wang, Linlin Zhuo, Yifan Chen, Xiangzheng Fu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Quan Zou</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes (CDGs) poses challenges due to the intricate interdependencies among genes and the influence of measurement errors and noise. We propose a novel energy-constrained diffusion (ECD)-based model for identifying CDGs, termed ECD-CDGI. This model is the first to design an ECD-Attention encoder by combining the ECD technique with an attention mechanism. ECD-Attention encoder excels at generating robust gene representations that reveal the complex interdependencies among genes while reducing the impact of data noise. We concatenate topological embedding extracted from gene-gene networks through graph transformers to these gene representations. We conduct extensive experiments across three testing scenarios. Extensive experiments show that the ECD-CDGI model possesses the ability to not only be proficient in identifying known CDGs but also efficiently uncover unknown potential CDGs. Furthermore, compared to the GNN-based approach, the ECD-CDGI model exhibits fewer constraints by existing gene-gene networks, thereby enhancing its capability to identify CDGs. Additionally, ECD-CDGI is open-source and freely available. We have also launched the model as a complimentary online tool specifically crafted to expedite research efforts focused on CDGs identification.

                <p>by Daniel Seeler, Nastasja Grdseloff, Claudia Jasmin Rödel, Charlotte Kloft, Salim Abdelilah-Seyfried, Wilhelm Huisinga</p>

Endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, locally sense and respond to blood flow. In response to altered blood flow dynamics during early embryonic development, these cells undergo shape changes that directly affect vessel geometry: In the dorsal aorta of zebrafish embryos, elongation of endothelial cells in the direction of flow between 48 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) reduces the vessel’s diameter. This remodeling process requires Endoglin; excessive endothelial cell growth in the protein’s absence results in vessel diameter increases. To understand how these changes in vessel geometry emerge from morphological changes of individual endothelial cells, we developed a novel mathematical approach that allows 3D reconstruction and quantification of both dorsal aorta geometry and endothelial cell surface morphology. Based on fluorescently marked endothelial cell contours, we inferred cross-sections of the dorsal aorta that accounted for dorsal flattening of the vessel. By projection of endothelial cell contours onto the estimated cross-sections and subsequent triangulation, we finally reconstructed 3D surfaces of the individual cells. By simultaneously reconstructing vessel cross-sections and cell surfaces, we found in an exploratory analysis that morphology varied between endothelial cells located in different sectors of the dorsal aorta in both wild-type and Endoglin-deficient zebrafish embryos: In wild-types, ventral endothelial cells were smaller and more elongated in flow direction than dorsal endothelial cells at both 48 hpf and 72 hpf. Although dorsal and ventral endothelial cells in Endoglin-deficient embryos had similar sizes at 48 hpf, dorsal endothelial cells were much larger at 72 hpf. In Endoglin-deficient embryos, elongation in flow direction increased between 48 hpf and 72 hpf in ventral endothelial cells but hardly changed in dorsal endothelial cells. Hereby, we provide evidence that dorsal endothelial cells contribute most to the disparate changes in dorsal aorta diameter in wild-type and Endoglin-deficient embryos between 48 hpf and 72 hpf.

                Background Twenty soybean genotypes were screened for Soybean yellow mosaic virus (YMV) identification which were collected from the Genetics and plant breeding farm laboratory. Methods To evaluate genetic studies of the chosen materials, the use of a net house assay upon sap inoculation made it easier to determine the trend of the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) in a controlled environment. Younger leaves from these plants were gathered and used for molecular analysis. Results Six genotypes were identified with semi-resistant disease reactions. Yellow mosaic virus-resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes were distinguished using a soybean “Rsv1-h” gene-based primer pair. To discover the existence of the Rsv-1-h gene responsible for YMV resistance, a genetic diversity panel of 15 soybean genotypes was investigated with two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The BARCSOYSSR_13_1115 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1173 primer sets were employed to validate the desired genes in these genotypes. Conclusion The genotypes HIHS-WIHS, MINA-HAI, Shohag, G-2120, BRAGG, and BS-3 presented the major gene Rsv1-h, which is said to be essential for yellow mosaic virus resistance and can provide better yield also than other genotypes. The six soybean genotypes with the Rsv1-h gene may be resistant to mosaic virus and could be exploited as a source of improved breeding material in the future.

                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. Methods In this study was used a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences, distinguishing those produced by LAB. The features were extracted using the k-mer method and vector embedding. Ten different groups were tested, combining embedding vectors and k-mers: EV, ‘EV+3-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers’, ‘EV+7-mers’, ‘EV+15-mers’, ‘EV+20-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+5-mers’, ‘EV+3-mers+7-mers’, ‘EV+5-mers+7-mers’, and ‘EV+15-mers+20-mers’. Results Five sets of 100 characteristic k-mers unique to bacteriocins produced by LAB were obtained for values of k = 3, 5, 7, 15, and 20. Significant difference was observed between using only and concatenation. Specially, ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV ’ group showed superior accuracy and loss results. Employing k-fold cross-validation with k=30, the average results for loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were 9.90%, 90.14%, 90.30%, 90.10%, and 90.10% respectively. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. The lists of characteristic k-mers pave the way to identify new bacteriocins that could be valuable for therapeutic and preventive strategies within the livestock, aquaculture industries, and potentially in human health.

                Qiao et al. investigate the rescue of mito-dysfunction from fibroblasts to adenoid cystic carcinoma by tunneling-nanotube-mediated mitochondrial transfer and permanent cell fusion. Besides rescue, cell fusion promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and exacerbates cancer cell malignancy. Both rescue processes are “selectively” driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and TMEM16F-mediated phosphatidylserine externalization, unveiling potential therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96992">Inhibition of ULK1/2 and KRASG12C controls tumor growth in preclinical models of lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Mutational activation of <i>KRAS</i> occurs commonly in lung carcinogenesis and, with the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of covalent inhibitors of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> such as sotorasib or adagrasib, KRAS oncoproteins are important pharmacological targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLCs respond to these inhibitors, and the emergence of drug resistance in those patients who do respond can be rapid and pleiotropic. Hence, based on a backbone of covalent inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, efforts are underway to develop effective combination therapies. Here, we report that the inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> signaling increases autophagy in KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-expressing lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of DCC-3116, a selective ULK1/2 inhibitor, plus sotorasib displays cooperative/synergistic suppression of human KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and superior tumor control in vivo. Additionally, in genetically engineered mouse models of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>-driven NSCLC, inhibition of either KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> or ULK1/2 decreases tumor burden and increases mouse survival. Consequently, these data suggest that ULK1/2-mediated autophagy is a pharmacologically actionable cytoprotective stress response to inhibition of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> in lung cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94698">Defining cell type-specific immune responses in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis by single-cell transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a prevalent inflammatory skin disease, is elicited upon repeated skin contact with protein-reactive chemicals through a complex and poorly characterized cellular network between immune cells and skin resident cells. Here, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the murine hapten-elicited model of ACD reveals that upon elicitation of ACD, infiltrated CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were primarily the IFNγ-producing type 1 central memory phenotype. In contrast, type 2 cytokines (IL4 and IL13) were dominantly expressed by basophils, IL17A was primarily expressed by δγ T cells, and IL1β was identified as the primary cytokine expressed by activated neutrophils/monocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, analysis of skin resident cells identified a sub-cluster of dermal fibroblasts with preadipocyte signature as a prominent target for IFNγ<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and dermal source for key T cell chemokines CXCL9/10. IFNγ treatment shifted dermal fibroblasts from collagen-producing to CXCL9/10-producing, which promoted T cell polarization toward the type-1 phenotype through a CXCR3-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, targeted deletion of <i>Ifngr1</i> in dermal fibroblasts in mice reduced <i>Cxcl9/10</i> expression, dermal infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, and alleviated ACD inflammation in mice. Finally, we showed that IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CXCL10-producing dermal fibroblasts co-enriched in the dermis of human ACD skin. Together, our results define the cell type-specific immune responses in ACD, and recognize an indispensable role of dermal fibroblasts in shaping the development of type-1 skin inflammation through the IFNGR-CXCR3 signaling circuit during ACD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97908">Adverse impact of female reproductive signaling on age-dependent neurodegeneration after mild head trauma in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Environmental insults, including mild head trauma, significantly increase the risk of neurodegeneration. However, it remains challenging to establish a causative connection between early-life exposure to mild head trauma and late-life emergence of neurodegenerative deficits, nor do we know how sex and age compound the outcome. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model, we demonstrate that exposure to mild head trauma causes neurodegenerative conditions that emerge late in life and disproportionately affect females. Increasing age-at-injury further exacerbates this effect in a sexually dimorphic manner. We further identify sex peptide signaling as a key factor in female susceptibility to post-injury brain deficits. RNA sequencing highlights a reduction in innate immune defense transcripts specifically in mated females during late life. Our findings establish a causal relationship between early head trauma and late-life neurodegeneration, emphasizing sex differences in injury response and the impact of age-at-injury. Finally, our findings reveal that reproductive signaling adversely impacts female response to mild head insults and elevates vulnerability to late-life neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">MDverse, shedding light on the dark matter of molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                The rise of open science and the absence of a global dedicated data repository for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has led to the accumulation of MD files in generalist data repositories, constituting the <i>dark matter of MD</i> — data that is technically accessible, but neither indexed, curated, or easily searchable. Leveraging an original search strategy, we found and indexed about 250,000 files and 2000 datasets from Zenodo, Figshare and Open Science Framework. With a focus on files produced by the Gromacs MD software, we illustrate the potential offered by the mining of publicly available MD data. We identified systems with specific molecular composition and were able to characterize essential parameters of MD simulation such as temperature and simulation length, and could identify model resolution, such as all-atom and coarse-grain. Based on this analysis, we inferred metadata to propose a search engine prototype to explore the MD data. To continue in this direction, we call on the community to pursue the effort of sharing MD data, and to report and standardize metadata to reuse this valuable matter.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85742">Quantitative modeling of the emergence of macroscopic grid-like representations</a></h4>

              
                When subjects navigate through spatial environments, grid cells exhibit firing fields that are arranged in a triangular grid pattern. Direct recordings of grid cells from the human brain are rare. Hence, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies proposed an indirect measure of entorhinal grid-cell activity, quantified as hexadirectional modulation of fMRI activity as a function of the subject’s movement direction. However, it remains unclear how the activity of a population of grid cells may exhibit hexadirectional modulation. Here, we use numerical simulations and analytical calculations to suggest that this hexadirectional modulation is best explained by head-direction tuning aligned to the grid axes, whereas it is not clearly supported by a bias of grid cells toward a particular phase offset. Firing-rate adaptation can result in hexadirectional modulation, but the available cellular data is insufficient to clearly support or refute this option. The magnitude of hexadirectional modulation furthermore depends considerably on the subject’s navigation pattern, indicating that future fMRI studies could be designed to test which hypothesis most likely accounts for the fMRI measure of grid cells. Our findings also underline the importance of quantifying the properties of human grid cells to further elucidate how hexadirectional modulations of fMRI activity may emerge.

">Creating anatomically-derived, standardized, customizable, and three-dimensional printable head caps for functional neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Consistent and accurate probe placement is a crucial step towards enhancing the reproducibility of longitudinal and group-based functional neuroimaging studies. While the selection of head gear is central to these efforts, there does not currently exist a standardized design that can accommodate diverse probe configurations and experimental procedures. Aim: We aim to provide the community with an open-source software pipeline for conveniently creating low-cost, 3-D printable neuroimaging head caps with anatomically significant landmarks integrated into the structure of the cap. Approach: We utilize our advanced 3-D head mesh generation toolbox and 10-20 head landmark calculations to quickly convert a subject's anatomical scan or an atlas into a 3-D printable head cap model. The 3-D modeling environment of the open-source Blender platform permits advanced mesh processing features to customize the cap. The design process is streamlined into a Blender add-on named "NeuroCaptain". Results: Using the intuitive user interface, we create various head cap models using brain atlases, and share those with the community. The resulting mesh-based head cap designs are readily 3-D printable using off-the-shelf printers and filaments while accurately preserving the head topology and landmarks. Conclusions: The methods developed in this work result in a widely accessible tool for community members to design, customize and fabricate caps that incorporate anatomically derived landmarks. This not only permits personalized head cap designs to achieve improved accuracy, but also offers an open platform for the community to propose standardizable head caps to facilitate multi-centered data collection and sharing.

">Anatomical Abnormalities Suggest a Compensatory Role of the Cerebellum in Early Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Brain atrophy is detected in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and accelerates over the first few years post-diagnosis. This was captured by multiple cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies in early PD. Yet only a longitudinal study with a control group can capture accelerated atrophy in early PD and differentiate it from healthy ageing. Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2-3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2-3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls - but not PD patients - demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX. Our results highlight an initial increase in cerebellar WM volume during prodromal PD, followed by significant degeneration over the first few years post-diagnosis.

">Is it me or the train moving? Humans resolve sensory conflicts with a nonlinear feedback mechanism in balance control</a></h4>

              
                Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. The sensory contributions change depending on context and environmental conditions. These changes are typically attributed to 'reweighting' by some higher order mechanism. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that combines 1) sensory inputs with fixed weights and 2) multisensory corrections, if the reference of the sensory inputs move in space and are therefore unreliable. This reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) allows humans to use vision and automatically counteract erroneous inputs, e.g. when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead-zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for changes in sensory contributions. Secondly, we hypothesized that such a nonlinearity would distort balance responses to perturbations in a very specific way. We predicted such distortions in body sway using a balance control model. Experiments using visual scene movements as a specific implementation of RFMs confirmed the predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.

">Novel iGluSnFR3 variants with improved kinetics and dynamic range for tracking high frequency firing at glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                The first genetically encoded single fluorescent protein-based glutamate sensor, iGluSnFR opened a new era of imaging neuronal activity at the level of circuits as well as at synapses. With slow off-kinetics, iGluSnFR could only resolve low frequency glutamate release. A binding site variant of iGluSnFR, iGluu with significantly faster off-kinetics, enabled the resolution of high (100 Hz) frequency glutamate release in hippocampal slices at individual CA3-CA1 synapses. Moreover, iGluu revealed impairment of glutamate retrieval in HD mice models pointing to defective glutamate transport. Recently, the iGluSnFR3 generation (SF-Venus-iGluSnFR. v857) has been developed with increased dynamic range and rapid on-kinetics, making it attractive for in vivo imaging. However, similarly to iGluSnFR, glutamate off-kinetics of iGluSnFR3 were predicted to limit it to resolving low frequency release only. We undertook to improve the kinetic properties of iGluSnFR3 for resolving high (100 Hz) frequency glutamate release. We generated and characterized iGlu3fast, an ultrafast decay variant of iGluSnFR3. For iGlu3Fast we obtained a decay rate constant of 340 s-1, ~5-fold faster than iGluSnFR3 at 71 s-1, at 20oC. Furthermore, iGlu3Fast superseded iGluSnFR3 with a 42-fold glutamate-induced fluorescence increase compared to 26 for iGluSnFR3. Thus, with rapid off-kinetics comparable to that of iGluu as well as significantly increased fluorescence dynamic range and preserved rapid on-kinetics, iGlu3fast represents an excellent novel sensor for imaging high frequency glutamate release at all levels of organisation. Two novel variants with superslow off-kinetics are also reported, expanding the range of applications in neurobiology.

">Computational Modeling shows Confirmation Bias during Formation and Revision of Self-Beliefs</a></h4>

              
                Self-belief formation and revision strongly depend on social feedback. Accordingly, self-beliefs are subject to (re)evaluation and updating when facing new information. However, it has been shown that self-related learning is rarely purely information-driven. Instead, self-related learning is susceptible to a wide variety of biases. Among them is the confirmation bias, which can render updating insufficient, leading to inaccurate self-beliefs. To better understand these biases, it is important to delineate the effects of initial expectations towards the self and the confidence associated with the self-belief. In a novel behavioral approach, we introduced two learning phases during which participants completed an estimation task and received feedback allegedly related to their performance. In the first session (T1), participants established beliefs about their abilities in this task based on trial-by-trial feedback. In the second session (T2), participants received feedback that differed substantially from the feedback they had received at T1, thus creating the possibility for belief revision. Computational modeling was used to describe initial belief formation and later revision. The results showed confirmatory belief updating behavior on different levels: Participants did not, on average, revise their beliefs at T2, although they were constantly confronted with conflicting evidence. Instead, we observed that initial expectations were linked to biased learning from the received feedback, even at the beginning of the initial belief formation phase. Further, higher confidence in the beliefs was associated with attenuated revision. Together, the results underline the importance of individual priors when delineating learning biases.

">Heart Rate Variability During REM Sleep is Associated with Reduced Negative Memory Bias</a></h4>

              
                Emotional memories change over time, but the mechanisms supporting this change are not well understood. Memory consolidation during sleep has been shown to selectively prioritize negative experiences while forgetting neutral memories. Whereas studies examining the role of vagal heart rate variability (HRV) during waking in memory consolidation have shown that vagal HRV is associated with enhanced memory of positive experiences at the expense of negative ones. However, no studies have explored how HRV during sleep contributes to emotional memory processing. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the neural and vagal contributions during sleep to the processing of neutral and negative memories. To do so, we examined the impact of pharmacological vagal suppression, using zolpidem, on overnight emotional memory consolidation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design. Thirty-two participants encoded neutral and negative pictures in the morning, then were tested on picture recognition before and after a night of sleep. Zolpidem or a placebo drug were administered in the evening before overnight sleep, monitored with electroencephalography and electrocardiography. Results showed that higher vagal HRV in Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep slow wave sleep (NREM SWS) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM) was associated with greater overnight improvement for neutral pictures in the placebo condition. Additionally, higher vagal HRV during REM was associated with an emotional memory tradeoff (i.e., greater memory for neutral at the expense of negative images), indicating a potential role for REM vagal HRV in forming a positive memory bias overnight. As previously reported, zolpidem reduced vagal HRV during SWS and increased NREM sigma power, and this vagal suppression eliminated the positive memory bias. Lastly, we used a stepwise linear mixed effects regression framework to investigate how NREM sigma power and vagal HRV during REM independently explained the variance in the emotional memory tradeoff effect and found that including vagal HRV significantly improved the model's fit. Overall, these results suggest that neural and vagal signals synergistically interact in the processing of emotional memories, with REM vagal HRV playing a specific role in contributing to the positive memory bias.

">Human deep sleep facilitates faster cerebrospinal fluid dynamics linked to brain oscillations for sleep homeostasis and memory</a></h4>

              
                While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics during sleep have been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the human brain remains elusive. Here, by leveraging a simultaneous sparse-fMRI and polysomnography method designed specifically for acquiring deep stable sleep data, we present the first evidence of deep sleep-specific faster CSF dynamics in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induce frequent low-amplitude CSF fluctuations, contributing to faster CSF dynamics during deep sleep. In contrast, arousal-related brain activities during light sleep produced infrequent large CSF changes. Furthermore, these brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruited essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep emphasizing memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of enabling faster CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.

">Predicting the irrelevant: Neural effects of distractor predictability depend on load</a></h4>

              
                Distraction is ubiquitous in human environments. Distracting input is often predictable, but we do not understand whether and under which circumstances humans form and employ predictions about the identity of an expected distractor. Here we ask whether predictable distractors are able to reduce uncertainty in updating the internal predictive model. We show that utilising a predictable distractor identity is not fully automatic but in part dependent on available resources. In an auditory spatial n-back task, listeners (n = 33) attended to spoken numbers presented to one ear and detected repeating items. Distracting numbers presented to the other ear either followed a predictable (i.e., repetitive) sequence or were unpredictable. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to uncover neural responses to predictable versus unpredictable auditory distractors, as well as their dependence on perceptual and cognitive load. Neurally, unpredictable distractors induced a sign-reversed lateralization of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) and larger amplitude of the stimulus-evoked P2 event-related potential component. Under low versus high memory load, distractor predictability increased the magnitude of the frontal negativity component. Behaviourally, predictable distractors under low task demands (i.e., good signal-to-noise ratio and low memory load) made participants adopt a less conservative (i.e., more optimal) response strategy. We conclude that predictable distractors decrease uncertainty and reduce the need for updating the internal predictive model. In turn, unpredictable distractors mislead proactive spatial attention orientation, elicit larger neural responses and put higher demand on memory.

	<p>It is challenging to differentiate between central nervous system (CNS) virus infections and neurological autoimmune diseases in the emergency department. Considering their different pathogenesis, we assume they differ in neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. A total of 80 patients were included in this study, 50 with CNS virus infections and 30 with CNS autoimmune diseases, confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A binary logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were employed to examine the discrimination between the two types of diseases based on neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory results. Compared to patients with neurological autoimmune diseases, patients with CNS virus infections had a higher incidence of abnormal behavior (p = 0.026) and abnormal sensation/thought (p = 0.029); higher total (p = 0.005), direct (p = 0.004), and indirect bilirubin (p = 0.004); and increased CSF cell (p = 0.01) and CSF white cell counts (p = 0.01). Patients with disturbance of consciousness and abnormal sensation/thought were 7.79-fold and 5.07-fold more likely to be diagnosed with CNS virus infections (OR = 7.79, p = 0.008; OR = 5.07, p = 0.032). Each unit increase in blood indirect bilirubin concentration and CSF white cell counts increased the risk of developing CNS virus infections by 1.25-fold and 1.01-fold (OR = 1.25, p = 0.016; OR = 1.01, p = 0.011). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 88.0% (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Our study found that patients with CNS viral infections tend to have higher blood indirect bilirubin concentration, CSF leukocyte count, frequency of disorders of consciousness, and abnormal sensation and thought, which may help differentiate them from those with neurological autoimmune diseases.</p>

	<p>Background. Incidentally discovered low-grade gliomas (iLGGs) are very rare and little is still known about their associated functional imaging activation patterns, white-matter status, and plasticity potential. Recent studies shed light on several clinical factors responsible for the good clinical status observed in these patients versus those with their symptomatic counterpart (sLGGs), including small volume. Comparisons were typically carried out by comparing iLGGs with the wider and more heterogeneous sLGG group. In this study, we investigated whether iLGGs affect the brain differently from comparably small sLGGs. Method. Starting from a sample of 13 patients with iLGG, in the current comparative cross-sectional study, we identified a group of patients with sLGGs, primarily matched by lesion volume. We looked for potential differences between the two groups in language-related functional and structural parameters (the fMRI network associated with naming and white-matter fascicles). Results. The t-test did not show significant differences in the fMRI network, but these emerged when performing masking. No significant differences were observed at the white-matter level. Conclusions. Given that small volumes characterized both groups and that demographic variables were comparable, too, we hypothesized that differences between the two groups could be attributed to alternative lesion-related parameters. We discussed these findings from clinical and neurosurgical perspectives.</p>

	<p>Subinsular stroke (subIS) can occur between the penetrating middle cerebral artery (MCA) branches, which clinical and radiological findings sometimes encounter in patients after the recanalization of left proximal MCA occlusion. However, no supportive data are available to clarify this relationship. This study investigated whether the involvement of subIS can impact outcomes after successful reperfusion therapy. Data from 152 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy between 2019 and 2023 were collected. A 3-month functional independence defined as a modified Rankin Scale 0&amp;amp;ndash;2 (primary outcome) and influencing factors were analyzed retrospectively. Recanalization was achieved in 35 patients, of whom 11 (31%) developed subIS. Patients with subIS were older in age (81 vs. 75; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), had lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on admission (0.52 vs. 0.62; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (4 vs. 2; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than those without subIS. In a multivariate analysis, subIS was independently associated with a worse functional outcome (odds ratio: 10.5, p = 0.02). The cut-off value of the ADCs was 0.52 with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 64%, respectively. Subinsular ischemic lesions contribute to poor functional independence in patients after the successful recanalization of left MCA occlusion. The attenuation of the ADC value in these territories could be a valuable predictor of the outcome.</p>

	<p>Background: Road safety improvement is a governmental priority due to driver-caused accidents. Driving style variation affects safety, with emotional regulation being pivotal. However, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies show inconsistent prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing. This study examines prefrontal cortex response to negative emotional stimuli, particularly traffic accident images, across drivers diverse in age and gender. Method: The study involved 118 healthy males (44.38 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.98 years) and 84 females (38.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.60 years). The Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI) was used to assess driving behavior alongside fNIRS recordings. Participants viewed traffic accident and neutral images while prefrontal oxygenation was monitored. Results: Women rated traffic accidents (t-test = 2.43; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.016) and neutral images (t-test = 2.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030) lower in valence than men. Arousal differences were significant for traffic accident images (t-test = &amp;amp;minus;3.06; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002). correlational analysis found an inverse relationship between Dissociative scale scores and oxygenation (all p-values &amp;amp;le; 0.013). Greater prefrontal oxygenation occurred with neutral images compared to traffic accidents. Left hemisphere differences (t-test = 3.23; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) exceeded right hemisphere differences (t-test = 2.46; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.015). Subgroup analysis showed male participants to be driving these disparities. Among adaptive drivers, significant oxygenation differences between neutral and accident images were evident in both hemispheres (left: t-test = 2.72, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.009; right: t-test = 2.22, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.030). Conclusions: Male drivers with maladaptive driving styles, particularly dissociative ones, exhibit reduced prefrontal oxygenation when exposed to neutral and traffic accident images. This response was absent in female drivers, with no notable age-related differences.</p>

	<p>Hypnotic phenomena exhibit significant inter-individual variability, with some individuals consistently demonstrating efficient responses to hypnotic suggestions, while others show limited susceptibility. Recent neurophysiological studies have added to a growing body of research that shows variability in hypnotic susceptibility is linked to distinct neural characteristics. Building on this foundation, our previous work identified that individuals with high and low hypnotic susceptibility can be differentiated based on the arrhythmic activity observed in resting-state electrophysiology (rs-EEG) outside of hypnosis. However, because previous work has largely focused on mean spectral characteristics, our understanding of the variability over time of these features, and how they relate to hypnotic susceptibility, is still limited. Here we address this gap using a time-resolved assessment of rhythmic alpha peaks and arrhythmic components of the EEG spectrum both prior to and following hypnotic induction. Using multivariate pattern classification, we investigated whether these neural features differ between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis. Specifically, we used multivariate pattern classification to investigate whether these non-stationary neural features could distinguish between individuals with high and low susceptibility to hypnosis before and after a hypnotic induction. Our analytical approach focused on time-resolved spectral decomposition to capture the intricate dynamics of neural oscillations and their non-oscillatory counterpart, as well as Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity. Our results show that variations in the alpha center frequency are indicative of hypnotic susceptibility, but this discrimination is only evident during hypnosis. Highly hypnotic-susceptible individuals exhibit higher variability in alpha peak center frequency. These findings underscore how dynamic changes in neural states related to alpha peak frequency represent a central neurophysiological feature of hypnosis and hypnotic susceptibility.</p>

	<p>Rapid identification of the type and origin of a stroke is crucial for prompt and appropriate treatment, which can significantly influences patient outcomes. We report a multidisciplinary management case involving a 76-year-old man who presented with left-sided weakness and mild dysarthria. Imaging revealed a completely occluded right internal carotid artery. Despite multiple endovascular recanalization attempts, adequate flow could not be achieved, leading to the decision to perform an open thrombo-endarterectomy. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy with microsurgical techniques under general anesthesia. The atheroma plaque and central thrombus were removed, which reestablished flow. Continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring was utilized to ensure patient safety. The patient woke up without new deficits and was discharged for rehabilitation. Follow-up imaging confirmed arterial patency, and the patient eventually made an excellent recovery, including being independent over one and a half years. Emergent recanalization with carotid endarterectomy following a failed endovascular recanalization is both safe and feasible, emphasizing the need for collaboration between different treatment providers to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Our report highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the advantages of a hybrid operating room in the treatment of acute complete carotid artery occlusion.</p>

	<p>Sigma-1R (S1R) is a ubiquitously distributed protein highly expressed in the brain and liver. It acts as a ligand-inducible chaperone protein localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. S1R participates in several signaling pathways that oversee diverse cellular and neurological functions, such as calcium and proteome homeostasis, neuronal activity, memory, and emotional regulation. Despite its crucial functions, S1R expression profile in the brain with respect to age and sex remains elusive. To shed light on this matter, we assessed S1R distribution in the mouse brain across different developmental stages, including juvenile, early adult, and middle-aged mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that S1R is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus in juvenile mice, particularly in CA1 and CA3 regions. Notably, S1R is not expressed in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus of juvenile mice. We observed dynamic changes in S1R levels during development, with most brain regions showing either an abrupt or gradual decline as mice transition from juveniles to adults. Sexual dimorphism is observed before puberty in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and during adulthood in the hippocampus and cortex.</p>

	<p>Accurate and generalizable classification of brain states is essential for understanding their neural underpinnings and improving clinical diagnostics. Traditionally, functional connectivity patterns and graph-theoretic metrics have been utilized. However, cortical gradient features, which reflect global brain organization, offer a complementary approach. We hypothesized that a machine learning model integrating these three feature sets would effectively discriminate between baseline and atypical brain states across a wide spectrum of conditions, even though the underlying neural mechanisms vary. To test this, we extracted features from brain states associated with three meta-conditions including unconsciousness (NREM2 sleep, propofol deep sedation, and propofol general anesthesia), psychedelic states induced by hallucinogens (subanesthetic ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, and nitrous oxide), and neuropsychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia). We used support vector machine with nested cross-validation to construct our models. The soft voting ensemble model marked the average balanced accuracy (average of specificity and sensitivity) of 79% (62&amp;amp;ndash;98% across all conditions), outperforming individual base models (70&amp;amp;ndash;76%). Notably, our models exhibited varying degrees of transferability across different datasets, with performance being dependent on the specific brain states and feature sets used. Feature importance analysis across meta-conditions suggests that the underlying neural mechanisms vary significantly, necessitating tailored approaches for accurate classification of specific brain states. This finding underscores the value of our feature-integrated ensemble models, which leverage the strengths of multiple feature types to achieve robust performance across a broader range of brain states. While our approach offers valuable insights into the neural signatures of different brain states, future work is needed to develop and validate even more generalizable models that can accurately classify brain states across a wider array of conditions.</p>

	<p>This retrospective study assesses the efficacy and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (anti-CGRP) therapy in adolescents and young adults (ages 12&amp;amp;ndash;21) with migraine and chronic daily headaches unresponsive to standard treatments. Migraines in this demographic significantly impair school performance, self-esteem, psychological well-being, and cognitive health. These young patients are also particularly sensitive to the side effects of conventional medications, which are often prescribed off-label and come with high insurance denial rates. Medication overuse, including analgesics, triptans, and NSAIDs, is prevalent due to treatment failures. Elevated plasma CGRP levels observed during migraines suggest that anti-CGRP therapies, successful in adult populations, may also benefit this younger age group. Over a three-year period, patients at a specialized pediatric headache center were evaluated for the impact of anti-CGRP treatments, including monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) and small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists (ubrogepant, rimegepant, and atogepant), administered either alone or in combination with OnabotulinumtoxinA. Data were extracted from the hospital&amp;amp;rsquo;s electronic medical records, and patient progress was consistently documented using a structured template for each clinic visit. Additional patient satisfaction data were collected via telephone follow-ups and patient message reviews. The study included 23 patients, primarily treated for chronic migraine (CM) (78.3%), with a smaller subset addressing episodic migraine (EM), new daily persistent headaches (NDPHs), and post-traumatic headaches (PTHs). Comprehensive demographic and clinical data, including age, treatment duration, history of preventive treatment failures, and comorbidities like psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders, were collected. Anti-CGRP therapies, particularly when combined with traditional treatments or OnabotulinumtoxinA, resulted in significant improvements: 91.3% of patients experienced reduced migraine duration and intensity, 82.6% reported improvements in other bothersome symptoms, and 73.9% saw an improved response to rescue medications. Additionally, 78.3% of patients reported a reduction in their use of rescue medications per week by more than 50%, and emergency room visits were reduced for 56.5% of patients. Significant reductions in headache days were observed in 82.6% of patients after one month and 87% after three months, with nearly 40% experiencing more than a 50% reduction in both periods. The greatest benefits were observed in patients treated for more than six months. Adverse effects were minimal, with 95.7% of patients reporting no side effects, and patient satisfaction was high, with 69.6% opting to continue treatment. Overall, this study highlights the substantial potential of anti-CGRP therapy in improving outcomes for adolescents and young adults with CM and EM, offering a promising approach for a demographic that faces considerable challenges with conventional treatment options. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and expand clinical applications in this age group.</p>

                <p>Peak-alpha frequency varies across individuals and mental states, but it also forms a negative gradient from posterior to anterior regions in association with increases in cortical thickness and connectivity, reflecting a cortical hierarchy in temporal integration. Tracking the spatial standard deviation of peak-alpha frequency in scalp EEG, we observed that a posterior-to-anterior gradient dynamically formed and dissolved. Periods of high spatial standard deviation yielded robustly negative posterior-to-anterior gradients&mdash;the "gradient state"&mdash;while periods of low spatial standard deviation yielded globally converged peak-alpha frequency&mdash;the "uniform state." The state variations were characterized by a combination of slow (0.3&ndash;0.5&nbsp;Hz) oscillations and random-walk-like fluctuations. They were relatively independently correlated with peak-alpha frequency variations in anterior regions and peak-alpha power variations in central regions driven by posterior regions (together accounting for ~50% of the state variations), suggesting that two distinct mechanisms modulate the state variations: an anterior mechanism that directly adjusts peak-alpha frequencies and a posterior&ndash;central mechanism that indirectly adjusts them by influencing synchronization. The state variations likely reflect general operations as their spatiotemporal characteristics remained unchanged while participants engaged in a variety of tasks (breath focus, vigilance, working memory, mental arithmetic, and generative thinking) with their eyes closed or watched a silent nature video. The ongoing state variations may dynamically balance two global processing modes, one that facilitates greater temporal integration (and potentially also information influx) toward anterior regions in the gradient state and the other that facilitates flexible global communication (via phase locking) in the uniform state.</p>

                <p>Adolescent inhibition of thalamocortical projections from postnatal days P20 to 50 leads to long-lasting deficits in prefrontal cortex function and cognition in the adult mouse. While this suggests a role of thalamic activity in prefrontal cortex maturation, it is unclear how inhibition of these projections affects prefrontal circuitry during adolescence. Here, we used chemogenetic tools to inhibit thalamoprefrontal projections in male/female mice from P20 to P35 and measured synaptic inputs to prefrontal pyramidal neurons by layer (either II/III or V/VI) and projection target (mediodorsal thalamus (MD), nucleus accumbens (NAc), or callosal prefrontal projections) 24&nbsp;h later using slice physiology. We found a decrease in the frequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents in layer II/III NAc and layer V/VI MD-projecting neurons while layer V/VI NAc-projecting neurons showed an increase in the amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Regarding cortical projections, the frequency of inhibitory but not excitatory currents was enhanced in contralateral mPFC-projecting neurons. Notably, despite these complex changes in individual levels of excitation and inhibition, the overall balance between excitation and inhibition in each cell was only altered in the contralateral mPFC projections. This finding suggests homeostatic regulation occurs within subcortically but not intracortical callosal-projecting neurons. Increased inhibition of intraprefrontal connectivity may therefore be particularly important for prefrontal cortex circuit maturation. Finally, we observed cognitive deficits in the adult mouse using this narrowed window of thalamocortical inhibition.</p>

                <p>Volatile anesthetics are currently believed to cause unconsciousness by acting on one or more molecular targets including neural ion channels, receptors, mitochondria, synaptic proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. Anesthetic gases including isoflurane bind to cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) and dampen their quantum optical effects, potentially contributing to causing unconsciousness. This possibility is supported by the finding that taxane chemotherapy consisting of MT-stabilizing drugs reduces the effectiveness of anesthesia during surgery in human cancer patients. In order to experimentally assess the contribution of MTs as functionally relevant targets of volatile anesthetics, we measured latencies to loss of righting reflex (LORR) under 4% isoflurane in male rats injected subcutaneously with vehicle or 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg of the brain-penetrant MT&ndash;stabilizing drug epothilone B (epoB). EpoB-treated rats took an average of 69&nbsp;s longer to become unconscious as measured by latency to LORR. This was a statistically significant difference corresponding to a standardized mean difference (Cohen's <I>d</I>) of 1.9, indicating a "large" normalized effect size. The effect could not be accounted for by tolerance from repeated exposure to isoflurane. Our results suggest that binding of the anesthetic gas isoflurane to MTs causes unconsciousness and loss of purposeful behavior in rats (and presumably humans and other animals). This finding is predicted by models that posit consciousness as a property of a quantum physical state of neural MTs.</p>

                <p>Uncovering the relationships between neural circuits, behavior, and neural dysfunction may require rodent pose tracking. While open-source toolkits such as DeepLabCut have revolutionized markerless pose estimation using deep neural networks, the training process still requires human intervention for annotating key points of interest in video data. To further reduce human labor for neural network training, we developed a method that automatically generates annotated image datasets of rodent paw placement in a laboratory setting. It uses invisible but fluorescent markers that become temporarily visible under UV light. Through stroboscopic alternating illumination, adjacent video frames taken at 720&nbsp;Hz are either UV or white light illuminated. After color filtering the UV-exposed video frames, the UV markings are identified and the paw locations are deterministically mapped. This paw information is then transferred to automatically annotate paw positions in the next white light-exposed frame that is later used for training the neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a KineWheel&ndash;DeepLabCut setup for the markerless tracking of the four paws of a harness-fixed mouse running on top of the transparent wheel with mirror. Our automated approach, made available open-source, achieves high-quality position annotations and significantly reduces the need for human involvement in the neural network training process, paving the way for more efficient and streamlined rodent pose tracking in neuroscience research.</p>

                Background Most stroke survivors consider community ambulation an essential but unmet goal of their recovery. Historically, interventions to enhance community ambulation have focused on improving biomechanical impairments of gait; however, recent evidence suggests that biopsychosocial and environmental factors may impact community ambulation, even beyond more obvious physical impairments. The identification of factors that pose as significant facilitators or barriers to community ambulation may serve to guide stakeholders in designing relevant and evidence-based interventions for improving community ambulation post-stroke. Objective This review aims to map the type and extent of existing evidence on the physical, biopsychosocial, and environmental factors affecting community ambulation post-stroke. Additionally, this review will describe the various methods used to examine the extent to which stroke survivors are restricted to community ambulation. Methods Nine databases will be searched including CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science. We will include studies published in English during or after 2001. Studies that examine physical, biopsychosocial, and/or environmental factors affecting community ambulation in ambulatory adults at least six months post-stroke will be considered for inclusion. Studies that assess general physical activity or community mobility through transportation modes other than walking will be excluded. All identified records will be collated in citation management software, followed by steps of deduplication, title/abstract screening, and full-text reviews by at least two independent reviewers. The bibliographies of the extracted studies will also be reviewed for relevant articles. The extracted studies will be analyzed, critically appraised, and presented in tabular, narrative, and evidence map formats. Discussion The evidence gained will be used to build a framework for community ambulation, informing stakeholders to develop meaningful interventions to improve community ambulation. The mapped evidence will motivate future studies to develop holistic approaches that specifically focus on the most vital factors that influence post-stroke community ambulation.

                Background Activation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ECOG at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from hypercoagulable states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance and anticoagulant treatment for these patients.

                This research shows that ongoing digital changes have a significant impact, particularly in the government sector. In addition to ease and benefits, such as operational efficiency and faster public services, new challenges, such as problems related to system integration, human resources (HR) limitations in the use of technology, and public access to digital technology, are also present. Therefore, this study aims to explore the role of interpersonal communication in enhancing employee performance in the context of HR development in the digital era by employing the systematic literature review (SLR) method and using data from electronic databases, specifically Google Scholar using the Harsing’s Publish or Perish (Windows GUI Edition) 8.2.3944.8118, the application can be accessed by downloading (https://publish-or-perish.en.softonic.com/), and Scopus (www.scopus.com) with a focus on journals published between 2017 and 2024. By identifying research gaps, research questions were developed to understand the influence of interpersonal communication on improving employee performance in the context of public services, necessary adaptations, and interpersonal communication strategies. This research provides comprehensive insights and practical solutions for the government sector to address the dynamics of the current and future digital era, based on data analysis from reliable database sources. The risk of bias in this study was addressed through the selection criteria and data extraction method. Thematic analysis and quantitative summarization were used for data presentation and synthesis. The results of the meta-analysis indicate that interpersonal communication has a significant positive influence on employee performance. The effect size estimates for each intervention and the corresponding confidence intervals are presented. To ensure honesty and accuracy in the interpretation of the results, potential evidence limitations and biases should be acknowledged transparently.

                The debate on tuition-free higher education has raged in South Africa since the #FeesMustFall protests at South African universities in 2015 and 2016. The government responded with a tuition-free education policy targeting students from households earning less than R350 000. However, the question remains can South Africa sustain a tuition-free education policy given its developing nation status and the levels of its GDP? This article sought to assess the feasibility of tuition-free higher education for all in South Africa. A scoping review was used, and fifteen articles about tuition-free higher education feasibility in South Africa were reviewed. The choice of the scoping review was due to the need for an understanding of the current state of play in research on the feasibility of tuition-free higher education in South Africa. The results suggest that tuition-free higher education for all is not feasible in South Africa. There seems to be a consensus that South Africa lacks the resources to finance tuition-free higher education for all. Tuition-free higher education is also viewed as a regressive tax on the poor given that the majority of students in higher education institutions come from middle and upper-income households. However, it is important to note that a distinction is drawn between tuition-free higher education for all and tuition-free higher education for the poor and academically deserving. The latter seems to receive support with some viewing it as a moral imperative in an unequal society such as South Africa’s. It is recommended that future studies approach the issue from an empirical standpoint whereby the GDP levels are assessed against higher education funding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-780/v2?src=rss">Evaluating the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa: a causal loop diagram approach  [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This research investigated the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, aiming to elucidate the complexities surrounding its implementation and impact. By employing a causal loop diagram approach, the study examined the interplay of socioeconomic, political, and institutional factors influencing the provision of fee-free higher education. Method A participatory approach to developing the CLD was used. Through an extensive literature review, the research contextualised fee-free higher education enabling a preliminary CLD to be developed. Discussions were held to improve the preliminary model based on stakeholder and expert opinion. The model was then validated by stakeholders and experts. Results The CLD has explicitly mapped out the causal relationships which play a fundamental role in fee-free higher education in South Africa. Key findings revealed that fee-free higher education initiatives, such as managing funding constraints and administrative complexities, hold promise for fostering inclusivity and socioeconomic development but are hindered by bureaucratic policy establishments and inefficiencies. These challenges underscore the gap between policy formulation and implementation, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms to streamline administrative processes and enhance financial sustainability within the higher education sector. Conclusion This research thoroughly examined the dynamics of fee-free higher education in South Africa, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities in its implementation. The study emphasized the need for systemic reforms to improve accessibility and effectiveness, while also underscoring the potential of such initiatives to promote social mobility and economic empowerment, aligning with global goals like the SDGs and the African Agenda 2063.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

Background <p>The grim (<10% 5-year) survival rates for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are attributed to its complex intrinsic biology and most often late-stage detection. The overlap of symptoms with benign gastrointestinal conditions in early stage further complicates timely detection. The suboptimal diagnostic performance of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19–9 and elevation in benign hyperbilirubinaemia undermine its reliability, leaving a notable absence of accurate diagnostic biomarkers. Using a selected patient cohort with benign pancreatic and biliary tract conditions we aimed to develop a data analysis protocol leading to a biomarker signature capable of distinguishing patients with non-specific yet concerning clinical presentations, from those with PDAC.</p> Methods <p>539 patient serum samples collected under the Accelerated Diagnosis of neuro Endocrine and Pancreatic TumourS (ADEPTS) study (benign disease controls and PDACs) and the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS, healthy controls) were screened using the Olink Oncology II panel, supplemented with five in-house markers. 16 specialized base-learner classifiers were stacked to select and enhance biomarker performances and robustness in blinded samples. Each base-learner was constructed through cross-validation and recursive feature elimination in a discovery set comprising approximately two thirds of the ADEPTS and UKCTOCS samples and contrasted specific diagnosis with PDAC.</p> Results <p>The signature which was developed using diagnosis-specific ensemble learning demonstrated predictive capabilities outperforming CA19-9, the only biomarker currently accepted by the FDA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for pancreatic cancer, and other individual biomarkers and combinations in both discovery and held-out validation sets. An AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99) and sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1) at 90% specificity was achieved with the ensemble method, which was significantly larger than the AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66–0.91) and sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.50–0.83), also at 90% specificity, for CA19-9, in the discovery set (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.00050, respectively). During ensemble signature validation in the held-out set, an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.99), sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI 0.68–1), was attained compared to an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.93), sensitivity 0.65 (95% CI 0.48–0.56) at 90% specificity for CA19-9 alone (p = 0.0082 and p = 0.024, respectively). When validated only on the benign disease controls and PDACs collected from ADEPTS, the diagnostic-specific signature achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI 0.64–0.95) at 90% specificity, which was still significantly higher than the performance for CA19-9 taken as a single predictor, AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.64–0.93) and sensitivity of 0.18 (95% CI 0.03–0.69) (p = 0.013 and p = 0.0055, respectively).</p> Conclusion <p>Our ensemble modelling technique outperformed CA19-9, individual biomarkers and indices developed with prevailing algorithms in distinguishing patients with non-specific but concerning symptoms from those with PDAC, with implications for improving its early detection in individuals at risk.</p>

Mobile genetic elements shape microbial gene repertoires and populations. Recent results reveal that many, possibly most, microbial mobile genetic elements require helpers to transfer between genomes, which we refer to as Hitcher Genetic Elements (hitchers or HGEs). They may be a large fraction of pathogenicity and resistance genomic islands, whose mechanisms of transfer have remained enigmatic for decades. Together with their helper elements and their bacterial hosts, hitchers form tripartite networks of interactions that evolve rapidly within a parasitism–mutualism continuum. In this emerging view of microbial genomes as communities of mobile genetic elements many questions arise. Which elements are being moved, by whom, and how? How often are hitchers costly hyper-parasites or beneficial mutualists? What is the evolutionary origin of hitchers? Are there key advantages associated with hitchers’ lifestyle that justify their unexpected abundance? And why are hitchers systematically smaller than their helpers? In this essay, we start answering these questions and point ways ahead for understanding the principles, origin, mechanisms, and impact of hitchers in bacterial ecology and evolution.

The widespread sharing of information on the Internet has given rise to ecological studies that use data from digital sources including digitized museum records and social media posts. Most of these studies have focused on understanding species occurrences and distributions. In this essay, we argue that data from digital sources also offer many opportunities to study animal behavior including long-term and large-scale comparisons within and between species. Following Nikko Tinbergen’s classical roadmap for behavioral investigation, we show how using videos, photos, text, and audio posted on social media and other digital platforms can shed new light on known behaviors, particularly in a changing world, and lead to the discovery of new ones.

While extinction risk categorization is fundamental for building robust conservation planning for marine fishes, empirical data on occurrence and vulnerability to disturbances are still lacking for most marine teleost fish species, preventing the assessment of their International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status. In this article, we predicted the IUCN status of marine fishes based on two machine learning algorithms, trained with available species occurrences, biological traits, taxonomy, and human uses. We found that extinction risk for marine fish species is higher than initially estimated by the IUCN, increasing from 2.5% to 12.7%. Species predicted as Threatened were mainly characterized by a small geographic range, a relatively large body size, and a low growth rate. Hotspots of predicted Threatened species peaked mainly in the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea, the Celebes Sea, the west coast Australia and North America. We also explored the consequences of including these predicted species’ IUCN status in the prioritization of marine protected areas through conservation planning. We found a marked increase in prioritization ranks for subpolar and polar regions despite their low species richness. We suggest to integrate multifactorial ensemble learning to assess species extinction risk and offer a more complete view of endangered taxonomic groups to ultimately reach global conservation targets like the extending coverage of protected areas where species are the most vulnerable.

The chelicerate body plan is distinguished from other arthropod groups by its division of segments into 2 tagmata: the anterior prosoma (“cephalothorax”) and the posterior opisthosoma (“abdomen”). Little is understood about the genetic mechanisms that establish the prosomal-opisthosomal (PO) boundary. To discover these mechanisms, we created high-quality genomic resources for the large-bodied spider <i>Aphonopelma hentzi</i>. We sequenced specific territories along the antero-posterior axis of developing embryos and applied differential gene expression analyses to identify putative regulators of regional identity. After bioinformatic screening for candidate genes that were consistently highly expressed in only 1 tagma (either the prosoma or the opisthosoma), we validated the function of highly ranked candidates in the tractable spider model <i>Parasteatoda tepidariorum</i>. Here, we show that an arthropod homolog of the Iroquois complex of homeobox genes is required for proper formation of the boundary between arachnid tagmata. The function of this homolog had not been previously characterized, because it was lost in the common ancestor of Pancrustacea, precluding its investigation in well-studied insect model organisms. Knockdown of the spider copy of this gene, which we designate as <i>waist-less</i>, in <i>P</i>. <i>tepidariorum</i> resulted in embryos with defects in the PO boundary, incurring discontinuous spider germ bands. We show that <i>waist-less</i> is required for proper specification of the segments that span the prosoma-opisthosoma boundary, which in adult spiders corresponds to the narrowed pedicel. Our results demonstrate the requirement of an ancient, taxon-restricted paralog for the establishment of the tagmatic boundary that defines Chelicerata.

                Introduction Actinomycosis is an uncommon inflammatory bacterial disease caused by Actinomyces species, especially Actinomyces Israeli. Abdominopelvic forms are relatively rare and may involve the colon as a solid mass, mimicking a malignant tumor. Case presentation A 68-year-old Tunisian man, with a history of diabetes, hypertension, penicillin allergy, and renal failure, presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bowel obstruction. CT scan showed an acute intestinal obstruction upstream with obstructive tissular mass at the sigmoid colon. Emergency surgery revealed a sigmoid mass and a pre-perforative cecum. Total colectomy was performed, with ileostomy and distal end closure. Histological examination confirmed Actinomyces infection. The patient was then placed on long-term doxycycline and Bactrim, with no recurrence over a 9-month follow-up period. Conclusion Abdominal actinomycosis, though rare, presents diagnostic challenges. It can be mistaken for malignancy, leading to unnecessary surgery in non-complicated cases, since it is effectively treated by antibiotics. In complicated cases, a combined approach involving both surgery and antibiotic therapy is necessary until the infection is completely eradicated.

                Background Bacterial infections continue to pose a global health challenge, driven by antibiotic resistance and septicemia. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in bacterial infections versus non-infectious causes of inflammation. Methods A prospective study included 164 adult patients who were divided into two groups: a group of patients with confirmed bacterial infections and a second group of patients with other diagnoses (inflammatory pathologies, neoplasms, venous thromboembolic diseases, etc.). NLR and PLR values were compared between the bacterial infection group and the non-infectious causes group and the diagnostic performances of NLR and PLR for detecting bacterial infections were evaluated in comparison with other infection markers. Results NLR and PLR were significantly higher in bacterial infections (p < 10^-6), and NLR was correlated positively with inflammation markers. NLR and PLR demonstrated significant potential in diagnosing bacterial infections, with an AUC of 0.72 and 0.60, respectively, using the following cutoff values: 4.3 for NLR and 183 for PLR. Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of NLR and PLR as adjunctive tools for bacterial infection diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23635?af=R">Time cells in the retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

                The human voice is a potent social signal and a distinctive marker of individual identity. As individuals go through puberty, their voices undergo acoustic changes, setting them apart from others. In this article, we propose that hormonal fluctuations in conjunction with morphological vocal tract changes during puberty establish a sensitive developmental phase that affects the monitoring of the adolescent voice and, specifically, self–other distinction. Furthermore, the protracted maturation of brain regions responsible for voice processing, coupled with the dynamically evolving social environment of adolescents, likely disrupts a clear differentiation of the self-voice from others’ voices. This socioneuroendocrine framework offers a holistic understanding of voice monitoring during adolescence.

                Viruses are ubiquitous in nature and play key roles in various ecosystems. Notably, some viruses (e.g. bacteriophage) exhibit alternative life cycles, such as chronic infections without cell lysis. However, the impact of chronic infections and their interactions with the host organisms remains largely unknown. Here, we found for the first time that polysaccharides induced the production of multiple temperate phages infecting two deep-sea <i>Lentisphaerae</i> strains (WC36 and zth2). Through physiological assays, genomic analysis, and transcriptomics assays, we found these bacteriophages were released via a chronic style without host cell lysis, which might reprogram host polysaccharide metabolism through the potential auxiliary metabolic genes. The findings presented here, together with recent discoveries made on the reprogramming of host energy-generating metabolisms by chronic bacteriophages, shed light on the poorly explored marine virus–host interaction and bring us closer to understanding the potential role of chronic viruses in marine ecosystems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94995">Damage-induced basal epithelial cell migration modulates the spatial organization of redox signaling and sensory neuron regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial damage leads to early reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which regulates sensory neuron regeneration and tissue repair. How the initial type of tissue injury influences early damage signaling and regenerative growth of sensory axons remains unclear. Previously we reported that thermal injury triggers distinct early tissue responses in larval zebrafish. Here, we found that thermal but not mechanical injury impairs sensory axon regeneration and function. Real-time imaging revealed an immediate tissue response to thermal injury characterized by the rapid Arp2/3-dependent migration of keratinocytes, which was associated with tissue scale ROS production and sustained sensory axon damage. Isotonic treatment was sufficient to limit keratinocyte movement, spatially restrict ROS production, and rescue sensory neuron function. These results suggest that early keratinocyte dynamics regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of long-term signaling in the wound microenvironment during tissue repair.

                Meiotic progression requires coordinated assembly and disassembly of protein complexes involved in chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination. Mouse TRIP13 and its ortholog Pch2 are instrumental in remodeling HORMA domain proteins. HORMAD proteins are associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes but depleted from the synaptonemal complex (SC) of synapsed homologs. Here we report that TRIP13 localizes to the synapsed SC in early pachytene spermatocytes and to telomeres throughout meiotic prophase I. Loss of TRIP13 leads to meiotic arrest and thus sterility in both sexes. <i>Trip13</i>-null meiocytes exhibit abnormal persistence of HORMAD1 and HOMRAD2 on synapsed SC and chromosome asynapsis that preferentially affects XY and centromeric ends. These major phenotypes are consistent with reported phenotypes of <i>Trip13</i> hypomorph alleles. <i>Trip13</i> heterozygous mice exhibit meiotic defects that are less severe than the <i>Trip13</i>-null mice, showing that TRIP13 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis. Localization of TRIP13 to the synapsed SC is independent of SC axial element proteins such as REC8 and SYCP2/SYCP3. Terminal FLAG-tagged TRIP13 proteins are functional and recapitulate the localization of native TRIP13 to SC and telomeres. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved localization of TRIP13/Pch2 to the synapsed chromosomes provides an explanation for dissociation of HORMA domain proteins upon synapsis in diverse organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91970">Divergent downstream biosynthetic pathways are supported by L-cysteine synthases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>’s (<i>Mtb</i>) autarkic lifestyle within the host involves rewiring its transcriptional networks to combat host-induced stresses. With the help of RNA sequencing performed under various stress conditions, we identified that genes belonging to <i>Mtb</i> sulfur metabolism pathways are significantly upregulated during oxidative stress. Using an integrated approach of microbial genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, animal experiments, chemical inhibition, and rescue studies, we investigated the biological role of non-canonical <span class="small-caps">L</span>-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2. While transcriptome signatures of <i>RvΔcysM</i> and <i>RvΔcysK2</i> appear similar under regular growth conditions, we observed unique transcriptional signatures when subjected to oxidative stress. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of key downstream metabolites, viz. mycothiol and ergothioneine, to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. This revealed the significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis. CysM and CysK2 independently facilitate <i>Mtb</i> survival by alleviating host-induced redox stress, suggesting they are not fully redundant during infection. With the help of genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that CysM and CysK2 serve as unique, attractive targets for adjunct therapy to combat mycobacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98677">Opposing actions of co-released GABA and neurotensin on the activity of preoptic neurons and on body temperature</a></h4>

              
                Neurotensin (Nts) is a neuropeptide acting as a neuromodulator in the brain. Pharmacological studies have identified Nts as a potent hypothermic agent. The medial preoptic area, a region that plays an important role in the control of thermoregulation, contains a high density of neurotensinergic neurons and Nts receptors. The conditions in which neurotensinergic neurons play a role in thermoregulation are not known. In this study, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons induced a small hyperthermia. In vitro, optogenetic stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons resulted in synaptic release of GABA and net inhibition of the preoptic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (Adcyap1) neurons firing activity. GABA-A receptor antagonist or genetic deletion of Slc32a1 (VGAT) in Nts neurons unmasked also an excitatory effect that was blocked by a Nts receptor 1 antagonist. Stimulation of preoptic Nts neurons lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> resulted in excitation of <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons and hypothermia. Mice lacking <i>Slc32a1</i> expression in Nts neurons presented changes in the fever response and in the responses to heat or cold exposure as well as an altered circadian rhythm of body temperature. Chemogenetic activation of all Nts neurons in the brain induced a 4–5°C hypothermia, which could be blocked by Nts receptor antagonists in the preoptic area. Chemogenetic activation of preoptic neurotensinergic projections resulted in robust excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endogenously released Nts can induce potent hypothermia and that excitation of preoptic <i>Adcyap1</i> neurons is the cellular mechanism that triggers this response.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91260">PKR activation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-transgenic mice with nephropathy</a></h4>

              
                HIV disease remains prevalent in the USA and chronic kidney disease remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-1-positive patients. Host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a sensor for viral dsRNA, including HIV-1. We show that PKR inhibition by compound C16 ameliorates the HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) kidney phenotype in the Tg26 transgenic mouse model, with reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction. Combined analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was one of the most downregulated pathways and identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) as a potential mediating factor. We identified in Tg26 mice a novel proximal tubular cell cluster enriched in mitochondrial transcripts. Podocytes showed high levels of HIV-1 gene expression and dysregulation of cytoskeleton-related genes, and these cells dedifferentiated. In injured proximal tubules, cell-cell interaction analysis indicated activation of the pro-fibrogenic PKR-STAT3-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-D pathway. These findings suggest that PKR inhibition and mitochondrial rescue are potential novel therapeutic approaches for HIVAN.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95028">Detection of TurboID fusion proteins by fluorescent streptavidin outcompetes antibody signals and visualises targets not accessible to antibodies</a></h4>

              
                Immunofluorescence localises proteins via fluorophore-labelled antibodies. However, some proteins evade detection due to antibody-accessibility issues or because they are naturally low abundant or antigen density is reduced by the imaging method. Here, we show that the fusion of the target protein to the biotin ligase TurboID and subsequent detection of biotinylation by fluorescent streptavidin offers an ‘all in one’ solution to these restrictions. For all proteins tested, the streptavidin signal was significantly stronger than an antibody signal, markedly improving the sensitivity of expansion microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy. Importantly, proteins within phase-separated regions, such as the central channel of the nuclear pores, the nucleolus, or RNA granules, were readily detected with streptavidin, while most antibodies failed. When TurboID is used in tandem with an HA epitope tag, co-probing with streptavidin and anti-HA can map antibody-accessibility and we created such a map for the trypanosome nuclear pore. Lastly, we show that streptavidin imaging resolves dynamic, temporally, and spatially distinct sub-complexes and, in specific cases, reveals a history of dynamic protein interaction. In conclusion, streptavidin imaging has major advantages for the detection of lowly abundant or inaccessible proteins and in addition, provides information on protein interactions and biophysical environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91097">Long-distance electron transport in multicellular freshwater cable bacteria</a></h4>

              
                Filamentous multicellular cable bacteria perform centimeter-scale electron transport in a process that couples oxidation of an electron donor (sulfide) in deeper sediment to the reduction of an electron acceptor (oxygen or nitrate) near the surface. While this electric metabolism is prevalent in both marine and freshwater sediments, detailed electronic measurements of the conductivity previously focused on the marine cable bacteria (<i>Candidatus</i> Electrothrix), rather than freshwater cable bacteria, which form a separate genus (<i>Candidatus</i> Electronema) and contribute essential geochemical roles in freshwater sediments. Here, we characterize the electron transport characteristics of <i>Ca</i>. Electronema cable bacteria from Southern California freshwater sediments. Current–voltage measurements of intact cable filaments bridging interdigitated electrodes confirmed their persistent conductivity under a controlled atmosphere and the variable sensitivity of this conduction to air exposure. Electrostatic and conductive atomic force microscopies mapped out the characteristics of the cell envelope’s nanofiber network, implicating it as the conductive pathway in a manner consistent with previous findings in marine cable bacteria. Four-probe measurements of microelectrodes addressing intact cables demonstrated nanoampere currents up to 200 μm lengths at modest driving voltages, allowing us to quantify the nanofiber conductivity at 0.1 S/cm for freshwater cable bacteria filaments under our measurement conditions. Such a high conductivity can support the remarkable sulfide-to-oxygen electrical currents mediated by cable bacteria in sediments. These measurements expand the knowledgebase of long-distance electron transport to the freshwater niche while shedding light on the underlying conductive network of cable bacteria.

	<p>Background: Psychotic disorders are major psychiatric disorders that can impact multiple domains including physical, social, and psychological functioning within individuals with these conditions. Being able to better predict the outcomes of psychotic disorders will allow clinicians to identify illness subgroups and optimize treatment strategies in a timely manner. Objective: In this scoping review, we aimed to examine the accuracy of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with psychotic disorders as well as determine the relevant predictors of these outcomes. Methods: This review was guided by the PRISMA Guidelines for Scoping Reviews. Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant published articles in English until 1 February 2024. Results: Thirty articles were included in this review. These studies were mainly conducted in the West (63%) and Asia (37%) and published within the last 5 years (83.3%). The clinical outcomes included symptomatic improvements, illness course, and social functioning. The machine learning models utilized data from various sources including clinical, cognitive, and biological variables such as genetic, neuroimaging measures. In terms of main machine learning models used, the most common approaches were support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, and linear regression models. No specific machine learning approach outperformed the other approaches consistently across the studies, and an overall range of predictive accuracy was observed with an AUC from 0.58 to 0.95. Specific predictors of clinical outcomes included demographic characteristics (gender, socioeconomic status, accommodation, education, and employment); social factors (activity level and interpersonal relationships); illness features (number of relapses, duration of relapses, hospitalization rates, cognitive impairments, and negative and disorganization symptoms); treatment (prescription of first-generation antipsychotics, high antipsychotic doses, clozapine, use of electroconvulsive therapy, and presence of metabolic syndrome); and structural and functional neuroimaging abnormalities, especially involving the temporal and frontal brain regions. Conclusions: The current review highlights the potential and need to further refine AI and machine learning models in parsing out the complex interplay of specific variables that contribute to the clinical outcome prediction of psychotic disorders.</p>

	<p>Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is typically characterized by headaches and vision loss. However, neurocognitive deficits are also described. Our study aimed to test the influence of therapeutic lumbar puncture on the latter. Methods: A total of 15 patients with IIH were tested with a battery of neurocognitive tests at baseline and after therapeutic lumbar drainage. Hereby, Logical Memory of the Wechsler Memory Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised Edition (WMS-R), the California Verbal Learning Test Short Version (CVLT), alertness, selective attention, and word fluency were used. Changes in cognitive functioning in the course of CSF pressure lowering were analysed and compared with age, sex, and education-matched healthy controls. Results: Before intervention, scores of Logical Memory, the RWT, and the HADS-D were significantly lower in IIH patients compared to matched controls. After short-term normalization of CSF pressure, the RWT improved significantly. Additionally, significant positive correlations were found between headache intensity and subjective impairment, as well as between BMI and CSF opening pressure. Conclusions: Our findings confirm lower performance in terms of long-term verbal memory and word fluency compared to controls, as well as depressive symptoms in IIH patients. Significant improvement after short-term normalization of intracranial pressure by means of CSF drainage was seen only for word fluency. This indicates that short-term normalization of CSF pressure is not sufficient to normalize observed neurocognitive deficits.</p>

	<p>Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists, such as betahistine (BHTE), have shown significant potential in treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders due to their neuroprotective properties. This study investigated BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neurotoxicity, which is associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Rats were divided into groups and pre-treated with BHTE (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 30 days, followed by LPS administration (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 consecutive days to induce neurotoxicity. LPS exposure resulted in cognitive impairment, as evidenced by performance deficits in maze tests, and a significant reduction in brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Additionally, LPS led to increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Pre-treatment with BHTE effectively counteracted these effects, improving cognitive performance and restoring ACh levels. BHTE significantly reduced LPS-induced increases in pro-inflammatory markers (COX-2, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and IL-6) while enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;1). Furthermore, BHTE improved mitochondrial function by increasing enzyme levels (MRCC-I, II, and IV) and boosted anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and antioxidant defenses (GSH and catalase). BHTE also reduced apoptosis markers, including pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3, and oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA). Molecular modeling studies revealed that BHTE effectively binds to key enzymes involved in neuroinflammation and apoptosis (AChE, COX-2, and caspase-3), with binding free energies between 4 and 5 kcal/mol, interacting with critical residues. These findings underscore BHTE&amp;amp;rsquo;s multifaceted neuroprotective effects against LPS-induced neurotoxicity, offering potential therapeutic avenues for managing neuroinflammation and related neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

	<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that modulates the noradrenergic activity of the locus coeruleus (LC). Yet, there is still uncertainty about the most effective stimulation and reliable outcome parameters. In a double blind, sham-controlled study including a sample of healthy young individuals (N = 29), we compared a shorter (3.4 s) and a longer (30 s) stimulation duration and investigated the effects of taVNS (real vs. sham) on saliva samples (alpha amylase and cortisol concentration), pupil (pupillary light reflex and pupil size at rest) and EEG data (alpha and theta activity at rest, ERPs for No-Go signals), and cognitive tasks (Go/No-Go and Stop Signal Tasks). Salivary alpha amylase concentration was significantly increased in the real as compared to sham stimulation for the 30 s stimulation condition. In the 3.4 s stimulation condition, we found prolonged reaction times and increased error rates in the Go/No-Go task and increased maximum acceleration in the pupillary light reflex. For the other outcomes, no significant differences were found. Our results show that prolonged stimulation increases salivary alpha-amylase, which was expected from the functional properties of the LC. The finding of longer response times to short taVNS stimulation was not expected and cannot be explained by an increase in LC activity. We also discuss the difficulties in assessing pupil size as an expression of taVNS-mediated LC functional changes.</p>

	<p>Selection history is widely accepted as a vital source in attention control. Reward history indicates that a learned association captures attention even when the reward is no longer presented, while statistical learning indicates that a learned probability exerts its influence on attentional control (facilitation or inhibition). Existing research has shown that the effects of the reward history and statistical learning are additive, suggesting that these two components influence attention priority through different pathways. In the current study, leveraging the temporal resolution advantages of EEG, we explored whether these two components represent independent sources of attentional bias. The results revealed faster responses to the target at the high-probability location compared to low-probability locations. Both the target and distractor at high-probability locations elicited larger early Pd (50&amp;amp;ndash;150 ms) and Pd (150&amp;amp;ndash;250 ms) components. The reward distractor slowed the target search and elicited a larger N2pc (180&amp;amp;ndash;350 ms). Further, no interaction between statistical learning and the reward history was observed in RTs or N2pc. The different types of temporal progression in attention control indicate that statistical learning and the reward history independently modulate the attention priority map.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Our team has previously introduced the Single-Step Pedicle Screw System (SSPSS), which eliminates the need for K-wires, as a safe and effective method for percutaneous minimally invasive spine (MIS) pedicle screw placement. Despite this, there are ongoing concerns about the reliability and accuracy of screw placement in MIS procedures without traditional tools like K-wires and Jamshidi needles. To address these concerns, we evaluated the accuracy of the SSPSS workflow by comparing the planned intraoperative screw trajectories with the final screw positions. Traditionally, screw placement accuracy has been assessed by grading the final screw position using postoperative CT scans. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent lumbar interbody fusion, using intraoperative 3D navigation for screw placement. The planned screw trajectories were saved in the navigation system during each procedure, and postoperative CT scans were used to evaluate the implanted screws. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the Gertzbein and Robbins classification scores of the planned trajectories and the final screw positions. Accuracy was defined as a final screw position matching the classification of the planned trajectory. (3) Results: Out of 206 screws, 196 (95%) were accurately placed, with no recorded complications. (4) Conclusions: The SSPSS workflow, even without K-wires and other traditional instruments, facilitates accurate and reliable pedicle screw placement.</p>
